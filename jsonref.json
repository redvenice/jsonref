Turkey threatens us. In an attack, we can guarantee nothing. \u0027The danger of escape of these jihadists is great, and if it comes to a confrontation with Ankara, then the ISIS fighters will again be an active threat to Europe and the West. \u0027We call for an international conference to discuss this issue that we Kurds can not solve on their own.

Some of the show was great – notably, Olivia Colman’s gloriously ebullient Best Actress speech, Rami Malek’s equally endearing response to winning Best Actor          I loved Spike Lee behaving in the same lunatic way he does at New York Knicks gamesBut what it didn’t do was make me laugh.Instead, it dripped with insufferable identity politics, Trump-bashing, and a series of box ticking awards that smacked of Hollywood trying to make itself look as worthy and virtuous as possible.‘I can’t believe a film about menstruation won an Oscar’ wept director Rayka Zehtabchi for her (powerful) film Period. End of Sentence.Really?I’d have been more shocked if it hadn’t.After all, the main winners last night were a film about a gay immigrant rock star, a film about a black superhero with an almost entirely black cast, a film about racial injustice in segregated U.S. South in the 1960s, a film about a black detective who goes undercover with the Ku Klux Klan – and Roma, a beautifully made but almost unwatchably dull, depressing and painfully slow black-and-white film about a Mexican maid, in Spanish with subtitles.I’m not disputing the inidual merits of any of the winners, but it’s hard not to avoid the conclusion that Hollywood – whose Academy voters are predominantly old white guys – is now doing everything in its power to avoid more of the‘White Oscars’ backlashes of recent years.Even the red carpet morphed into a ‘woke’ farce as Pose star Billy Porter turned up in a tuxedo-skirt, presumably to make himself the new poster person for gender fluidity.‘OMG! He’s magnificent!’ screamed Twitter.          The red carpet morphed into a ‘woke’ farce as Pose star Billy Porter turned up in a tuxedo-skirt, presumably to make himself the new poster person for gender fluidity.‘OMG! He’s ridiculous!’ I screamed back.In the end, the only real amusement came from watching people I’d never heard of, and frankly was quite happy never to have heard of, making fools of themselves on stage during the seemingly endless tedious production categories.The hapless trio from Vice who won the make-up and hair award made collectively the worst speech in Oscars history - a bumbling, stumbling, jabbering, linguistic fiasco that became the perfect evidential argument for sliding these kind of awards into commercial breaks, as was intended this year until a massive furore from ‘the industry’ forced the producers to do a U-turn.But at least they were riveting, for all the wrong reasons.When Green Book won Best Screenplay, one of the writers (and the movie’s director) Peter Farrelly pulled out a sheet of paper and began dementedly reciting the names of what seemed like every single human being he’d ever met.I counted at least 40 people on his turgid list of mainly nonentities.          When Green Book won Best Screenplay, one of the writers (and the movie’s director) Peter Farrelly pulled out a sheet of paper and began dementedly reciting names Important to him, I’m sure – but utterly irrelevant to the billion people watching around the world.Oh for a trap door that could have sucked him down into the bowels of the Kodak Theatre and spared us this orgy of self-indulgence.And what about the ridiculous woman who made Free Solo, the extraordinary documentary about climber Alex Honnold? She barely mentioned the guy who actually risked his life for her bloody film, even as he stood three feet away from her on stage!          Documentary maker Chai Vasarhelyi (in gray) barely mentioned the guy who actually risked his life for her bloody film, even as he stood three feet away from her! ( second from right)But for me, the single most depressing moment came with presenting duo Awkwafina and John Mulaney, who were unfunny, boring and unctuously sycophantic.‘I want these people to like me to a degree that is embarrassing,’ gushed Mulaney, and you could see he really meant it.‘Wait, why are we still here?’ exclaimed Awkwafina, as they remained on stage to introduce a second award.  The single most depressing moment came with  Awkwafina and John Mulaney, who were unfunny, boring and unctuously sycophantic. Why wasn’t Ricky Gervais there to rip into people instead of these fawning clowns?I asked myself the exact same question, with this supplementary: Why wasn’t Ricky Gervais there to rip into people instead of these fawning clowns?Yet today, I’ve read many people raving about them and saying they were so ‘hilarious’ they should host the whole show next year.To which I say: Hayi!

May is expected to ask them to endorse her plan to renegotiate the backstop.It is not a new \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 to approve or reject the Brexit deal. Backbench MPs are likely to put forward amendments containing alternative plans - but whatever happens, the stage is set for another showdown on March 12.This is the third time since the \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 on January 15 MPs have voted on Brexit. May promised the votes would happen as a concession to rebels while she negotiated to stop them taking no deal off the table.  What amendments might there be? Formal amendments have not yet been tabled but they are expected to include:  Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper and Tory Oliver Letwin want to change the law to order the PM to delay Brexit if there is no deal in place by March 13. This would mean suspending the normal rules of the Commons to allow backbench MPs to introduce legislation.Tories Simon Hart and Andrew have a similar amendment that makes a statement the PM should delay Brexit if there is no deal by March 13. There may be a second referendum amendment. Labour has said it will back one as an alternative to no deal or the Tory deal.Tory Alberto Costa is separately pushing an amendment seeking more guarantees for EU citizens in Britain in the event of no deal.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will table his usual amendment setting out Labour promises for a Brexit based on a permanent customs union with the EU. It will fail.SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford will table an amendment - usually one complaining about Brexit. It will fail. Will any of them carry? Amendments for delaying Brexit or a second referendum could pass - but all options look likely to depend on what happens at the second meaningful vote by March 12.May\u0027s concessions today on votes on March 12, 13 and 14 make it less likely any of the rival plans will pass tomorrow. The Corbyn and Blackford amendments will definitely fail.  Tory Remainer ministers are lashed for \u0027kamikaze tactics\u0027 in...\u0027Leave voters won\u0027t have it\u0027: FIFTY Labour MPs threaten to...Share this articleWhat is the second meaningful vote? To get her deal into law, May has to win a specific vote approving her deal. She has tried once before on January 15 and lost by 230 votes.The PM has promised this will happen no later than March 12. If she wins then, she has said Brexit should happen on time and the Government will scramble to get the necessary laws in place. What happens if May loses the second vote? May has told MPs they will then have to choose between delaying Brexit for further negotiations or leaving the EU without a deal if the reject the deal by March 12.On March 13, there will be a vote for MPs to say yes or no to no deal.If they say no, on March 14 MPs will be asked to say yes or no to delaying Brexit.If the House also votes no to delay, backbench MPs - backed by Jeremy Corbyn and most Labour MPs - will probably try to push for a second referendum.  Why do people say there needs to be a second referendum?Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal has no majority in Parliament - and it is not clear any other deal has a majority either, even if one could be negotiated.Passing the question back to voters is seen by some as a way to end the impasse and give a clear instruction to politicians on what to do.Some campaigners also say the 2016 referendum was not an informed choice because too many of the implications of Leave were unknown. Britain\u0027s view on whether it should Leave or Remain in the EU is little changed in the more than three years since the referendum. Pictured are the dozens of polls since June 23, 2016  What do critics think?Many people - led by the Prime Minister herself - say a new vote on Brexit would betray the people who voted Leave in 2016. They insist there was a clear order from the public to Leave the EU and politicians must follow it, working out the details for themselves.Unionists also complain that accepting a new referendum on Brexit would pave the way for another referendum on Scottish independence, threatening the future of the UK. Some politicians also feel it would simply reopen the wounds from the 2016 battle without really deciding anything more clearly.  What needs to happen for a referendum to happen?Parliament would need to pass a new law for a referendum to be held. This process alone would take weeks and would likely be very controversial.Before that can even happen, for political reasons there would probably have to be some kind of moment creating a \u0027mandate\u0027 for a new referendum as it is something neither of the main parties promised at the last election.This might be a simple vote of MPs after Mrs May\u0027s deal has been rejected. The Government could call such a vote at any time. Labour also has some opportunities to call a vote - though winning such a vote would have less power.It could even be a whole general election where one or more sides puts a new referendum in their manifesto. What would the question and be who decides? Nobody knows for sure - and this is probably the hardest question of all.Some say it should be a simple repeat of last time, with Leave or Remain on the ballot paper. Others say it should be Remain versus Mrs May\u0027s Brexit deal.Others advocate a two stage referendum - between Remain and Leave, followed by Mrs May\u0027s deal versus No Deal if Leave wins. Still others say there could be multiple questions on the ballot paper, possible using a ranking system known as alternative vote.The Electoral Commission would make a recommendation and MPs would make the final decision on what the question would be. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/02/26/14/4FFB1CC300000578-6746889-image-m-17_1551190198108.jpg","title":"Cricket ace Alastair Cook gets knighthood Queen","story":"Cook (pictured left being presented with honour from the Queen today, and right)  became the first England cricketer to be knighted since all-rounder Ian Botham in 2007          Father of three Sir Alastair, 34, (pictured after scoring a century against India last year) retired from international cricket in the summer and ended his career with 12,472 Test runs and 33 Test centuries - both England recordsThe league\u0027s CEO since 1999, he stepped down from the role at the end of last year.Cook became the first England cricketer to be knighted since all-rounder Ian Botham in 2007.He joins an exclusive club of former England cricketers to hold the title, including Jack Hobbs, Len Hutton and Colin Cowdrey.He was also awarded an MBE in 2011 and a CBE five years later.Cook, speaking after the investiture ceremony, said: \u0027Seeing my name up there in whatever capacity - you just don\u0027t get used to it.

We are discussing with the EU what additions or changes can now be made to the political declaration outlining that future relationship that will increase people’s confidence in the ambition of both sides to agree to it as soon as possible.And to protect workers’ rights, a concern for many MPs as we leave the EU, we will give Parliament a vote on whether it wishes to follow suit whenever the EU changes its standards. The UK leads the way on workers’ rights, environmental protections and health and safety – as we leave the EU, we will continue to enhance them.I firmly believe that a deal is within our grasp.Yesterday I committed in Parliament to give MPs a second meaningful vote on the withdrawal agreement by March 12 at the latest. I am confident that we can win that vote.

We don’t necessarily expect every year to be quite the golden year that was,” said McHale.Keren David, author of eight YA books, told the : “I think there’s a widespread feeling of disappointment with the general state of the market for UK YA at the moment. Many people are getting very low offers, and next to no promotion. Most people can’t afford to carry on writing YA if advances drop to £1,000.” The charts show that UK YA readers are currently flocking to American writers, with last year’s top seller being US author Karen McManus’s thriller One of Us Is Lying. Following her in the Top Five were American Angie Thomas’s hit debut The Hate U Give, Nigerian-American Tomi Adeyemi’s Children of Blood and Bone, American Becky Albertalli’s Love Simon, and Jamaican-American Nicola Yoon’s Everything, Everything. Just one UK author made the 2018 Top 10: Michelle Magorian, for the classic title Goodnight Mister Tom.“There is still widespread ignorance about what YA is (‘It’s all vampires!’ ‘It’s all worthy sicklit!’) It occupies an uneasy place between children’s and adults, and in the main, the only books that get a lot of promotion are the American ones,” David said. “Whether the British market can ever be big enough to sustain YA writers is doubtful. I think it’s sad if all youth culture is filtered through an American viewpoint. It means British kids are less engaged with their own country and experiences.”Author Sheena Wilkinson agreed. “I think YA has become a slightly pejorative term – and when you aren’t having a great range of books published it’s possible to see why. When I go into bookshops I see a lot of YA, but not a lot of ersity. I see a lot of imported YA, mostly from the US,” said Wilkinson, author of seven YA novels. “Teens have always embraced US culture, that’s nothing new. But it seems a shame that this is promoted at the expense of homegrown writers. Not out of any wish to be parochial, but because it’s hard enough for writers to make a living in what is essentially a small market.”McHale added: “It is quite easy for the big US names to dominate in a way that doesn’t happen in other genres, and that can pose a few problems for getting UK authors to that same level of noise.” But despite the dominance of Americans, the Waterstones bookseller said that YA fiction had “moved quite firmly away” from the dystopian fantasy that began to dominate the charts a decade ago. The Hunger Games, published in 2008, led the charge, telling of a 16-year-old heroine in a post-apocalyptic future. It was followed by huge series including James Dashner’s Maze Runner titles, first published in 2009, and Roth’s Divergent books, launched in 2011. But as readers began to experience a surfeit of such fiction, McHale pointed to a number of genres selling well in YA today Waterstones’ “older fiction” shortlist for its children’s book prize ranges from Children of Blood and Bone, which draws on African mythology, to Malcolm Duffy’s Me Mam. Me Dad. Me, which follows the life of a 14-year-old Geordie boy. “What is brilliant is the range of genres YA is an age category not a genre,” said McHale.What is not so brilliant, said children’s books consultant Jake Hope is the decision by publishers to price YA titles the same as adult mainstream fiction. He pointed to the £7.99 price point for both The Hate U Give and Children of Blood and Bone – the same amount charged for paperbacks of David Baldacci’s The Fallen and Anthony Horowitz’s The Word Is Murder.“Isn’t there an inherent imbalance in the fact that young adults, often in full-time education or, if employed, in entry positions – are expected to have the same disposable income as adults? That might not be such an issue were it not for the fact that education spend is down,” he said.And the decline in YA sales comes alongside a drop in lending of children’s books at public libraries. School libraries are also in dire straits: the School Library Association estimates its numbers have declined by at least 1,000 members since 2006, with schools trying to save money by cutting their librarians. Library spend on books decreased last year to £29.1m. Experts fear these factors will have a long-term impact on reading habits.“Formerly, a lot of YA was bought by school libraries and public libraries. They have had budgets slashed and are increasingly getting rid of the professional librarians who know about what young people read,” said Wilkinson.“Realistically, £29.1m is a tiny amount for something that holds the potential to benefit so many,” said Hope. “Reading is a great equaliser and is the biggest lever of social change. But to achieve that, there has to be access to books.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c170d8e122508778d479dc02818c27c336735384/0_151_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35e88f9d22d4627d238cf704fb88a02b","title":"new philip pullman novel the secret commonwealth book of dust","story":"The second volume of his Book of Dust trilogy finds Lyra now a student, facing adult problems as she travels across Europe and into AsiaSeven years after readers last saw Lyra Silvertongue, sitting on a bench in Oxford’s Botanic Garden, Philip Pullman’s most beloved heroine is set to return as an adult this autumn in the second volume of his trilogy The Book of Dust.Pullman announced on Wednesday that The Secret Commonwealth would be published in October, just ahead of BBC One’s TV adaptation of his bestselling His Dark Materials trilogy, starring Dafne Keen as the child Lyra, Ruth Wilson as the sinister Mrs Coulter and James McAvoy as Lord Asriel.The first Book of Dust novel, La Belle Sauvage, introduces Lyra as a baby, as a huge flood hits Oxford and the 11-year-old Malcolm Polstead becomes her protector. The Secret Commonwealth is set 20 years after those events, and seven years after the end of The Amber Spyglass, the concluding volume in the His Dark Materials trilogy.Lyra is no longer a child and life, warned Pullman, is not easy for this grownup version of a character readers first met as an 11-year-old running wild in Oxford with her daemon Pantalaimon. Now a student, she will travel across Europe and into Asia as she searches for a town said to be haunted by daemons.“Things have been biding their time, waiting for the right moment to reveal their consequences for Lyra Silvertongue,” said the novelist. “The Secret Commonwealth tells the continuing story of the impact on Lyra’s life of the search for, and the fear of, Dust. I found it intriguing and deeply exciting to discover how great events can turn on a little moment, and how revenge can be nurtured and fed and watered till it grows beyond control.”An early extract shows conflict between Lyra and Pan, as the daemon criticises her for being pessimistic. “You used to be optimistic. You used to think that whatever we did would turn out well. Even after we came back from the north, you used to think that. Now you’re cautious, you’re anxious,” he tells her, as the pair deliberate what to do after witnessing a murder. Lyra “knew he was right, but it wasn’t right that he should speak to her accusingly, as if it was something to blame her for. ‘I used to be young,’ was all she could find to say,” writes Pullman.“It was enthralling for me to remember how powerfully and passionately our minds and opinions can be turned by reading a particular book at the right time. Lyra, as a student, is finding that out. She is also discovering a new and difficult aspect to her relationship with Pantalaimon, and other things about daemons that she never suspected,” said the novelist.But, really, Pullman continued, “those things are background”. “At the heart of the book are Lyra, the young woman we saw first as a girl of 12 and then as a baby, and Malcolm, whose life as a boy became involved with hers and who now finds their lives helplessly entangled again and how some emotions can last a lifetime, and others change beyond recognition,” he said. “It’s the story of some people we know, and others we’ll meet for the first time. Their journey is going to take them far from their homeland towards a mysterious desert in central Asia, where they hope to find, at last, the secret of Dust.”The Secret Commonwealth will be published by David Fickling Books in association with Penguin Random House UK on 3 October. The publisher called it “a timely exploration of what it is to be human, to grow up and make sense of the world around us, from one of the UK’s greatest writers”.“Like the original readers of His Dark Materials, Lyra has grown up. Her concerns are adult ones, and this new perspective – coupled with Philip’s unflinching look at the human condition and his extraordinary storytelling – makes for a breathtaking read,” said Penguin Random House Children’s managing director Francesca Dow.Dow compared the book to dystopian classics The Handmaid’s Tale and Never Let Me Go, saying it “shows us a darker parallel world whose troubles echo our own”. Pullman has previously quipped that The Book of Dust should be called “His Darker Materials”.‘It used to be you who was impulsive,’ said Pan, ‘and me who kept holding you back. We’re different now.’She nodded. ‘Well, you know, things change … This isn’t just shoplifting. This is murder.’‘I know.

That can’t be right.’‘That’s another thing,’ he said.‘You used to be optimistic. You used to think that whatever we did would turn out well.

The average selling price was just over £215,000,The profit from each house it sells has nearly tripled since 2013, when the government introduced the help-to-buy scheme in an attempt to help struggling families buy their first home. Last year the company paid an average of just £31,536 for each plot of land, and spent £112,295 on actually building each home. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, accused Persimmon of “pinching their profits from the public purse”, adding: “Far from benefiting first time buyers, the major effect of help-to-buy is to drive up demand while having no effect on supply. The result is not help for those who need it, but a boost to the profits of big developers.”Cable demanded that the government immediately end the help-to-buy scheme and take action to crack down on “outrageous” executive pay. “This greed is coming at the expense of the public purse through the subsidies in help-to-buy,” he said. “Help-to-buy is a scam, enriching developers while forcing buyers off the ladder by pushing up prices.”Greg Beales, the campaign director of the housing charity Shelter, said: “Persimmon represents everything that is wrong with the housebuilding system. The firm has generated huge profits from taxpayer subsidies whilst doing very little to help solve the housing crisis we face.“Piecemeal schemes such as help-to-buy have made the situation even worse by inflating house prices and giving big developers a leg-up – while doing next to nothing to help those most in need of a genuinely affordable home.”Many Persimmon customers have complained that their homes are poorly built, with pipes springing leaks and windows cracking just days after they moved in. Persimmon has been awarded only a three-star Home Builders Federation customer service rating every year since 2014, compared with four and five stars for its major rivals.Victoria Baker, who bought a £380,000 five-bedroom Persimmon house in Ingleby Barwick, near Stockton, last year described the building work on her home as horrific. “We noticed leaks straight away as we were putting things away under the sink there was a pool of water under the sink in the kitchen,” she said. Baker, who lives in a home built by Charles Church, a brand owned by Persimmon, said numerous other leaks later appeared. She is part of a Facebook group called “Charles Church (Persimmon) Homes From Hell”.Persimmon has made so much money in recent years that it triggered a near-£500m bonus bonanza for its 150 most senior bosses. The company’s former chair quit when he recognised that the huge bonuses were wrong, but was unable to prevent them being paid out.Persimmon’s former chief executive Jeff Fairburn was eventually persuaded to give up part of his payout but still walked away with £75m. His replacement, Dave Jenkinson, collected more than £40m.The company’s huge gains from the help-to-buy scheme, in which the government provides a guaranteed interest-free loan, have sparked a ministerial review. James Brokenshire, the housing minister, is said to be “increasingly concerned by the behaviour of Persimmon”.A source close to the minister said: “Given that contracts for the 2021 extension to help-to-buy are being reviewed shortly, which overall is a great scheme helping hundreds of thousands of people into home ownership, it would be surprising if Persimmon’s approach wasn’t a point of discussion.”A government spokesman said officials would “carefully” examine the vast profits made by Persimmon and other housebuilders. “Help-to-buy will look different,” the spokesman said. “We’ve already said it will look only at first-time buyers and we will definitely not be funding leasehold properties. We will look carefully at developer performance over recent years.”Jenkinson, who was appointed Persimmon’s new chief executive on Tuesday, defended the company’s use of the help-to-buy scheme, saying the company had “helped hundreds of first time buyers” and “given them the opportunity to own their own home”. He said the help-to-buy scheme was just one element behind the firm’s financial success and the government had not contacted the company with any concern about its use of the help-to-buy scheme.More than a year ago, Fairburn pledged to set up a charity with a “substantial proportion” of his bonus but has so far failed to do so. He has not registered a charity with the Charity Commission or made any inquiries about how to set one up.Independent property expert Henry Pryor said: “There is no doubt that help-to-buy has been the crack cocaine of the housing industry. Listen carefully and you can hear the housebuilder bosses chortling into their cornflakes as taxpayers pump up the executive bonus pool.“With 100,000 kids waking up in B\u0026ampB accommodation this morning, it’s a national outrage that the government is still pouring accelerant on to the smouldering housing market. Bosses who have trousered the profits from selling to taxpayer-supported buyers have taken the place of bankers on my dart board. They have a business model, thanks to successive governments, that would make Al Capone blush.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46e9eaf870a8fe706dc2384aeb1abb6a43ecdc05/293_0_5547_3328/master/5547.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3434fc3765f00365b2a96068e45bdbde","title":"retail workers facing high unemployment thinktank finds","story":"Resolution Foundation report shows retail has the highest redundancy rate of any sectorRetail workers in Britain are more likely to face unemployment rather than finding another job amid mounting numbers of job losses on the high street, with younger staff hardest hit, according to a report.The study by the Resolution Foundation thinktank found the retail industry now has the highest rate of redundancies of any sector of the economy, amid the rapid rise of shop closures across the country.The analysis comes as growing numbers of UK retailers announce job cuts and store closures across the country, with losses at major high street employers such as M\u0026ampS, Debenhams and HMV.Growth in consumer spending eased last year, worsened by the rise in inflation that followed the Brexit vote, while changing spending habits and a move online have also harmed traditional bricks-and-mortar stores, which typically employ greater numbers of workers.Two in five ex-retail staff are unemployed for at least six months, with greater risks for younger workers. As many as three in five former retail workers are under the age of 30 – despite barely a third of the workforce being in this age bracket.Daniel Tomlinson, research and policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Life has become tougher for those leaving retail, who are more likely to find themselves unemployed – and for longer, too.“While policymakers can’t reverse major and long-lasting changes in how we shop, they can and should focus on the people and places most affected.”Although job losses in the retail sector appear to have risen in recent years, the study found there had been a long-term shift away from retail employment in the economy since 2003.“Britain, far from being a ‘nation of shopkeepers’, now has a lower share of workers in wholesale and retail than Germany,” it said.Despite repeated rounds of job losses, more than enough roles have opened up in other areas to compensate, particularly in hospitality and social care, although the rise in the redundancy rate poses fresh challenges.The report also said retail continued to be a low-paying sector, with the typical hourly wage – £8.80 – about a third lower than typical pay across the entire economy of £12.73."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43e0bcab1cda9979793445eabf93b00049e83b8e/69_0_3816_2290/master/3816.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87c51e0028a6ef2498a784e89968c0d0","title":"markets subdued geopolitical tensions investors india pakistan ftse business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial newsGood morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.After yesterday’s surge in sterling, the City is rather more subdued this morning as investors return to worrying about geopolitical issues.And there’s plenty to concern us all today.The tensions between India and Pakistan in Kashmir have escalated, with Pakistan claiming to have shot down two Indian jets this morning. This follows Delhi’s attack on what it claims was a terrorist training camp over the border.With the two sides exchanging mortar fire across the border, the situation is rapidly becoming more serious.Elsewhere, Donald Trump will be sitting down with his “friend”, North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, at their summit in Vietnam. The US president is hoping for a denuclearizion breakthrough.......However, that meeting has been dramatically overshadowed by new testimony from the president’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen.Cohen is due to tell Congress that Trump - who he dubs “a racist, a conman and a cheat” - was aware that WikiLeaks would publish emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign.My colleagues Sabrina Siddiqui and Adam Gabbatt explain why it matters:The remarkable allegations by Cohen go further than what has been made public thus far by the special counsel investigation into potential collusion between the Trump campaign in Moscow.Cohen will also suggest his instructions to lie to Congress about a possible Trump Tower deal in Moscow during the 2016 campaign came from the president – albeit not directly.So, this could easily overshadow the meeting:City trader will also be watching parliament closely, as MPs prepare for next month’s votes on whether to pass Theresa May’s Brexit deal, extend Article 50, or leave without a deal.Sterling is hovering close to yesterday’s 21-month high against the euro, at €1.165, as investors expect Brexit to be delayed. But Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, warns that there could be more volatility ahead: While the Pound is likely to extend gains amid the current optimism, the question if for how long?

They’ve been preparing for two yearsNo unnamed Labour source can mask what’s happened, and no professional Corbyn-sceptics can derail it. There is now a real prospect of another referendum. Labour has committed to several parliamentary manoeuvres including one final stab at its own Brexit, which will certainly fail another to support Yvette Cooper’s attempt to push no deal further into the realm of destructive fantasy, where it belongs and a vote on an amendment demanding that any Brexit deal approved by the Commons must be ratified in a public referendum. In that public vote, Labour will campaign to remain in the EU.“Sources” within Labour continue to deny this new reality, even as its senior frontbenchers have announced it. “It’s a disgrace,” one told me, “that unelected, unsourced voices are briefing against Labour’s frontbench.” “If they want to speak for the Labour party,” a staffer said, “they should stand for the Labour party.” The position as it stands now is not the seismic shift some suggest. It is a continuation of the policy adopted at Labour’s party conference last September. And credit for it belongs with the grassroots of the Labour party.Jeremy Corbyn’s Euroscepticism has always been overplayed, and absurdly so: this supposedly committed Bennite is a keen supporter of the single market, the core element of transnational cooperation that Tony Benn actually objected to. But more importantly, if you want to understand why so many predictions were wrong, Corbyn’s determination for democratic renewal has been underplayed, to the point of being ignored. The desire to reconnect meaningful levers between the party and its members has always been far more salient to his politics than any old guff about socialism in one country.This isn’t to say there aren’t influential leavers around the leadership, and without Keir Starmer’s determination to stick to both the letter and spirit of September’s conference motion, this may not have been the outcome. Key unions – the TSSA and, lately, the GMB – were significant. Organisations such as Another Europe is Possible and Remain Labour did the legwork of amassing 150 motions on Brexit to take to conference in the first place. Anyone could have lost confidence in the nation’s appetite for remain, without data from Hope Not Hate and Best For Britain. And that ongoing tension many members felt, between despising Brexit as a manifestly far-right project, and wanting to maintain loyalty to a leader whose own preference was endlessly interpreted but often unclear, was bridged by Momentum. It was highly ambivalent on Europe but ultimately, also, more committed to party democracy than to a position on any single issue.Yet this new context in which we find ourselves, a real prospect of a public vote to swim out of this godforsaken Tory swamp, is a triumph of Labour members.This is important not because of any crowning determination to see credit situated where it is due – rather than ascribed, wildly, to the Independent Group. Rather, because if you want to actually know what a ratification vote would look like, and the remain campaign within it, this is no sudden scramble to put together some arguments and hope they’re different enough to the self-interested status quoism of the Stronger In campaign of 2016. Labour’s members have been working on a strategy for two years.The arguments split three ways: what does remain and reform actually mean, in terms of our relationship with the EU, and our hopes for the continent? What were the real problems unmasked by the referendum result, and what would it take to solve them? And finally, wouldn’t it be inspiring to put these tired, abstract, 60s arguments behind us and concentrate on things that matter?The left in Europe need us, and we need them. We need one another to create the first carbon-free continent, and fast. We need to fight the rise of the far right together, for so many obvious reasons, not least the paradox that violent ethno-nationalists are working tirelessly across borders to cooperate with one another, and no single nation can meet that threat working alone. We need a transnational union movement, a financial transaction tax, an enforceable floor for corporation tax between countries we need an entire constellation of cooperative measures so that no multinational can get its fingers burned over poor working conditions in Munich and immediately move to Kraków, or Stoke.We need to defend such laws and regulations as were co-created along humane and social principles, and unpick the elements of the Lisbon treaty that sought to detach the market from democratic forces and regulatory oversight. The only progressive European voice I have ever heard supporting Brexit did so on the grounds that the UK was so often the impediment to action on climate, or on workers’ rights, that the continent would be better off without us. If we have any ambitions of our own as a force for renewal, or any sense of solidarity in reforming a European project whose negative elements we partly created, we cannot accept that.“Fix Britain instead” was the slogan for a second referendum suggested by Tom Kibasi, the head of the IPPR thinktank. Its Prosperity and Justice inquiry last year drew together a set of realities that would be enough to make anybody angry: pathetic wage growth, housing inequality, income inequality, wealth inequality, high household debt, weak government investment, poor research and development, and a tax system that doesn’t meet the needs of public services or the demands of social justice. None of this was driven by EU membership. All of it is more pressing, more meaningful and more within our grasp than any change to our relationship with the EU, which we have seen not just de-prioritise but obliterate the national agenda.There is some overlap between the third argument – let’s move on – and the first two, yet it warrants its own category, because the appetite for it is just so strong: the almost unbearable lightness of being able to say no to more of this bilge no more colonial fantasists no more throwbacks invoking fake passions about the second world war no more feckless aristocrats flapping their hands and saying, “It’s fine for that factory to close, manufacturing is so last century and besides, it would have closed anyway” no more nonsense about superiority and dominance and prowess, while trade deals unravel before they’ve even been stitched no more chancers taking crash courses in French geography, or Irish history or Chinese diplomacy in real time. Let’s just move on, and talk about things that are real. This is how a remain campaign will be fought, and this is how it will be won."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8804a07a3ebd154328539fb74cd9aac375dd2bf6/0_75_1838_1102/master/1838.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53156eab5221d57c7c916e4d9d30fe19","title":"chagos islanders britain coloniser colony","story":"At a time when Britain needs goodwill and great branding, the world was reminded this week of our nation’s shame, courtesy of the families of 2,000 people dispossessed from their Indian Ocean home in the 1960s and 70s. It’s a shame that looms large in the history of the Chagos Islands, an archipelago whose tiny size is in perfect contrast to the scale of the wrongs its people have witnessed. They are wrongs stretching back centuries, since the British formally acquired the islands from France – as part of the bigger colony of Mauritius – and forced slaves from Mozambique and Madagascar to work on British-owned coconut plantations.That original sin was compounded when, granting independence to Mauritius in the 1960s, Britain used a combination of bullying and blackmail to hive off the Chagos Islands so that they could remain colonised, leaving Britain free to do with the islands as it wanted. What Britain wanted, it turned out, was to forcibly remove the local population – sometimes referred to in official documents as “Man Fridays” – leaving the territory available for cold war-era US defence facilities. The papers documenting this sorry process were – along with those that report other state-sanctioned colonial crimes such as the murder and torture of Mau Mau insurgents in Kenya – sent to Britain and “disappeared” by the Foreign Office, to avoid scrutiny or accountability.Now that these documents have come to light – many because of legal action brought by Mau Mau survivors – Britain has continued to oppose justice for the Chagossians. The UK’s lawyers, led by solicitor general Robert Buckland, did concede that Chagossians were treated “very badly” during their removal from their home. But the islanders speak better for themselves. Liseby Elysé recounted how Britain stopped the shipment of food and medicine from Mauritius on which they relied, until they had little choice but to board a ship for Mauritius, leaving almost everything behind. Elysé was pregnant at the time, and when she arrived four days later, she lost her baby. “Conditions in the hull of the ship were bad,” she told the international court of justice (ICJ). “We were like animals and slaves in that ship.”But the Chagossians’ plight did not end there. Those who ended up in the UK more recently fell to the mercy of the “hostile environment” immigration policy in the same way as the Windrush generation. Some of the Chagossians’ descendants now have deportation to worry about in addition to their other woes. Worse still, this deportation would not be to their home islands, obviously, because Britain still prohibits that.In the meantime, the Chagos island of Diego Garcia, which became a US military base, has become a well-known case. Britain let the Americans use it for extraordinary rendition, as a hub for flights transporting terror suspects to be interrogated “off grid”, illegally tortured by the CIA, and then transferred to the now notorious detention facility at Guantánamo Bay. Between slavery, colonialism, ongoing human rights violations, the war in Iraq, the removal of documents and even the Windrush scandal, it’s hard to think of a single better example than the Chagos Islands of everything that is wrong with the legacy that the country we currently inhabit has created. Now the ICJ has said the UK must make amends. Remarkably, given that most of the former British empire was dismantled more than 50 years ago – including Mauritius, granted independence in 1968 – the world’s court has ruled Britain must finish what it started. The decolonisation of Mauritius will only be complete, the Hague-based judges said, when the Chagos Islands are returned to Mauritian rule.Britain the colonial power – as we were called during the unedifying process of attempting to defend this state of affairs in the world court – is not quite the image its leaders are trying to project just now. The irony of that was not lost on Philippe Sands – the British professor of international law representing Mauritius – who couldn’t resist quoting Boris Johnson. “No country wishes to be a colony,” Sands said in his closing remarks, before citing the former foreign secretary’s stance on Brexit. “The UK does not wish to be a colony, yet it stands before this court to defend a status as coloniser of others.”All this was watched by no fewer than 31 nations, including key European players – such as France, the Netherlands and Germany – key Commonwealth partners and former colonies, including India and members of the African Union. Not one was willing to defend the UK’s substantive position except the United States, which has an obvious vested interest in the continued operation of the military base .This decision, and what happens next, will be pored over by international lawyers for years to come. The Chagossians, who are now celebrating the unlikeliest of victories against the nation that changed the course of their lives, say they are going home. But for the rest of us, it’s a legal arrow that strikes at the heart of our delusions of grandeur. Britain is the nation that wants to be seen as an oppressed EU “colony”, while nostalgic for the status that came from dominating, oppressing and abusing others. Quite fitting then, that this week of all weeks, the empire should strike back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f5b9209e3325da478523456026451bfdbea2c82/0_102_5263_3158/master/5263.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a8270c221ea2ee856cfcceb2746de93","title":"clean brexit theresa may","story":"Nothing about Brexit means it can only happen on 29 March 2019. There is no rare alignment of the planets to make that a uniquely auspicious date for leaving the EU. Britain’s relationship with its nearest allies is not settled by astrology. The March deadline is simply a feature of the negotiating apparatus and, as the prime minister conceded in parliament yesterday, it can be moved. Leaving in April or June is still leaving.It is the psychology of letting a deadline slip that makes Theresa May’s concession so significant. If Eurosceptics were interested in orce on civil terms they would endure a short technical postponement to get it right. They would not resent the vote on a deferral that May has offered to MPs in the event that her deal is rejected. Article 50 extension has looked inevitable for weeks, if the objective is smooth passage to whatever comes next. So it is instructive that so many Brexiteers hate the idea.Their declared objection is that the public has commissioned a job and wants it done on time. But there is no such thing as finishing Brexit. Even if May’s deal forms the basis of an orderly withdrawal, it initiates more negotiations on the long-term relationship. In the best-case scenario, those talks are completed within a 21-month transition period. The dynamics of an evolving European project mean that Britain will then for the foreseeable future be loitering in Brussels ante-chambers, trying to resolve issues arising from its weird status as a former member of the club.A dirty secret in the leaver camp is that there is no “clean Brexit”, although it is a clever rhetorical trick to suggest one. The vote to leave the EU contained a desire to be rid of the whole European question. Much of the visceral appeal of Brexit was in its aura of simplification. It promised to prune back the tendrils of foreign meddling, to make a tidier, more sovereign land. It is a kind of Marie Kondo doctrine of national de-cluttering to liberate the inner joy of clean-lined Britishness. It was only remainers who fixated on the technical complexity of the task and, since they didn’t think it should be done at all, their objections were easily dismissed as bogus excuses for not getting on with the task.But Brexit is irredeemably complex. There is no tidy way to do it, and the messiest version of all is the one that the hardest Brexiters advocate – quitting without a comprehensive agreement. This is routinely called the “no deal” scenario, but that is a misnomer. Only if Britain wants to be more isolated than North Korea will there be literally no deal.In every other model there are deals: on planes landing on people and goods crossing borders on mutual recognition of standards and qualifications on extraditing villains and exchanging students on the weft and the warp of modern civilisation. The difference between a grand treaty struck under the article 50 process and multiple emergency protocols, hastily concocted under circumstances craved by the hardest Brexiters, is that in the latter case, Britain would have to step out from behind the table in Brussels and negotiate on its knees. The things that Tory backbenchers currently dislike about May’s plan (principally the Irish “backstop”) have come about as a consequence of asymmetric power. The UK has not been able to undermine the solidarity, or overcome the combined diplomatic muscle, of a 27-nation bloc. That imbalance becomes more pronounced once the article 50 period expires.Bluffing stops when the cards are face-up on the table. May appears to understand this logic. She knows that the country is poorly equipped for an overnight severance of continental ties, so why wait so long to admit it?Decrypting the prime minister’s motives is generally a waste of time. Cabinet ministers who have worked closely with May for years say they have no access to the private realm of her calculations. Senior officials doubt that there is a hidden strategic intelligence behind the eyes and describe her simply surviving each day as it comes. May has a fanatical devotion to the idea of fulfilling her duty, but that could mean avoiding national disaster or honouring the pledge to end EU membership on the date and on the terms that have been promised. The two imperatives pull in opposite directions.At the core of the paralysis is the fallacy of the One True Brexit. This is the mythical deal that avoids economic disturbance while convincing ardent leavers that their demands have been met. This cannot exist because the disruption itself – the sound of fabric tearing and glass breaking – is what many Brexiters crave. Stable transition defers the gratification of instantaneous release. But it is also in the nature of Brexit, even in its hardest form, that the moment of release is illusory. It is a process, not a destination. The article 50 timetable gives structure to the first phase but it never offered resolution. The highest point for leavers, the purest elation, was in the early hours of 24 June 2016, when the referendum result was declared. The trajectory since then was towards failure. Disappointment was coded into Brexit’s political algorithms.This matters especially in the context of calls for another referendum. The core objection is that posing the question again is an affront to leave voters, and that they would be betrayed if remain won a rematch. That is indeed a risk, but it must be balanced against the cost of capitulating to hardline Brexiters who are determined to be betrayed and to stir up public rage under any circumstances. Even if they get exactly what they say they want – total, immediate detachment from Europe – they will blame the ensuing chaos on remain-supporting ministers and civil servants for failing to make adequate preparations. Emergency deals required to end the chaos would then be denounced as capitulations to Brussels.There is no variant of the future in which Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg declare themselves satisfied with the outcome of Brexit and magnanimously seek reconciliation with its critics. Grievance is the raw material they need to fuel their politics, and Euroscepticism is the mine where they extract it. They will not shut the facility down to celebrate Britain leaving the EU. Europe will always be there on our doorstep, brazenly existing, flaunting its continentalism in our faces, and the Brexit hardliners are impatient to move on to the next phase of their betrayal.That’s why they find the thought of delaying the departure date so unbearable. Adjusting the deadline sustains the search for practical solutions. It keeps alive the idea of compromise, and that is what most offends the true spirit of Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9812327d58115e6c2ebafa8ce51a9daf8ee6b5db/0_94_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c80d73e328ba9ed07d687179dd2785bc","title":"labour vote referendum jeremy corbyn","story":"John Mann, the pro-Brexit Labour MP, says the party will lose support if it pursues the policy announced by Jeremy Corbyn, and ends up enabling a public vote on the UK’s relationship with the European Union. There are two problems with his argument. One concerns the nature of Labour’s choice, while the second concerns the polling data.The choice first. In the 2017 general election, Labour won the support of around 8 million remain voters and 4 million leave voters. Plainly, the party wishes to retain the backing of both groups. This is one reason (albeit not the only one) why the party leadership has tried to ride both horses since the election – sympathising with the concerns of voters on both sides.One consequence of this is that in almost every Labour seat – and it’s possible that we no longer need the “almost” – most Labour supporters voted remain. In these seats, the bulk of leave voters would prefer a Conservative or Ukip MP. Pro-Brexit Labour MPs cannot assume that a majority of their own party supporters share their hostility to the EU.Mid-term polls are, of course, unreliable predictors at the calmest of times and the times we are living through are far from calm. Nevertheless, the risks to Labour of alienating the pro-remain majority of its supporters are huge. In purely pragmatic terms, the party needs to keep them onside. It is not obvious that the best way to do this is to follow John Mann into the pro-Brexit ision lobby in the Commons.What, though, about the potential for Labour winning, or winning back, leave voters by taking Mann’s advice? Bluntly, these votes don’t exist – or, to be more precise, a more committed pro-Brexit stance would actually alienate more leave voters than it would attract.Again, great caution must be taken with hypothetical polls in such a fluid political context. But if I were Mann I would want some evidence that his Brexit policy would be more popular than a pro-remain stance. Not only does that evidence simply not exist the data we have suggests precisely the opposite.• Peter Kellner is a former president of YouGov"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89ea7161ad492e9c547c5c11df6808eb0e7575ba/0_0_941_571/master/941.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d83f02673f916db4be5a13fca51eecae 1370w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of smooth","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘smooth’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘smooth’.Share your photos of what smooth means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 27 February at 10am.

It also partly explains the crash in the song thrush population, which relies on this type of worm to feed its young in the spring.Researchers asked farmers to dig pits in their fields and count the number of worms of each type they found. The average field had nine per spadeful, but the best fields with healthy soil had three times that number.

Road traffic is a leading source.On Tuesday the mayor of London issued a high pollution alert for the capital as people across the UK basked in the unseasonably warm February weather. It was the first alert since last July, towards the end of a long heatwave and dry spell.Traffic and other emissions from local sources were mainly to blame for this week’s dirty air, with only light winds to disperse them and air from the continent bringing further pollutants.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said high levels of particulate matter in the air were also recorded in the past few days in the East and West Midlands. Other regions were also expected to experience localised pollution in hotspots, carrying on at least into Wednesday.The new map of nitrogen dioxide pollution limit breaches for recent years shows that Earl’s Court station in London was worst overall, with a recording of 129.5 micrograms per cubic metre, compared with the 40μgm3 limit set out in the government’s air quality objectives.A monitoring station near the Ikea store in Brent, north London, recorded levels slightly above 100μgm3 in 2016, while Kensington High Street, Euston Road and Strand in central London were all above 90μgm3 in 2017.Air near Neville Street in Leeds was found to be just under the 100μgm3 level, closely followed by two locations in Hickleton, Doncaster. Other hotspots included Brighton, Sheffield and Coventry, where the levels on Holyhead Road were found to be near twice the advised limit, at about 76μgm3 in 2016.Friends of the Earth, which mapped the sites and collated the data, said it was further evidence of the dire air quality across the country as a result of burgeoning traffic emissions and poor government controls on emissions sources. The group called for tougher action by ministers.Simon Bowens, a clean air campaigner at FoE, said: “It’s unforgivable that across the UK there are nearly 2,000 locations over air quality limits, leaving millions of us breathing dangerously polluted air. The government needs to step up and do more to help deal with this air pollution crisis. They can’t just carry on leaving the difficult decisions with local authorities, many of which are severely under-resourced.”He said the map showed that air pollution was not just a problem for big cities. “Unacceptably toxic air can be found across much of the UK, even in smaller towns,” he said. “It is harming the health of people across the country and is especially bad for young children whose lungs are still developing.”Air pollution is known to shorten lives and reduce the quality of life for tens of thousands of people, and in recent studies it has also been linked to health problems from dementia to heart disease and miscarriage. Children are most at risk: exposure to air pollution when young can have lifelong effects as it can stunt the lungs and affect intelligence.A fresh inquest into the death of Ella Kissi-Debrah, a nine-year-old from south London, is expected to be asked to consider whether her death six years ago from an asthma-related seizure could have been linked to high levels of air pollution.The data used for the map was taken from the most recent annual air quality status reports that have been submitted to government, most of them from last year, with the results adjusted for distance and other factors."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76a688747bfa97fada74dbee6dd14285e77bfce5/0_473_6255_3753/master/6255.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=599fcc031625ec361db3b4beed2eb4e6","title":"rivers of waste pakistans recyclers go out on patrol in pictures","story":"Every year Pakistan produces around 20m tonnes of rubbish, with around half of it is burned or thrown into rivers, causing pollution, disease and flooding.

The latest swimwear, from high-tech trunks to whimsical costumes, makes it easier than ever to take the plungeNationwide, there is a boom in wild swimming. Even the fashion pack, rarely ones to embrace the great outdoors, have got involved. Anne-Marie Curtis, editor-in-chief of Elle, swims regularly at the Kenwood Ladies’ Pond on Hampstead Heath in London, as does designer Louise Gray.Four years ago, printmaker Katherine Anteney entered a triathlon. While training, she remembered how good swimming felt – the peace and the adrenaline, the pleasure of spreading your fingers wide in cool water or kicking your legs in a firm breaststroke. She began visiting lakes regularly. “At first I wore a wetsuit, but ditched that pretty quickly as it felt like it kept me removed from the water.”I’ve swum in the ladies’ pond every week, all year round, for three years. My swimming partner, Sarah Regh, whom I met in the pond during my first ever visit, is an expert in unusual swimwear. Her current costume is covered in a bold shark print. “It’s from Batoko and is made from recycled materials,” she says. Her top tip is flip-flops for the dash from changing hut to water’s edge. “I would pick flip-flops over hat, gloves and swimsuit, any day they are key to warming up quickly. They provide vital insulation between the ground and my body and allow me to focus on getting dry.”Today, Anteney’s favourite swimming spot is the river Test in Southampton. Even in the winter, she will swim a handful of times a month, and the local train now greets her and her swimming partner Pam with a hoot. “Where we get changed is called the Slab. It’s a concrete culvert right next to the tracks on the mainline to Salisbury. We always get a honk and a wave. Those poor fellas have seen our bare bums too many times.”Anteney advises swimming with a companion for camaraderie and motivation. “We swim upstream heads up and chatting, and then back with head-down crawl. In the winter, we wear woolly hats and I keep my glasses on, because then I have an excuse not to put my face in.” Occasionally, they go in the dark with head torches. She would advise investing in neoprene shoes for warmth. “I hate getting mud on my feet,” she says. “Earplugs help keep you warmer but they mean you can’t do much chatting, so I’ve stopped wearing them. I have learned the importance of getting warm quickly afterwards and anticipating the afterdrop (where your core temp carries on dropping after you get out). I couldn’t live without my Dryrobe.” This combines a windproof outer shell with a synthetic lambswool lining.If the thought of plunging into the cold – and open water often is cold, even in the warmer weather – in just a swimming costume fills you with horror, a wetsuit is always an option. Consider the thickness carefully, says consultant Charlotte Goodhart, who swims in the West Reservoir at Manor House, north London. “My advice would be to wear a wetsuit of at least 2mm thickness – the water might not feel that cold but you’ll gradually get quite chilly – though gloves and socks aren’t as necessary.”Ben Alden-Falcone is a sea man. He swims regularly along the Kent coast, in particular in the Walpole Bay Tidal Pool in Margate. Three years ago, he swam the Channel as part of a relay of three. “I definitely got the short straw starting first in the pitch black of a very cold early morning. Then, on my next hour stretch as the sun came up, plume upon plume of red jellyfish surfaced. You couldn’t swim round them – there were thousands. I got stung to bits – it looked like I had been whipped.”Unlike Goodhart, he still wouldn’t recommend a wetsuit: “For me, a wetsuit kills a key joy of cold-water swimming – the freedom. I want to feel the water, even if a twig or bit of seaweed makes me jump occasionally.” He wears tight swimming shorts instead. And goose fat, for the Channel, surely? “I think the goose fat is a bit of a rumour we had Vaseline to stop chafing.” He’s a fan of ear plugs, but says the best preparation is temperature-checking. “My No 1 tip is always acclimatise to the water temperature (especially if you don’t go regularly) by dipping your feet into the water for a couple of minutes first. This will cool your body temperature and reduce risk of a shock to the heart.”Before you grab your goggles, consider your swimming aims, says Anteney. “The last thing it’s about is exercise,” she says. “It’s about being in the water and feeling it all around you. Being at eye level with nature. An early-morning swim before work makes the rest of the day manageable. It keeps me sane – even though everyone else thinks we are insane.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The latter will likely prove a hit on the red carpet – where the label regularly appears – thanks to it drawing the fine line between empowerment and sensuality. Meanwhile, the masculine military-style wool coats that opened the show in grey, white and black, showed that it wasn’t just about clothes for a special occasion.Staged in a giant mirrored box erected in the Fontaine du Trocadero against the glittering backdrop of the Eiffel Tower, Vaccarello created something of a light show of his own. Inside, a lightrod installation behind two-way mirrored glass was on such a large scale that it rivalled the lights of the famous landmark outside.The second part of the show, in which models walk in UV light on the other side of the giant screens did, however, serve more than a creative purpose. Under an ultraviolet lens, the new line of flouro shoes that the brand is introducing for next season seemed to walk themselves, making the footwear the most memorable takeaway from the collection.It was a savvy move given Vaccarello’s form for creating the most lusted after shoes of seasons past. The slouchy, thigh-high boots covered in 3,000 rhinestones on each foot, which he designed in 2017 and which went viral after Rihanna wore them, were on waiting lists around the world despite their $10,000 (£7,545) price tag. Saint Laurent will be hoping that they help them make their revenue target of €2bn by 2022, which CEO Francesca Bellettini said last November they were on track to do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/024c71f10261bea1211d5639fae951388fc989a9/126_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=048a973c72b63b9a539cae86a52a7feb","title":"we felt a huge responsibility behind the landmark apollo 11 documentary","story":"To create the year’s first must-see documentary, director Todd Douglas Miller worked with Nasa to restore fascinating unseen footage from 1969A man sips a beer, eyeing the horizon from a Florida parking lot. Nasa techs sit in a lobby as headlines blare of Ted Kennedy’s car crash in Chappaquiddick. They’re two of the many striking details – ordinary, recognizable moments amid one of humankind’s most extraordinary achievements – restored to full vitality in Apollo 11, an all-primary source documentary, meticulously restored. The 93-minute documentary, released for a limited time in the US on IMAX before a wider release, and to be shown in museums later this year, captures the first moon mission and its spectators in the visceral, wide-lens color of cinema epics – an achievement in historical preservation that hinged on the discovery of long-unopened boxes idling in archives.Last month, the film premiered to enthused acclaim at Sundance, following on from a banner year for documentaries from the recently Oscar-anointed Free Solo to fellow box office hits RBG, Three Identical Strangers and Won’t You Be My Neighbor. Apollo 11 is set to continue the trend but it is distinguished, however, by its stark commitment to the historical record: the film is made up entirely of restored footage and audio from the historic 11 mission in July 1969.It’s a far cry from three years ago, when much of the record from Apollo 11 remained analog or boxed away. At the time, director Todd Douglas Miller, fresh off The Last Steps, a short about Apollo 17, wasn’t looking to e back into the heavily mythologized missions to the moon. When Stephen Slater, a Britain-based independent archivist who has peerlessly synced existing 16mm Mission Control footage with separate audio recordings, approached Miller about creating a project to honor Apollo 11’s 50th anniversary this year, Miller balked. “I was like, ‘No. Not happening. I’m all spaced out right now’,” he said to the . “But it became addictive.”Miller and his team, including producing partner Tom Petersen, began with Apollo 11 footage they and Slater had already gathered for other projects. Between other work, the team and post-production office Final Frame tinkered with it, “just kind of constructing it with nothing more than, ‘Could we do this?’ We knew it was basically going to be an art film, but could we make it something that would be compelling?” Miller said of this period in late 2016.The answer, with significant help from Nasa and the National Archives, was a resounding yes, especially once Miller’s request for all Apollo 11 archival material unearthed long-forgotten, large format, 70mm footage that captured the launch day in Hollywood-level rich detail.“The reels had been sitting there untouched, labeled ‘Apollo 11’ with some dates but nobody even knew what was on them,” said Miller of the discovery. Dan Rooney, the supervisory archivist for the National Archives’ Motion Picture, Sound, and Video branch knew of the existence of 65mm and 70mm Apollo-related footage – leftovers from Nasa promotional videos and a 1972 movie called Moonwalk One, shot in the same level of wide detail as 60s epics like Cleopatra – but didn’t know what they held.Some of the treasures, beautifully caught: backroom footage of Nasa staff preparing a nervous yet genial Neil Armstrong in his space suit a drowsy woman atop an old car, parked early to watch lift-off the fiery trail of Apollo 11 reflected in a woman’s oversize, mod shades.Miller said the process quickly snowballed into a historical preservation project to transfer all the large format, 16mm and 35mm film into digital. “The way to do it is to do it all. If you’re going to do one, you might as well do it all,” he said. In order to work around the clock, the team set up shop at a post-production studio, Final Frame, in New York City, and enlisted climate-control vans to safely transport the archival film back and forth from DC. “We just felt an immense responsibility to curate all the materials and make sure that they of course got back to their homes in a timely fashion,” Miller said.Miller worked with Nasa’s chief historian, Bill Barry, as well as Rooney and volunteers who contributed their own archival efforts as word of the ambitious project spread through the space enthusiast community.“It felt like kind of a passing of a baton,” said Miller. “It was a real group effort to preserve materials that they had worked on decades ago.”Ultimately, Miller and his team sifted through material ning nine days, including over 11,000 hours of previously uncatalogued audio provided from Nasa’s troves. Paring down that real-time journey – every audio and video snippet, often overlapping, from the Apollo 11 mission – into a coherent, well-paced feature feels intimidating in retrospect, Miller said. At the time, it was immersive work. “We all felt just a huge responsibility to get it right,” he said, recognizing that “our work was informing the historical record itself”.For example, as a federal agency, Nasa has long relied on volunteers in its preservation efforts most of the existing transcriptions were old volunteer copies. Miller’s cataloguing helped correct discrepancies. “Really the proudest moment for me in working on the film was being able to just contribute in a very scientific way — ‘this guy didn’t say that, it was this guy’, or, ‘that didn’t take 12 seconds, it took 13 seconds’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud. I worked on this film to tell my story and hoped that it would resonate with people. To be nominated for this award is the highest recognition.”The film was produced by Simon Chinn and Jonathan Chinn of Lightbox (collaborator on the Whitney Houston documentary Whitney).

When he was injured in December, City suffered two of their four league defeats, at home to Crystal Palace and at Leicester. Laporte, meanwhile, is City’s best defender.Each has a muscle injury picked up in Sunday’s Carabao Cup final win over Chelsea and Guardiola said: “We were already without John Stones and Gabriel Jesus. Now it’s Dinho and Aymer. Hopefully after the international break they will return. I think John and Gabriel are coming back soon. The other two, hopefully the Swansea game, or after the international break.”The first match after the break is at Fulham on 30 March. In the meantime City face West Ham, Bournemouth and Watford in the league, and play the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Schalke, plus an FA Cup quarter-final at Swansea.Regarding who might be able to replace Fernandinho as the holding player Guardiola said: “Danilo can play there, we can play Ilkay Gündogan, Fabian Delph and I think Oleks Zinchenko can play in that position, too. So we can play with two players. Kevin De Bruyne can play there. We’re going to find the right decision that hopefully works. Dani played for Santos in that position, so he knows a little bit.”The manager has told his players he will not tolerate any attempt to find pretexts for failure in the remaining 11 games of City’s title defence. “I don’t want to see excuses about tiredness, fixtures, schedules or how many games,” Guardiola said as he prepared for Wednesday’s home game against West Ham.“That is nothing. When you have the dream to fight until the end, to retain the title, the power and the energy to give you that, it is higher than any excuses you can find.“I want to see the desire that we really want to win this title.

Leicester’s manager ran the rule over his new charges as they secured their first home win since Boxing Day thanks to goals by Demarai Gray and Jamie Vardy.Davy Pröpper pulled one back but, if Leicester are looking up again, Brighton cannot be comfortable about being only three points above Southampton, who occupy 18th place.While it would be easy to claim Leicester were inspired by Rodgers’s presence, gifts from Brighton were a major factor. Chris Hughton’s side started limply and, after rallying, finished badly, with Glen Murray guilty of two uncharacteristic misses.Still, there is no doubt the arrival of Rodgers has raised the mood at Leicester. He watched from the directors’ box from where he beamed and waved when given a rapturous greeting from the crowd before the kick-off.Apparently the players are similarly enthused by his appointment. “He came into the dressing room after the game and he was very positive,” said Mike Stowell, who, along with Adam Sadler, was in temporary charge for this match. “The lads were in awe listening to him,” Stowell continued. “He said: ‘I’ve only left Celtic to come here for one reason and that’s to work with this group of players.’ That speaks volumes for this young group.”Harry Maguire said: “It’s an exciting time for the club. We all know his profile and what he’s done. We’re all looking forward to working with him. Celtic are a massive club, so it shows how big Leicester are getting and our ambitions.”Leicester’s ambition before taking on Brighton was to end a series of four straight defeats. Having spoken of his desire to create a “really aggressive” side, Rodgers must have appreciated the way the hosts got stuck in. Then again, they could hardly have asked for more obliging visitors, as Brighton began with a timidity that showed why they are among the Premier League’s worst travellers, without an away win since a narrow victory at Huddersfield in early December.Scoring the opening goal, which Leicester repeatedly failed to do under Puel, was an ideal way to greet a new dawn. Vardy, one of the player’s hoping to benefit most from Puel’s departure, had a chance to land the first blow when James Maddison pulled the ball back to him in the fifth minute but Shane Duffy threw himself in front of the striker’s shot from the edge of the six-yard box.Leicester were not denied, merely delayed. Five minutes later they made the breakthrough thanks to Gray. Hughton must have been aghast at how feebly his team defended after Harvey Barnes dispossessed Anthony Knockaert near halfway. Youri Tielemans ran free from midfield before slipping a pass through to Gray, who was free to fire low into the net from 15 yards.He nearly doubled his tally four minutes later after Barnes again made gains down the left. Mat Ryan got down well to save.As Brighton pulled themselves together, Leicester became a little dishevelled. Kasper Schmeichel made two important saves, first from Pascal Gross and then an excellent one-handed stop to thwart Knockaert.Leicester should have been punished early in the second half when Maddison was caught in possession but, after a lovely move involving Knockaert and a back‑heeled pass by Gross, Murray lifted the ball over from eight yards. Worse, Gross suffered a hamstring injury when performing his nifty tee-up.Moments later Leicester eased their anxiety with a classy goal. Advancing nimbly from midfield they cut through Brighton, Vardy applying the finish by running on to a clever pass by Maddison and ramming the ball past Ryan from 10 yards.Leicester were not comfortable for long. Three minutes later Pröpper cut their lead in half, firing low into the net from edge of the box after Knockaert’s cross from the right was deflected into his path by Ben Chilwell.Barnes had a brilliant game on the left wing but missed two decent chances on the counterattack. Brighton’s best chance to equalise fell to Murray in the 87th minute but the normally trusty striker again misfired, blasting wide from seven yards.“At the moment we’re not putting away opportunities and so we have to make sure we’re not conceding,” Hughton said. “Those small margins are not going for us at the moment and it’s only us that can do something about it.”Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/186e3c893a7dc0cc7ff381fefd36304758a497f5/0_0_2452_1471/master/2452.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7be3e65be9119b1223d1504061fd1a15","title":"liverpool jurgen klopp premier league title race","story":"Jürgen Klopp has said this season’s title challenge is the first of many for Liverpool and his players deserve more credit for the form that has taken them top of the Premier League.The manager believes his team’s recent performances have been unfairly compared with those of other title contenders, saying hopes are magnified by Anfield’s craving for a first league championship since 1990. “No plant grows as quick as expectations here,” said Klopp, whose side hold a one-point lead over Manchester City going into Wednesday’s home game against Watford.Liverpool have drawn three of their last four league matches and Klopp himself expressed disappointment with Sunday’s stalemate at an injury-hit Manchester United. But title pursuits rarely run smooth, insisted Klopp, who believes the experience will benefit everyone at Anfield regardless of how the campaign finishes.“One generation has to break through, to make it happen, and then for the rest it will be easier. It would be nice if we could be that. The development of this team is unbelievable. Not that I praise myself or whatever, but it is unbelievable. We played three finals. I know in the world outside it looks like finals are nice, all perfect, then you don’t win and nobody thinks about it, but I don’t know a lot of teams that have been in three finals in the last three years. We improve constantly in the table.Klopp maintained he is “happy with a lot of moments” in this calendar year and the scrutiny placed on Liverpool is more intense than that on their title rivals. He added: “It’s like you get an eye problem when you have to watch our football now compared to when we played such wonderful football a few weeks ago. Sorry for that disappointment. It is the job to do.“Do other teams perform constantly? They don’t. Sometimes they have the result but we don’t look at them in detail, we just see they are winning. You only have this obsessed look on our football. Yes, there were moments when I wish we would fly a bit more but you don’t fly because you want to fly. You fly because you work for it.“I know I didn’t look like I enjoyed the second half at United but that’s how it is – it’s hard work. If the mood drops a little I understand it is my job to kick a few asses. Then after the game it’s over and we go again. Why is it such a problem for us to win 1-0? When we win 1-0 we have to explain why we don’t fly or score like last year. If we draw we have to explain why we don’t win 1-0. Something is always wrong and that is a bit of a problem, not for us internally, but that makes things not easy to enjoy sometimes.”Jordan Henderson was on the receiving end of Klopp’s anger on Sunday for not shaking his manager’s hand when substituted. “It was a pure misunderstanding,” Klopp said.Roberto Firmino has an outside chance of playing against Watford, despite leaving Old Trafford on crutches with an ankle injury. Scans revealed no serious damage and the striker has “a big chance” of facing Everton on Sunday, according to his manager."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/890c96de7094fe5495dacd350984cf18c3e0e8c2/0_128_3441_2065/master/3441.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96c0cc5aa5483a0219c96da44821b9ee","title":"newcastle burnley premier league match report","story":"Much more of this and Newcastle will soon be fronting an advertising campaign promoting the restorative powers of winter breaks in southern Spain.Annual trips to Rafael Benítez’s preferred bolthole near Alicante certainly seem to help immunise the Tyneside club against relegation. After in effect securing their Premier League status courtesy of three straight wins following last year’s mini-break, Newcastle have returned from their latest visit to the Costa Blanca and promptly taken six vital points, from Huddersfield and now Burnley.While goals from Fabian Schär – with an outstanding strike – and the excellent Sean Longstaff lifted Newcastle into the sunlit uplands of 13th place they also reminded Sean Dyche that all good things must come to an end.Burnley’s manager had never previously lost a Premier League match on a Tuesday and his team arrived unbeaten in the league in 2019 and on a run of eight league games without defeat, their best top-tier run for 53 years. “Credit to Newcastle, they were better than us,” Dyche said. “They deserved to win.”Benítez was delighted by his side’s ability in the face of Burnley’s physicality. “There were a lot of positives,” said a manager whose demeanour hints he may extend a contract that expires in May. “We trained really hard in Spain and I was confident we could finish stronger. Now we have to be confident we have a project and ambition to be a top Premier League side. We can do it.”Although configured in a fluidly attacking 3-4-3 formation Newcastle started slowly. Bar one gorgeous raking diagonal pass from Longstaff – a young midfielder set to be called up to the England Under-21s before possibly joining the fast track to Gareth Southgate’s seniors – and a first-time Matt Ritchie cross that narrowly failed to find Salomón Rondón, the hosts created little of note.Or at least not until the 24th minute. With a single swipe of his foot, Schär changed the game. After collecting the ball from Javier Manquillo the central defender found himself around 30 yards out and took aim. The resultant angled shot swerved wickedly away from Tom Heaton, the visiting goalkeeper helpless as it came off the inside of a post before dropping into the net. Even Dyche seemed nonplussed.Burnley’s manager had cut a vocal, demonstrative presence in the technical area but his game plan was soon to go further awry as Longstaff scored his first senior goal. It arrived courtesy of a fabulous cross from Ritchie – outstanding at left wing-back – with which Rondón could not quite connect, leaving the ball to drop for the academy graduate from North Shields. All that remained was for Longstaff to swivel smartly before driving an angled volley into the bottom corner.As he was serenaded with “one of our own” choruses, Dyche complained about Craig Pawson’s failure to award his side a free-kick for what he saw to be a foul on Jack Cork in the buildup.With Burnley’s recently dependable defence increasingly destabilised by Miguel Almirón’s searing change of pace and the energy of the unwell Ashley Westwood much missed in their midfield, the visitors’ unbeaten run looked in severe jeopardy. Even so they could and should have reduced the deficit as half-time neared when the ball fell kindly for James Tarkowski about six yards out. Showing why he is a centre-half rather than a centre-forward, he volleyed wildly off-target.Dwight McNeil has been a key figure in Burnley’s recent renaissance but struggled here and was replaced on the left of midfield by Robbie Brady at the interval. Dyche’s players subsequently improved slightly but not sufficiently and could have fallen further behind when Heaton saved smartly from Almirón with his legs.Burnley’s manager replaced the well-marshalled Ashley Barnes with Peter Crouch but the incoming striker’s most notable achievements were to collect a booking for catching Schär on a shin and then leaving Mo Diamé with a bandaged head after accidentally elbowing him above an eye.“Some of our quality was lacking,” said Dyche, whose side are 15th and remain within touching distance of safety. “But we’ll be back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35d97c6eb7d4856635c03ce8dd17d7c5b56b3b09/262_177_4106_2464/master/4106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93c2414b541d7482c1b9ec5ec546fb33","title":"2019 womens world cup 100 days to go","story":"From match tickets and game locations to potential stars of the future and England v ScotlandIt is now only 100 days until the Women’s World Cup kicks off in France on 7 June. Preparations are advancing apace and our guide can help you navigate the tournament.Who, when and where, and other useful logistics Twenty-four teams, including England and Scotland, compete across nine cities – Paris, Reims, Valenciennes, Le Havre, Rennes, Montpellier, Nice, Grenoble and Lyon – from 7 June to 7 July. Lyon hosts the semi-finals and the final.So what about tickets? Inidual match tickets go on general sale on Thursday March 7 at 3pm. They can be purchased from Fifa and range in price from €13 to €84 per game.Why are the final stages in Lyon? Lyon houses an outstanding women’s club team, arguably Europe’s best, starring, among others, England’s Lucy Bronze. “In Paris it’s really difficult to make people come to women’s sports events,” admits Brigitte Henriques, the vice president of the French Football Federation. “And we wanted to recognise Lyon’s work. Lyon leads women’s football in the world.”Is it on television in the UK? Yes, the BBC has the rights and will cover every game via television, radio, its website or a mixture of all three.Is France safe? Terrorism is the biggest concern but the enduring anti-government Gilets Jaunes – or yellow vests- protests – could disrupt travel. The latest UK Foreign Office travel advisory states: “Terrorists are very likely to carry out attacks in France. Due to ongoing threats by Islamist terrorist groups the French government has reinforced its security measures and warned the public to be especially vigilant.” Fans can expect airport-style checks at grounds.Will the referees be any good? Standards should be much improved. The 27 referees and 48 assistants attended an extended winter training camp in Doha, Qatar, where leading officials, including Germany’s Bibiana Steinhaus, were put through their paces and fully briefed on VAR deployment.So who are the favourites? The USA, coached by the English-born Jill Ellis, are defending champions and remain strong. France, managed by Corinne Diacre, who previously impressed during a stint in charge of second-tier men’s side Clermont, should not be underestimated either. In January, France comfortably beat the USA 3-1. Germany have been in transition but retain some top players while Japan were runners-up in 2015 and winners in 2011 and the Netherlands are Euro 2017 holders. Then there’s England.How might England do? Hard to say. Under the tactically clever Mark Sampson the Lionesses finished third at Canada 2015 before reaching Euro 2017’s semi-finals. Phil Neville is now in charge and presiding over his first major tournament. Neville preaches an attractive, attacking, passing game and would ideally like to turn England into a female version of the Manchester United side he played in under Sir Alex Ferguson. In reality, his aim of winning the World Cup may entail unlocking his inner-Sampson and turning a little more pragmatic.A comprehensive 2-0 friendly home defeat to Sweden in November indicated a need for a plan B. Yet England should progress from an initial group also featuring Scotland, Japan and Argentina – not least because Argentina are surely the tournament’s weakest side. If the Lionesses will miss the injured Jordan Nobbs’s midfield talent, the WSL’s all-professional status should help England’s cause. Much may hinge on Jodie Taylor reprising her Euro 2017 golden boot-winning form.What about Scotland? Shelley Kerr’s side should, at worst, progress to the knockout stages as one of the best third-place finishers. The team have improved considerably since they were thrashed 6-0 by England at Euro 2017. Arsenal’s gifted midfielder Kim Little is the undoubted star and cannot wait to face England in their opening game in Nice on 9 June.Any dark horses? Sweden, Canada and Australia. It will be intriguing to see how Australia – and their star player Sam Kerr – do in the wake of Alen Stajcic’s sacking as coach and replacement with Ante Milicic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daf06f3312f99c278700ca3f397033479c9ac579/0_77_5720_3432/master/5720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78e56926aabb0350cafaa217a56b8c89","title":"guardian supporters future journalism","story":"By opting for a reader-funded business model, we rely on readers to support our groundbreaking independent journalism.

An extension beyond the end of June would involve the UK taking part in the European parliament elections.Cabinet ministers are keen for May to use any delay to try to force a cross-party consensus.The no-deal notice said customs checks alone could cost businesses £13bn a year and that it was impossible to predict the impact of new tariffs. It said this was partly because the government’s communications to businesses and iniduals about the need to prepare for no deal had not been effective.It said small- to medium-sized businesses were not making basic preparations despite government advice to do so. Only 40,000 of 240,000 businesses that had no experience of customs or tariffs had registered for an economic operator registration and identification number.The government said that while it might wave hauliers through British ports, “they would be stopped if taking goods into France without the right paperwork”. This amounts to the most robust rebuttal yet of Brexiter claims that there would be no delays because the British would be taking a loose approach to checks and controls.Evidence suggested the public had not been heeding no-deal warnings either, with no “noticeable behaviour change” witnessed on a “significant scale” over the need to renew passports, and get international driving permits and green cards for insurance for driving in the EU, it said.“This would be compounded by the challenges of even modest reductions in flow at the border.”It added: “Overall, the cumulative impact from a no-deal scenario is expected to be more severe in Northern Ireland than in Great Britain, and to last for longer.”This was because of expected disruption in the “closely interwoven supply chains and increasing costs that would affect the viability of many businesses across Northern Ireland. There is a risk that businesses in Northern Ireland will not have sufficient time to prepare. This could result in business failure.”It said fewer than one in 10 items would be affected by delays on the channel crossings but, because of the timing of a potential no-deal Brexit, supplies of fresh fruit and vegetables could be hit hardest.“In the absence of other action from government, some food prices are likely to increase, and there is a risk that consumer behaviour could exacerbate, or create, shortages in this scenario,” it said.The government revealed there were significant delays to critical projects being undertaken in preparation for no deal.The document confirmed that the Treasury had made more than £4bn available for no-deal planning, £2bn of which was allocated in December to support preparations for the 2019-20 financial year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e99ef253904f69427a49e2406da29ac796c3606/0_533_2972_1783/master/2972.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43af6c5fb0ca0893ee2c0686ebf7ba0d","title":"government to launch uk food insecurity index","story":"Exclusive: Campaigners hail move to gauge number of households struggling to put food on the tableThe government is to introduce an official measure of how often low-income families across the UK skip meals or go hungry because they cannot afford to buy enough food, the  can reveal.A national index of food insecurity is to be incorporated into an established UK-wide annual survey run by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) that monitors household incomes and living standards.Campaigners, who have been calling for the measure for three years, said the move was “a massive step forward” that would provide authoritative evidence of the extent and causes of hunger in the UK. They say food insecurity is strongly linked to poverty caused by austerity and welfare cuts and is driving widening health inequality.Food insecurity is generally defined as experiencing hunger, the inability to secure food of sufficient quality and quantity to enable good health and participation in society, and cutting down on food because of a lack of money.The decision, which took campaigners by surprise, was revealed at an informal meeting on Tuesday attended by the DWP, the Office for National Statistics, Public Health England and the Scottish and Welsh governments, as well as a number of food poverty charities.Ministers have for years resisted calls to bring England into line with the US and Canada by measuring food insecurity. Critics said this was to avoid shedding unwanted light on the impact of welfare policy and the public health consequences of being unable to eat regularly or healthily.The new measures closely reflect those called for in a private member’s bill being piloted through the Commons by Labour MP Emma Lewell-Buck. She welcomed the move but said urgent action to address the causes of hunger was now needed.“It is a real pity that it has taken this long to be enacted, as every single day that has passed has been a day that another person has gone hungry. This positive step forward should not be used as an excuse for government inaction whilst this important data is being gathered,” said Lewell-Buck.The most recent best estimate of UK food insecurity, published by the Food Foundation in 2016 using UN data, suggested that in 2014 more than 8 million people lived in households that struggled to put food on the table, with more than half regularly going a whole day without eating.The DWP will add 10 questions about food buying and eating habits to its annual Family Resources Survey, which will be sent to 20,000 UK households in April. The data will be reported publicly in March 2021. Experts say the findings will help refine understanding of what drives hunger and food insecurity.The questions, which are based on US measures of food insecurity, will ask whether and how often households skipped meals, were unable to afford healthy food and went hungry or lost weight because they did not have enough money to buy sufficient food.The change of direction on measuring food insecurity comes just weeks after Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, conceded that the rollout of universal credit had contributed to an increase in food bank use, reversing previous ministerial claims that the two were not linked.The DWP said: “We always ensure we use the best possible evidence base for making policy. Building a better understanding of household food needs will help us to ensure we’re targeting support to those who need it most, so we’ve worked closely with stakeholders to develop tools to help us best collect this information.”Anna Taylor, the executive director of the Food Foundation thinktank, said: “We’ve known for too long now that a disturbing number of people in the UK don’t have access to enough nutritious food, but our knowledge has been too patchy to identify real solutions. In the fifth-richest economy in the world, that’s a social justice disaster.”Niall Cooper, the director of Church Action on Poverty and chair of End Hunger UK, said: “It was over three years ago that End Hunger UK coalition members first called on the government to ‘count the hungry’. So we’re delighted, three years later, that food insecurity levels are finally going to be measured regularly.”A Food Foundation study last year found almost 4 million children in the UK lived in households that would struggle to afford to buy enough fruit, vegetables, fish and other healthy foods to meet official nutrition guidelines."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de7318cb290a1b0fe86390cb1cf2d17d67bb1f87/0_1012_5144_3086/master/5144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f366d7b335506c148c589d0e723f13a8","title":"simon godwin british director us theatre","story":"In his new role as artistic director of the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington DC, the National Theatre and RSC star talks about swapping Brexit for TrumpAs Donald Trump surged towards a jaw-dropping election victory in late 2016, scholar Stephen Greenblatt wrote in the New York Times: “In the early 1590s, Shakespeare sat down to write a play that addressed a problem: How could a great country wind up being governed by a sociopath?”The play was Richard III, currently being performed just a mile from the White House by the Shakespeare Theatre Company. Its resonances are hard to miss for audiences in Washington, a liberal bastion that some liken to city under occupation during the Donald Trump presidency.The theatre company’s own monarch is about to step down. Artistic director Michael Kahn retires at the end of the season after 33 years. His successor is Simon Godwin who, having earned plaudits at the UK’s National Theatre and Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), now swaps Brexit Britain for Trump’s Washington. Nowhere is the collision of politics and art more acute.“To think about putting on Shakespeare in the city of power is so exciting because so many of his plays are about rhetoric and the law and language and persuasion and high stakes,” Godwin, 40, says in an interview with the  at the company’s Sidney Harman Hall.“I’m conscious that it’s a very charged and very emotional time and it’s a time that is volatile. I think that theatre can often either benefit or suffer from those moments, partly because you do become a barometer for certain energies and ideas and if you misstep those it’s perilous but, if you exquisitely capture the moment, theatre becomes more charged than ever.”Godwin, whose father David Godwin is a literary agent, grew up in St Albans, studied at Cambridge and exudes a quirky English self-confidence. His first season at the helm will be a suitably Anglo-American affair. There is Everybody (a retelling of the 15th-century morality play Everyman) by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, a new version of Peter Pan by Lauren Gunderson that puts Wendy centre stage as a proto-scientist, a reimagining of Godwin’s acclaimed production of Timon of Athens starring Kathryn Hunter, The Amen Corner by James Baldwin (back in the spotlight after his novel, If Beale Street Could Talk, was adapted for the big screen), Emma Rice’s play with music Romantics Anonymous and Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing.“I think what people are hungry for here is generosity of spirit,” he suggests. “They’re happy to go to the darkness so long as you also bring them into the light. But look, the comparison that I used when I was sharing the programme with people is that I am running a very successful restaurant in London, I’m about to open a new restaurant in Washington, some of the dishes people will enjoy and some of them, I will discover, they don’t like at all.” Back in Britain, Shipwreck, a History Play About 2017 by Anne Washburn, brimming with debate about the meaning of Trump and Trumpism, has just opened at the Almeida Theatre in London, prompting theatre critic Ben Brantley to wonder “why does this New Yorker have to cross an ocean to see what promises to be this season’s most exciting American play?” Despite his new company’s close proximity to the White House, Godwin has no immediate plans to tackle the subject of this peculiar presidency head on.“I think I need to understand a little bit about what Trump represents in people’s imaginations so that I can be in dialogue with that rather than simply reproduce him. What forces does he represent, what forces is he the emblem of and how do people feel about that and how to put that in a debate? Because after all, what makes Shakespeare great is that the balance of argument in his plays is so finely matched. That’s why they’re an intellectual workout and I think that’s why audiences in Washington have enjoyed them so much.”Don’t expect glib Trump-bashing screeds designed to preach to the Washington converted. “The great thing about Shakespeare is we didn’t know what his politics were. You could find examples of him taking one view and then in another play really a very different one. So I feel that what we should be doing is doing shows that lots of different sides can feel heard within rather than being partisan or easily caught in one position or another. For me, the Shakespeare values that are there are things like empathy, generosity of spirit, attention to detail, the power of language, the ability of art to rekindle a love of life. And so he’s political and yet he’s beyond politics.”Shakespeare has a long and winding history in America. During the civil war, a production of Julius Caesar in New York starred John Wilkes Booth and his two brothers to raise funds for a Shakespeare statue in Central Park. The following year, at Ford’s Theatre in Washington, Booth assassinated Abraham Lincoln. As the actor fled into hiding, he quoted from Macbeth in the last words of his diary: “‘I must fight the course.’ ’Tis all that’s left in me.” Washington is also home to the Folger Shakespeare Library, which contains the world’s biggest Shakespeare collection.What is Godwin, who starts in September, expecting on this side of the Atlantic? “Probably there’s an approach that is fresher and that’s freer from history and from any kind of habit. There’s Shakespeare to be discovered here and actually the Brits are learning from the Americans about classics because there’s such freedom. Zesty, free thinking about Shakespeare is devoutly to be wished. Having said that, what I am most excited about is bringing some of the rigour that I’ve grown up with in terms of the language, the meaning, the nuance, and meeting a fresh curiosity about what Shakespeare means now, which this country so vividly asks, and bringing them together.”Godwin’s inclusion of Baldwin and Jacobs-Jenkins suggest a desire to explore race relations at this most sensitive of times. “People have mentioned to me in Washington that things move very fast here, that the news cycle and the dialogue about race and gender and power and appropriateness and meaning are all in a very quick and incendiary relationship.“Perhaps in England there is Brexit, but even that seems be rather like a long and boring play as we’re sort of chugging along, and stuff happens yet we’re all so exhausted by it we just wish it would finish, whereas you can’t afford to be asleep on your post in America, it seems.”He adds: “And yet I also have to maintain enormous modesty in terms of going, ‘What does something mean? What is appropriate? What is the relationship? How does the relationship differ in terms of the British relationship with race and the American relationship with race.“I should be very much a learner about that and find people that I can engage with and indeed artists and writers and actors and directors and academics who are African American, who I can actually say maybe the best thing is if you make work here and speak and share your feelings as much as me trying to make work for you. I need to clear out and give them the space and the power to speak, the agency to tell the stories that are going to count.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68bd77db04ea7282bd4f48f772b96bf815b4ac1d/0_0_6239_4171/master/6239.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=00a9cae7f2373e98116f9fe15cae4fd6 2020w","title":"digital minimalism how do you konmari a 10 year text message history","story":"Our hard drives are full of all kinds of clutter, but you can’t hold those files in your hands to see if they spark joyLeaving a long-term relationship, you find yourself standing on the precipice of a life yet unlived all of a sudden the accumulated trinkets and tchotchkes of​ your life together exist only to mock you in your unspoken grief. There’s no better time to get into getting rid of stuff.After she emptied our house of all ​that she wanted, I emptied it a second time, of everything that we had grown to want together. I embraced the spartan wisdom of Marie Kondo’s The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up – the self-help manual de rigueur for people who want to want less. Like a barren arctic island basking in my daily hour of sunlight, I proudly embraced an aesthetic of Scandinavian noir-chic, telling anyone within earshot that the drab palette and multiple timber-veneer Arkelstorp side tables were the trappings of a new and more mature me, a me that was as comfortable owning six oversized beige floor lamps and playing at underwear origami as I was being alone.A brutalist of the inner world, Kondo imagines a life made better for being purposeful in its scantness – a message that does not bode well for the abode of one married to their clutter, but I latch on to her philosophy hook, line and sinker. I fold each of my socks, throw away projects that sit half finished, and appraise the emotional bond I share with my cutlery. I begin to feel like maybe it’s actually working. Minimalism feels like a scam until you’re in on it, and isn’t that what scams are all about now?But for all the physical detritus in our orbit, what exists on our computers is vaster and more vague a digital footprint compressed deep. There isn’t a guidebook for emotional digital minimalism. No one tells you how to hold a file in your hand, to embrace a 100KB photograph, to evaluate whether a 10-year text-message history “sparks joy”.It’s been estimated that the trillions of electrons that make up the entire internet weigh about 50 grams, around half the weight of a pack of cards. But what about the emotional weight of keeping terabytes of photographs you took of someone while you loved them? What was the feeling of deleting them? More than anything, I felt the need to find out.We all curate ourselves on the internet, whether you’re an aspiring influencer, KonMari-ing your Twitter followers, or demanding the “right to be forgotten”. But we are increasingly sold the unassailable notion that behind the scenes no such maintenance is required. The cloud is infinite, a fluffy Sunday-school afterlife for our digital debris. Google promises me more space than I could once even fathom, Dropbox will allocate me huge tracts of land on their digital acreage, and Apple pinky-swears that every blurry photo of a dog, cloud or my pink, bared arse will remain safe forever, as long as I cough up to keep their labyrinthine server compound spinning.I begin a pilgrimage. Every photo ever taken, every file saved – my digital history up for appraisal. Years of work and pleasure have become a formless sweater, taking months to unravel, each day finding myself tugging ever tighter in the cold. What at the start is a careful evaluation, trying to consider each file as I had my teaspoons and shower gel, grows increasingly fast and unfeeling. In one marathon session, equipment tests and engagement parties alike flick past in seconds, as I pick out the smattering of photos deemed worthy, before transferring the rest into a growing folder of refuse.I tell all my friends about this journey, and their responses vary wildly. Some find my task Sisyphean but fascinating. Others do not understand, and openly revel in the automaticity of the cloud. Not making decisions, they say, is how they find the time to make other, more important decisions. Mostly they tell me that they wouldn’t have the time, with the kind of look that betrays their concern that I do.One friend tells me of how once, in the days before Facebook, she lost a hard drive containing the entire photographic history of her and an ex how it felt like a cleaving, a blade cutting clean through tender flesh. This sort of thing could never happen nowadays, she muses, and I think of all that data I have no control over. Somewhere out there, pinging off a distant cloud, is the first time I met you, the first time I blurted out, “I love you”, the first time you saw my tits. Somewhere too is the last thing you ever said to me, preserved until the end of time, or until the ad revenue runs dry.I realise too, as the months drag on, that this process is framing and changing how I interact with the content that I create and curate now. Meals are prepared and eaten unphotographed. Conversations carry on with no one sneaking their phones for posterity. I watch sunsets fade into darkness until the night chill sends me indoors, my phone unthinkingly left atop one of my five Arkelstorps. My memory has never been good, but I make more room in my head for moments that feel significant, and the moments I do share with people are more valuable in turn.One day I realise there are no more files to sort through, no more junk data, and all that’s left is one big folder full of all those split-second decisions. I’m back at the beginning, trying to quantify what this means, what this feels like. The boxes have slowly emptied out of the rental we once shared, the last of her self-help books ready to take on a new life outside of this ghost house, and yet this folder lingers, like it’s waiting for me to commit. Then, on a whim, it’s time. There is no more use in deliberating, and I move to delete it.I pause, cursor hovered over the trash as though I’m holding these 50,000-odd photographs cupped in my hands. It is finally tangible. It feels like this deserves some kind of ritual, or a moment of peace. I wait to experience anything in this moment, but there’s nothing there, so I just let go.

And aside from the festival, each weekend visitors can tour a walkable collection of brew-taps and brewery-owned city-centre bars – and drink some of Britain’s best beer. Here is your essential guide.It is difficult to make an industrial railway arch unit cosy but, near Victoria station, owner Mark Welsbyhas transformed Runaway’s split-level space of pallets and trestle tables into a laid-back nook that’s ideal for lingering – despite the fact you’re drinking from plastic glasses overlooking a working brewery. There is moody lighting, board games, beer skittles, interesting music and a few subtly eccentric decorative flourishes. Eight keg taps are augmented by bottles to drink-intakeaway. Do not miss the Tropical Crush double IPA (DIPA) and the modern Manchester classic, Runaway’s IPA. Made with an unusually dark crystal malt, it is a beer of rare depth. Brewery tours available.• Pint from £4.20, therunawaybreweryA stone’s throw from the traffic of Great Ancoats Street, this brewery tap has a Zen-like calm. Ornamental plants decorate a minimalist, Scandi-style pale-wood interior, while tasteful electronica burbles away discreetly. It is a space as design-conscious as Cloudwater’s artwork large versions of which are displayed on-site. Cloudwater is zealous about freshness and Unit 9’s 20 taps pour beers kegged and served within seven days from a 3C cold-store. Everything is served in set third, half and two-third measures (no pints), which will irk some people – as may the controversial decision to make Unit 9 cashless and card-only. On the upside, the flat £3.50 pricing makes this one of the cheaper places to experience Cloudwater’s exceptional but notoriously expensive beers. Unit 9 also hosts irregular tap-takeovers with similarly cutting-edge breweries (Verdant, Against The Grain).• Beers £3.50, cloudwaterbrew.coA world away from the sometimes oppressive reverence of the geekiest craft bars, Seven Bro7ther’s Ancoats tap is a looser, friendlier, frequently packed proposition. For all its light hipster stylings (a lot of rough-hewn planks and filament lightbulbs), fundamentally this is a big unpretentious boozer, which happens to sell unusually good beer. The tap selection includes guest beers from breweries as erse as 4T’s and Gipsy Hill but naturally the Salford brewery’s beers dominate. Its stout and keg IPA are dependable drops.• Pint from £3.80, sevenbro7hersLess of a destination than when GRUB ran its street-food events here, this newly revamped brewery-tap (out goes communal seating in comes heaters) remains an essential stop-off on any Manchester crawl if only to try Alphabet’s oatmeal-spiked pale ale, A To The K. In the warren of railway arch units around Piccadilly station, the brewery is jazzily decorated with the fever-dream graphic art that designer Nick Hamilton creates for Alphabet’s, at times, equally out-there beers (for example, Carry On Crampus cranberry bock You’re So Vain salted caramel imperial stout). Alphabet has recently gone down the no-pints, card-only route. Two-third schooners are now its largest serve. Over summer, expect music and street food one-offs in the courtyard.• Two-thirds from £2.60, @ABCtaproomUnusually colourful (its orange banquettes and Perspex back-bar give it a look of a 1980s Top of the Pops set), this Dale Street tap-house serves a mix of quality guest beers (Wild Beer, Mikeller, Burning Sky), and Beatnikz’ hop-forward brews, such as I Smash Citra and Generation IPA. The weekday cask ale deals are notable (recently pie ‘n’ a pint £5, MonTues), as is Beatnikz’s ability to bag high-profile guests for its meet-the-brewer events. For instance Arbor Ales and US star Modern Times.• Pint from £3.70, beatnikzrepublicFurnished with old sofas and salvaged fireplace surrounds, this homely take on the railway arch brew-tap has emerged as an affable, community hub for local beer geeks. It’s a little further out into Ardwick, and variously hosts the Manchester branch of the Mikkeller Running Club and irregular events, such as home-brew meets and themed tastings. Owner Steve Dunkley is fascinated by historic and unusual brewing recipes and usually has one gravity-dispensed or barrel-aged curveball on each week. Regulars swear by his Peterloo porter, a dark beer for all seasons.• Pint from £3, beernouveauEach summer, Blackjack Brewery throws open its railway arch doors for a series of brew-taps. On a warm evening, sat under the courtyard’s DIY pergola, eating astonishingly good Neapolitan pizza from Honest Crust, as a range of erting DJs spin, it is one of the city’s best off-piste industrial hideaways. Out of season, you can also drink Blackjack’s beers (timeless hoppy cask pales, such as New Deck, out-there creations like the jasmine tea saison Dragon’s Tears), at its pub, the Smithfield. A stripped-back, low-frills bolthole serving forward-thinking beers, it is perfect.• Pint from £3.80, @TheSmithfieldNQOn Oxford Road, the shipping-container bar and nano-brewery, Öl, is doing arresting things in the realm of wild foraged saisons and milkshake IPAs (@olbrewerybar card-only). Several other Manchester breweries, mainly in Ancoats and Ardwick, also open for sporadic brew-tap events from spring. Keep an eye on Wander Beyond and Manchester Brewing Co, which has “some new big shiny kit going in” it will unveil over the May and August bank holiday weekends. The consistently brilliant Pomona Island Brew Co will open a regular tap at its Salford Quays brewery this summer, as well as throwing its now annual Manchester Beer Week boat party, launching from city-centre bar, Gas Lamp, where Pomono beers are always available (dates tbc)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1053d40928a0fe11c00fa3cdaba146a0b8250e03/0_0_5394_3596/master/5394.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=036bb9686db7eac3d9dd72c342efe788 1760w","title":"distinct radio voices why we need local heroes","story":"Global radio is extending its geographical homogenisation by ending many local showsWhen the creators of Alan Partridge exiled the disgraced fictional BBC TV presenter to Radio Norwich, the decision saw the comedy in the idea that local radio was a home for hosts who had lost, or couldn’t win, a national slot.Later, Partridge was further humiliated by service on North Norfolk Digital, where the subjects discussed were even more parochially petty.Such jokes identify the serious image problem that town or county wavelengths can have. The insult “it’s a bit local radio” has long been used in national newsrooms to damn a story thought niche or weak.This perceived lack of relevance and glamour is one of the causes of the sharp decline in area-targeted commercial networks, a decline that digital technology has made still worse. When stations served a defined frequency, the boundaries could be enforced.But LBC – originally a London service – has transmitted nationally since 2014. Global’s decision to transmit mainly nationwide products from London will extend this geographical homogenisation.The reasonable defence of commercial networks will be that, given a dying advertising market, they simply cannot compete with an organisation – the BBC – which runs 40 local stations in England and is subsidised with about £150m of licence fee money.But even the BBC has become less locally focused, with more coverage shared between stations. The worry is there are certain stories that do not matter to London or the world but are central to the lives of those in the postcodes involved – which is why it is vital that the local remains a big noise in radio."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a434a5f369f9b854369a5f1ae83745a57efafd6/0_105_2226_1335/master/2226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ec3455ae7ba33b9b9c0f9f60187ec9b","title":"marie kondo declutter mind time psychology","story":"Along with owning too much stuff, we also pile unreasonable demands on our time. It’s time to limit our focuses“We have taken our wants and been told they are needs,” Joseph Ferrari, the lead author in the DePaul study, recently told the New York Times.This, he says, is why so many of us end up with loads and loads of stuff that doesn’t add value to our lives, the accumulation of which weighs us down and stresses us out.Though the above research, and pop-culture hits like the Netflix show Tidying Up with Marie Kondo, examine physical clutter, I’ve got a strong hunch that psychological clutter may be even worse for your health and performance. The more you’ve got going on at any given time, the less energy and attention you’ll have available for each activity. This is problematic because deep engagement is a precursor to fulfillment and enjoyment – a Harvard study found that people are much happier when they are fully present for the activity that they are doing. A rushed or scattered mind is generally not a happy mind.Busyness may have become a modern badge of honor, but that doesn’t mean it’s good for us. “There’s a global epidemic of overscheduling and it’s ruining our health,” writes Elizabeth Evitts Dickinson in the John Hopkins Health Review, citing evidence that when you feel trapped by an unreasonable number of obligations, it’s a quick road to anxiety and hollowness.Better than being chronically busy is to have a limited number of things that you care about and bring your all to them. A wonderful case study is the runner Eliud Kipchoge. As the best marathoner of all time, Kipchoge has countless opportunities to make media appearances and live the life of a celebrity. Yet he prefers a modest lifestyle with a singular focus on running. This, he’s said, makes him happy. “In life, the idea is to be happy,” Kipchoge says in the documentary Breaking2. “So I believe in calm, simple, low-profile life. You live simple, you train hard, and live an honest life. Then you are free.”Decluttering your life doesn’t just improve happiness it improves performance, too. One of the most popular sections in my book Peak Performance is on the notion of being a minimalist to be a maximalist. Nearly all the top performers that my co-author, Steve Magness, and I interviewed for the book were highly selective about how they spent their time and energy. It’s not that they were overly rigid and had no fun. It’s that they only worked on the things that really mattered to them, and they had the confidence to turn down all the things that didn’t – think of it as the Marie Kondo approach applied to your time. “If you want to be really good, if you want to master and thoroughly enjoy one thing, you’ve got to say no to many others,” Michael Joyner, a top researcher at the Mayo Clinic, told us for the book.Decluttering your life may be effective, but that doesn’t make it easy, especially in a world characterized by hyperconnectivity and endless opportunities to do more. The decluttering challenge is universal. Nearly everyone I coach struggles with it. The good news is that a three-step process can help.I go through this process with my coaching clients at least once a year and whenever they are feeling overwhelmed. What’s great is that this same process can be used on more microlevels, too. You could very easily adapt it in the context of your exercise routine or relationships.Remember: more may be more. But that doesn’t mean more is better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d04c6db339fb0d37ba5f81faf0a4ac30d477a553/0_200_5190_3114/master/5190.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08ca123988ae5b568fcb38f663f55c41","title":"fbi struggles to attract new recruits","story":"Report says sharp decline in number of applicants continued last year from a peak of 68,500 in 2009 to a mere 11,500 in 2018The FBI is having trouble recruiting new agents, according to a story this week in the Wall Street Journal. A sharp decline in the number of applicants for special agent positions, long considered among the most prestigious in American law enforcement, continued last year the report says, from a peak of 68,500 in 2009 to a mere 11,500 in 2018.“We had a lot of discussion internally about why the number of special agent applicants were fluctuating so much over the years. We were trying to figure out what’s the story,” Peter Sursi, the man in charge of recruitment for the FBI told the Journal.According to the FBI, the number of already employed special agents has also dropped somewhat over the last few years, from 14,050 in 2014 to 13,906 in 2017.At first blush it might seem that a certain polarizing political figure disparaging the honor and the trustworthiness of the FBI on TV and on Twitter every day might play a role in lowered enthusiasm. From special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Trump’s ties to Russia, which Donald Trump has frequently called a witch hunt, to his spats with former FBI acting director Andrew McCabe and others, scarcely a week goes by without his impugning the law enforcement agency in some way or another.It does seem that under the Trump administration, positive impressions of the FBI, at least among Republicans – perhaps the law and order types you might consider drawn to such work – have in fact dropped.But the decrease in applications began long before Trump was president, the FBI says. They think the problem is economics not politics.“Our recruiters never had to actively encourage special agent applicants to apply before,” Sursi told the Journal. “But the labor market is tight for most employers these days, with more jobs than qualified workers. We have to adjust our strategies to be a competitive option.”The FBI aren’t alone in this, however. The Army, Navy and other military branches have seen recruitment shortages, according to the New York Times and the Army Times.Police forces around the country have also had trouble recruiting of late. The total number of full-time sworn officers has dropped 23,000 since 2013 to about 700,000 according to NPR, who called the officer shortage “a quiet crisis in American policing”.Among the factors most of these reports cite are a booming job market and strong economy. If people can find interesting and decently-paying work elsewhere, it may just be the case that all of the potential unknowns that come with a career in law enforcement no longer seem worth it. Terry Albury, a 17-year FBI veteran, was sentenced to jail last year after leaking internal documents that unveiled how the agency used racial profiling in counter-terror investigations. In 2017, Al Jazeera reported on documents from the FBI that had been monitoring Black Lives Matter activists. In 2016, a variety of groups demanded Congress investigate the FBI’s spying on activists of all kinds, from anti-pipeline protestors to Occupy Wall Street.The ACLU has begun reporting on the FBI’s racial and ethnic “mapping” of American communities.“Nationwide, the FBI is gathering reports on innocent Americans’ so-called ‘suspicious activity’ and sharing it with unknown numbers of federal, state and local government agencies,” the report says.It may be that an increasing number of Americans are fed up with this type of surveillance. We may occasionally, jokingly, take solace in the presence of our own federal agent looking out for us when we’re lonely – but that doesn’t mean most of us want to be the ones doing the dirty work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48a3fbe65be3d5910da2b640d5c7ff63d785f7b3/1093_24_2231_1339/master/2231.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37f919a23489ab0f41477f407d2f5e39","title":"european parliament bloc set to consider ejecting viktor orban","story":"Viktor Orbán could face renewed calls for his expulsion from the European People’s party (EPP) at a gathering of the powerful centre-right bloc next month.The Hungarian prime minister and his Fidesz party will be on the agenda of the EPP political assembly on 20 March, an event intended to approve the group’s manifesto before European parliament elections in May.Two EPP sources told the  that Orbán and his Fidesz party would be up for discussion, even though no official disciplinary procedure has been launched.The Hungarian prime minister is facing a growing backlash from centre-right allies after his government launched an aggressive anti-EU poster campaign targeting the European commission leader, Jean-Claude Juncker, who is also in the EPP. And in a one-page letter sent to households in Hungary, Orbán said the EU “has not learned anything from the horrible terror attacks of the past years” and “wants to bring even more migrants to Europe”.But Orbán’s critics face an uphill battle to expel him from the group. The EPP is Europe’s most powerful political force, with the largest number of seats in the European parliament and nine EU leaders among its ranks.Centre-right Nordic and Baltic parties are considering disciplinary action against Fidesz, adding their concerns to Dutch and Luxembourgish parties, which have criticised Orbán’s policies in the past.Petri Sarvamaa, a Finnish Christian Democrat MEP, told the  that Orbán should not be in the EPP. His National Coalition party is considering whether to add its voice to calls for Orbán to go.In recent days, German political leaders have also taken a more critical stance, following the launch of the anti-EU poster campaign, which was dismissed by Brussels as “a ludicrous conspiracy theory”.Angela Merkel’s successor as leader of Germany’s CDU, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told Der Spiegel last week that it was up to Fidesz to prove it still belonged to the EPP. The CDU could break off contact “it’s no longer possible to come to an understanding,” she said. Merkel reproached Orbán by expressing “full solidarity” with Juncker over the posters and said she would “make that clear” in discussions with Hungary.French EPP president Joseph Daul condemned Orbán last week for “deceitful” and “misleading” claims against the European commission. Daul has previously said it was better to keep an enfant terrible inside the family.Despite the growing anger, many centre-right parties hold with that view, especially in central Europe.Weber, who aspires to lead the next European commission, issued one of his strongest criticism yet of the Hungarian leader over the poster campaign. “One cannot belong to the EPP and campaign against the current EPP commission president.”Speaking to journalists last month, the Hungarian government’s chief spokesman, Zoltán Kovács, dismissed suggestions that Fidesz would be forced to leave the EPP. “We belong there, we are members and our election campaign is going to be in line with the European People’s party.”The procedure to exclude or suspend a political party can be launched by the EPP’s most senior leaders or a joint letter from at least seven parties in five countries.Anna Maria Corazza Bildt, a senior MEP in Sweden’s Moderate party, told the  that the EPP had spent 10 years trying to bring Orbán into line. “We see that not only is it not improving but the situation in Hungary is becoming more and more disturbing.”She cited the forced move of the Central European University to Vienna, pressure on independent media and judges, and the “antisemitic tone with the constant demonisation of George Soros”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09c505cbe606ada96cbb9abe54d6b0d571f37f0/0_99_3436_2062/master/3436.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edf503326eab0930a89f5fc848879d1b","title":"un investigates conduct myanmar rohingya","story":"Exclusive: Inquiry follows claims it ignored warning signs before alleged Rohingya genocideThe UN has launched an inquiry into its conduct in Myanmar over the past decade, where it has been accused of ignoring warning signs of escalating violence prior to an alleged genocide of the Rohingya minority.UN sources have confirmed to the  that the initially hesitant UN secretary general, António Guterres, decided to proceed with the investigation after a “build-up in pressure” within the organisation.It will be headed by Gert Rosenthal, a former foreign minister and Guatemalan permanent representative to the UN, who is thought to have begun overseeing meetings in the role.“This review is not directed at any particular inidual or agency, but rather at how the United Nations as an institution works on the ground and possible lessons learned for the future,” said Stanislav Saling, a spokesperson for the UN in Myanmar, adding that Rosenthal had no plans to travel to Myanmar for his investigations.A senior UN official in New York, who asked not to be identified, said Rosenthal was chosen because “he’s considered to be a very serious and sober expert on UN workings. He knows the house from many different perspectives and is known to be someone who will speak his mind.”There have been multiple calls for a full inquiry into UN operations in Myanmar in recent years, which were described as “glaringly dysfunctional” in a memo written months before the military-led crackdown on the Rohingya in Rakhine state in August 2017.The violence, described by the UN as ethnic cleansing and possible genocide, included the killing of thousands of people, women and children raped, villages razed and forced more than 700,000 to flee over the border to Bangladesh. Marzuki Darusman, the chair of the UN fact-finding Mission on Myanmar, said late last year there was an “ongoing genocide” in Rakhine.Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said: “It’s good that the UN is planning to engage in some serious soul-searching to understand what went wrong with their handling of the Myanmar crisis.“Quite clearly, they failed to see and warn the world about what was clear to us and many others long before August 2017 – that the Burmese military was looking for an opportunity to launch a massive ethnic cleansing operation to get rid of the Rohingya.”Criticism of the UN’s response has focused on allegations against Renata Lok-Dessallien, a former resident coordinator of Myanmar, who was accused of downplaying concerns about worsening abuses against the Rohingya discouraging public statements critical of the NLD government, led by the de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi prioritising development strategies at the expense of human rights and even suppressing internal reports that she did not like. The UN has denied most of these claims.However, several UN figures and diplomats said the emphasis on Lok-Dessallien was misplaced, and that the UN failings were a reflection of much bigger issues within the UN system and the diplomatic community in Myanmar as a whole. In 2017 the UN described Lok-Dessallien “as a tireless advocate for human rights”.The recent UN fact-finding mission to Myanmar, which concluded that the country’s military generals should be investigated for genocide and crimes against humanity for their actions against the Rohingya and other minorities, also called for a review into UN conduct in Myanmar, echoing a recommendation made months earlier by Yanghee Lee, UN special rapporteur for human rights to the country.“The review needs to be independent from the UN and made available publicly when finished,” Lee told the .Indeed, there are concerns that the inquiry will be purposefully limited in its scope and impact and it is not clear if the final report will be made public.According to insiders, there is a wariness within the upper levels of the organisation that amid a climate of increasing hostility towards the UN by governments such as the US, a more wide-ranging inquiry report could sow ision and damage the organisation’s reputation and ability to continue its peacemaking and humanitarian work. The source in New York said moves to initiate the review were stalled by internal tensions.After a hiatus following the controversy around her leadership in Myanmar, Lok-Dessallien is widely expected to be appointed UN resident coordinator for India. She is likely to take up the post before the completion of the Myanmar inquiry, leading to further doubts over the chances it will prompt any inidual accountability.Sources within the UN system said officials at the the organisation’s headquarters in New York did not want a repeat of the damning and internally controversial 2012 Petrie report, authored by the former UN assistant secretary general Charles Petrie.It concluded that during the endgame of the Sri Lankan civil war, where tens of thousands of Tamil civilians were killed, there had been a “systemic failure” by UN agencies on the ground to speak out for and protect civilians.Iniduals and agencies singled out for criticism in the review objected strongly to how their actions were characterised, leading to rifts inside the world body over how to follow up to the investigation.“It’s hard not to say: ‘Here we go again’,” Robertson said. “There were supposed to be lessons learned after the fiasco in Sri Lanka in 2009 but apparently there weren’t.”The review headed by Rosenthal will use Sri Lanka as a reference point against which to judge what lessons have not been learned within the UN system, the  has been told.Comparisons between Sri Lanka and Myanmar were made in a confidential report commissioned by the Office of the UN high commissioner for human rights in Myanmar in 2015.“The situation bears a striking resemblance to the humanitarian community’s systematic failure in the final stages of the war in Sri Lanka, during which hundreds of thousands of Tamils were held against their will in internment camps that were fully paid for and serviced by international humanitarian institutions,” the 2015 report says.Allegations of UN dysfunction in Myanmar have continued since Lok-Dessallien’s departure in 2017. The fact-finding mission report, which was released last August, noted that some UN entities in Myanmar had not cooperated with the investigation.“Things are not as dysfunctional as they were,” said a UN insider based in Geneva, who asked to remain unnamed. “But the fundamental problems and deep isions in opinion, response and strategy remain unresolved. Hopefully the Rosenthal review might be the vehicle that enables them to be addressed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e19989621ec75b2fb42e22076b90755d6f3bd4fb/0_270_6409_3846/master/6409.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f7719b1baf17570b6e0fe6b009620da","title":"how creating a sense of community can help your business thrive","story":"At a time when customer needs are changing rapidly, small businesses must adapt to stay relevant. Many are adopting a community ethos to gain the edge while giving something backAnimator Joanna Susskind opened Glasgow-based design studio Toad’s Caravan in 2010. While running a weekly drawing club on the side, she met dozens of creative freelance workers who were looking for somewhere to work other than their kitchen table. Seeing both a business and social opportunity, Susskind opened up Toad’s Caravan’s office space as a not-for-profit co-working place.Within a few months it was full, with Susskind attributing the project’s success to its collaborative ethos, in which members often share projects, building mini, one-off collectives to tackle larger projects they might not be able to handle alone. “The studio is a great place for connecting with like-minded professionals within our community. It provides a solid base for me to work from, but it runs almost like a cooperative,” she says. “We keep the membership fees low and flexible, so it appeals to everyone.”No matter the sector, businesses that engage with their community are able to build strong relationships with the people in their local area and a reputation for being a business that cares. For example, successful postmasters – the people who run Post Offices – offer a vibrant retail business that builds relationships with and provides a range of services to sole traders and small firms.“Research has shown that a Post Office has a positive impact in the local area, and the postmaster is central to that,” says Amanda Jones, retail director at Post Office. “The most successful ones partner their commercial expertise with a strong sense of social purpose, by fully integrating into their local community and actively engaging with the people. This empowers our postmasters to really understand the communities they serve and ensure their retail offering meets their customers’ everyday and changing needs. I know one postmaster who runs bingo evenings in his local community, and another who, every year, invites someone who he knows would otherwise be alone, to share Christmas dinner with his family.”In 2017, Sean Hudson became postmaster at West Boldon Post Office, a village midway between Sunderland and Newcastle. He and his wife, Katie Hudson, had lived in the village for 20 years and recognised that the Post Office shop could become a hub for the community.Sean, originally a lawyer by profession, says: “The small village communities in that part of Yorkshire were exactly how we remembered them from years ago. We thought it would be great if our own Post Office could go back to being the heart of this village, as it was when we first came here.”In truth, Sean had been growing tired of the law, so he reduced his partnership when the Post Office came on the market and, with Katie, set out to make it the centre of the community once again.The village population is small but erse – a mix of young and old, and people from different career and social backgrounds. This shaped the Hudsons’ strategy to build a business that would appeal to them all. Through social media and Facebook, they have raised their business profile and engaged with the local community in an online space that complements their physical retail presence.Sean says: “We knew that a social media presence was important and also that there were people who don’t use social media, but had family members and carers who do. That has been a very strong link for us. We are already seeing good growth in the retail side, and customers have started to return to the Post Office counter.”One of their community-focused services is “ring and bring”. “If we stock it and you ring us, we’ll bring it to you at no extra cost,” says Sean. “It’s a bit like ‘click and collect’ but more personal. For tech-savvy people, click and collect is an easy concept, but for a lot of people it isn’t. Ring and bring has become very popular with many of our older, less mobile retail customers.”And unlike typical supermarket home delivery services, there’s more to it than simply running into the customer’s home with the groceries and running out. “We always spend a few minutes chatting with them to find out how they are,” he says.The couple are active in many aspects of community life, including helping to set up a volunteer library service following the closure of the local library, and they are members of the residents’ association.Sean describes his role as a challenge and a complete change that is both daunting and exhilarating. He says: “If someone had told me I’d be happier working seven days a week in my current role, than working five days a week in my old job, I wouldn’t have believed them, but it is actually true.”As well as that innate ability to show empathy and engage with people of all ages and all social backgrounds, anyone looking to start a company with a strong community culture also needs a flair for business.Jones says: “They need to develop a retail offering that is relevant to their audience. They must be able to think creatively and, above all, be adaptable.” This goes for postmasters, too. “Like all retail businesses, Post Office has to innovate to maintain its relevance to changing customer needs, so our postmasters must keep pace with evolving digital services and put forward their own ideas on new propositions and ways of working to further improve customer service and experience. That comes with really engaging with, knowing and understanding your local community.”If you’re a community minded entrepreneur, please visit runapostoffice for more information."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3807303.1551205277!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cost of 2 7km dublin cycle path jumps to 20m due to redesign","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA redesign of the scheme plus the construction of a link through Fairview Park, and the requirement to fit in with the Bus Connects  corridor from Clongriffin to the city centre, has resulted in the inflated cost. Photograph Nick BradshawThe cost of installing a new 2.7km “Dutch-style” cycle path from Fairview to Amiens Street in Dublin’s north inner city has almost tripled to €20 million, according to Dublin City Council documents.Councillors in October 2017 approved plans for the segregated cycle route which will connect the city centre with the Dublin Bay cycle path that runs along the coast to from Clontarf to Sutton.The route, which would start at the Alfie Byrne Road north of Fairview Park and continue on each side of the road past the Talbot Street junction on Amiens Street, had at that time, been expected to cost €7 million.However, documents issued by the council this week for the construction of the route have set the cost of the project at €20 million.A redesign of the scheme since it was approved by councillors, the construction of a link through Fairview Park, and the requirement to fit in with the Bus Connects core bus corridor route from Clongriffin to the city centre, has resulted in the inflated cost .The cycle route was first proposed six years ago as a two-way track running on the east side of the road only. However, in 2015, the council’s traffic department said this would not be feasible and instead, it drew up plans for paths on both sides of the road.Felling of 50 treesThe new plans published two years ago, involved the felling of 50 trees in Fairview Park, some of which are more than 100 years old. More than 15,000 people signed an online petition seeking the retention of the trees, some of which were planted in 1908 by nationalist and unionist communities as part of international Arbour Day celebrations.The council subsequently amended its plans to save 42 of the trees, this required the removal of part of the inbound traffic lane running in front of Fairview Park.On approving the scheme councillors ordered further design work be undertaken to achieve better segregation between cyclists, buses, and general traffic, and improved safety for pedestrians.Bus corridorsTo accommodate the enhanced bus corridors, each bus stop will have a “passenger island” with a segregated lane for cyclists to travel behind the stop. Road junctions will be designed in the Dutch style where cyclists and pedestrians are separated from and given priority from traffic.The cycle paths will be two-metres wide and protected by kerbs, and in some places separated from the roadway by trees or parked cars. The project will include the development of a link through Fairview Park along the river Tolka, between North Strand Road and Alfie Byrne Road.The work, which will include the upgrade and reconfiguration of signalised junctions, the installation of toucan crossings, CCTV and lighting, landscaping and utility ersion works, is due to start this year and take two years to complete."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Overweight rodent found itself in trouble after it tried to squeeze through a small gap in a sewer coverFormer Rehab CEO took case over her treatment before D\u0026aacuteil Public Accounts CommitteePeer-to-peer platform steps back from small investors in absence of regulationDonegal man Brendan McLaughlin (51) underwent transplant in 1992Refurbishment of draughty and mouldy flats cancelled after councillors\u0026rsquo voteGlenveagh claims strict design standards for apartments could be relaxed for older peopleChild and Family Agency must be more transparent, Pat Rabbitte will tell committeePaul Quinn defends decision not to flag concerns to Simon Harris and Pascal DonohueFairview to Amiens Street route originally expected to cost \u0026euro7mUK government document says crashing out of EU could result in business failure in NISix fire engines and water tanker deal with blaze at Northwood Carrington complexMays says if MPs reject deal, they can vote on no deal and on extending article 50Women who hide habit miss out on vital monitoring and have more issues, study showsPAC says sites such as Poolbeg and Player Wills left too long in undeveloped limboVictim seriously injured in Drogheda retail park when shots were fired into carFamily seek answers as to how Ms Hawe and her three sons were murdered by Alan HaweLaw Reform Commission details report on regulatory powers and corporate offencesConcerns were raised over a male teacher\u0026rsquos relationship with a former studentDemonstrators demand pension increases that were stripped almost 10 years ago"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3807328.1551219406!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nama criticised for unacceptable housing delays on key sites","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNama sold the debt secured on the former John Player cigarette factory on the South Circular Road  to US property investor Hines in a refinancing deal. Photograph: Alan Betsonhighly critical of Nama over what confidential documents say are “unacceptable” delays to the delivery of housing on key sites it controls, including the Irish Glass Bottle Company site.The documents, drawn up as part of PAC’s work programme argue that the sites have languished in development limbo. They state that the committee is “of the view that delays to the development of sites, such as Poolbeg and Player Wills, for housing are unacceptable”. The committee, alongside the comptroller and auditor general, is one of two bodies responsible for oversight of Nama. PAC, according to the document, will recommend that Nama “prioritises engagement with the local authorities, and other stakeholders, in order to ensure that all obstacles are removed to allow for development of these sites”. Nama last year sold the debt secured on the first of these sites – the former John Player cigarette factory on the South Circular Road – to US property investor Hines in a refinancing deal, and no longer has control of it after being in control of it for a decade. Expanded brief Nama was given an expanded brief in 2014 to facilitate the delivery of residential units amid the emerging housing crisis. It has directly funded the provision of 8,000 units since then, and provided sites for a further 2,500. The committee will also criticise the oversight of Nama’s conflict-of-interest system, designed to prevent assets being sold by Nama from being purchased by people who owe money to the agency, or other “associated debtors”.Nama requires those purchasing assets to sign a declaration that they have no connection to the assets being purchased which would contravene the relevant section of the Nama Act, section 172. However, PAC is set to strongly criticise Nama for a perceived failure to verify that the forms are accurately completed.“The lack of systematic and routine verification of section 172 declarations was unacceptable,” according to the committee discussion document, which recommends that Nama put in place a system to verify the declarations it receives.Non-acceptance of offers The discussion document, drawn up to inform PAC’s conclusions on a range of topics on which it held hearings last year, also makes recommendations about the oversight of the €2.5 million budget used to fund the President’s office – the so-called President’s Establishment.The document states PAC’s view is that it is “unacceptable” the internal audit committee overseeing this budget did not meet prior to 2018, and adds that a report of the audit committee should be published annually."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3807985.1551254634!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit political movement in westminister as clock ticks down","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May told the House of Commons that any Brexit delay would be shortAlmost on the eve of the very last month we have had political movement in Westminster.

Photograph: ReutersToby MelvilleThe UK government has for the first time conceded that businesses in the North might not have enough time to prepare for a no-deal Brexit which could result in “business failure or relocation to Ireland”.The latest briefing document from the UK’s Department for Exiting the European Union also highlights that the “cumulative impact” of a no-deal scenario would “be more severe and last longer” in Northern Ireland than Britain, chiefly, it claims, because of the land border with the EU and the current political stalemate in the North.The 15-page document sets out the UK government’s latest assessment of the implications for business and international trade if the UK were to crash out of the EU in March. It details the “negative effects” of a no-deal exit for the UK as a whole from border issues to increases in food prices, EU tariffs and a general economic slowdown.The briefing document also specifically addresses how businesses in the North would be impacted.“In a no-deal scenario there is an expectation of disruption to closely interwoven supply chains and increasing costs that would affect the viability of many businesses across Northern Ireland.“There is a risk that businesses in Northern Ireland will not have sufficient time to prepare. This could result in business failure, andor relocation to Ireland with knock-on consequences for the Northern Ireland economy and unemployment,” it states.DisruptionIt also contains a stark warning about the immediate outlook for SMEs – which account for 75 per cent of all private sector jobs – and Northern Ireland’s agrifood sector, which the UK Government acknowledges is located in predominately border and rural areas in the event of a no-deal scenario.“It is particularly vulnerable given its reliance on cross-border supply chains in the production stage and in finished products,” the document states.It also confirms that the government intends to “shortly publish further details on its immediate, temporary, arrangements for trade between Northern Ireland and Ireland in a no-deal scenario”.The UK Government’s latest official Brexit communication also reiterates its commitment to avoiding “a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland in any scenario” but it stresses that the British government “would need to work urgently with the Irish Government and the EU to find any sustainable longer-term solution”.Aside from the immediate impact on the North’s economy and business community, a no-deal Brexit would also, according to the UK Government’s latest assessment, cause “disruption” for the single electricity market (SEM), cross-border cooperation on areas such as crime and security, and create the potential for “community tensions to be heightened”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The former Labour Party leader is due to tell an Oireachtas committee resources are “finite” and the recruitment of professional staff, in particular social workers, is “very challenging”. Mr Rabbitte will also say Tusla needs to be more transparent and there is no reason why the agency should “fear greater openness”. Mr Rabbitte is due before the joint Oireachtas committee on children and youth affairs on Wednesday morning to discuss his appointment and his strategic priorities for his term of office. He will tell the committee deficiencies in the agency have been highlighted in recent years and it is “undeniable” challenges continue to exist. “It is also undeniable that there is a transformation under way in the priority that public policy now attaches to caring for vulnerable children and in supporting families who need assistance as compared to even more recent history,” he will say. “As regards the quality of service and consistency of practice, it is unavoidable that there are legacy issues and cultural changes that must be confronted.”Mr Rabbitte is also due to say additional resources over the past couple of years are “very welcome” but that “there will never be sufficient resources to meet the challenges”. ‘Vulnerable to criticism’“In respect of the core business, the shortage of social workers leaves the agency vulnerable to criticism where non-compliance with best practice is sometimes established,” he will say. Mr Rabbitte is also expected to tell the committee “considerable progress” has been made since Tusla’s establishment in 2014 and there has been “little enough attention” given to the “very positive narrative” it has to tell. “Tusla has come through a difficult time over the past 18 months or so. In my view the agency is stronger for it provided that we can show that we have learned the lessons,” he will add. “The challenge of caring for vulnerable children and families will never attain perfection. However, an enormous amount of thought and work has gone into bedding down the agency and in evolving best practice.” Mr Justice Peter Charleton criticised Tusla over its handling of an incorrect sexual abuse complaint made against Sgt Maurice McCabe in his final report at the end of the Disclosures Tribunal last year. Mr Rabbitte’s appointment was confirmed by the Cabinet at its last meeting before Christmas. Mr Rabbitte, who has served as a public representative for 30 years, was appointed by Minister for Children Katherine Zappone following a selection process and began his new role on January 1st. He served as minister for communications, energy and natural resources from 2011 to 2014, leader of the Labour Party from 2002 to 2007, and minister of state for commerce, science and technology from 1994 to 1997.

Britain is the fattest nation in Western Europe, with rates of obesity rising even faster than those in the United States.Two in three adults are overweight or obese.Experts said many cases of Type 2 diabetes could be prevented or delayed by healthy eating, being more active, and losing weight if overweight.Chris Askew, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: “Millions of Type 2 diabetes cases could be prevented if we help people understand their risk and how to reduce it. Even though the older people get the more likely they are to have Type 2 diabetes, it is never too early to know your risk so that you can make changes to prevent or delay it.”The charity is urging those aged 40 or over to have a free NHS health check offered by GPs.It also said their own Know Your Risk online tool could help people to find out their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.Mr Agnew said: “The signs of Type 2 diabetes are often not obvious, that’s why spotting them early can be life-changing. Early diagnosis means that fewer people will experience diabetes-related complications such as sight loss, amputation, kidney failure, stroke and heart disease, because they could seek support to manage their condition effectively as soon as possible.“We urge people over 40 to get an NHS Health Check and we advise everyone to find out their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes with the Know your Risk tool.”Experts said symptoms of diabetes - which include going to the toilet a lot, being really thirsty, feeling more tired than usual and losing weight without trying -  can be easy to miss especially in the early stages.The condition can go undetected for many years, with one in three cases not diagnosed until they have developed complications with their eyes, feet, kidneys or nerves.Under NHS plans, 5,000 people will be put on 800 calorie-a-day liquid diets in a bid to reverse the disease.Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said children should be warned in school about the risks of diabetes, with diagnosis now happening at an ever-younger age.He said: “Telling them that they could lose a leg or go blind from the disease if they fail to look after their health might seem extreme but it\u0027s the truth.”Professor Jonathan Valabhji, national clinical director for diabetes and obesity said: “The growing obesity epidemic is dangerous for the nation’s overall health and worrying for the NHS, fuelling growing numbers of people with Type 2 diabetes as well as costing taxpayers billions every year.This is exactly why the NHS Long Term Plan sets out radical action to tackle this growing problem by expanding the NHS Type 2 Diabetes Prevention Programme so that 200,000 people every year can benefit and introducing a pilot of very low calorie diets that have been shown to put Type 2 diabetes into remission in a significant proportion of those that already have it, he said.Caroline Cerny, from the Obesity Health Alliance said: “This dramatic increase in the number of people living with Type-2 diabetes is likely to spiral further as obesity rates continue to rise. The good news is that we can do something to halt this epidemic.Strong measures from Government and meaningful action from the food and retail industry could transform our environment into one that encourages healthy options. This is why we need the Government to fully implement measures in its childhood obesity plan including restricting unhealthy food promotions and a 9pm watershed on junk food advertising.”Saddleworth Moor fire: \u0026#39Apocalyptic\u0026#39 blaze breaks out in Yorkshire after Britain\u0026#39s hottest ever winter dayPakistan captures Indian pilot after \u0026#39shooting down two Indian jets\u0026#39What next for the Brexit deal and Withdrawal agreement?Comment: Like radio, the United Kingdom has a proud history of separateness Comment: Extending Article 50 is just another route to overturning the Brexit that people voted forTears of rage, \u0026#39appalling disloyalty\u0026#39 and kamikaze Remainers: Inside the remarkable Brexit Cabinet meetingComment: There\u0026#39s only one way to win a culture war against the metropolitan eliteSaddleworth Moor \u0026#39apocalyptic\u0026#39 blaze: Wildfires break out across Britain after hottest ever winter dayBrexit latest news: Theresa May tells Parliament to do its duty and support  deal in latest vote Comment: At last we\u0026#39re getting tough on Hizbollah, but the government mustn\u0026#39t stop thereApp to ‘translate’ women’s feelings triggers fury in JapanNorth Korea plays up Kim Jong-un for Nobel Peace Prize amid suggestion he and Trump could share honourMichael Cohen to reveal he witnessed Donald Trump\u0026#39s \u0026#39lies, racism and cheating\u0026#39 in Congress testimonyNumber of children vaping doubles in five years, new research showsLip filler advert banned after it suggested procedure was \u0026#39as commonplace\u0026#39 as getting haircutMother of girl whose death was part of alleged \u0026#39cover up\u0026#39 by scientists says surgeons \u0026#39have a lot to account for\u0026#39Hadrian\u0026#39s Wall archaeologists discover rude graffiti and pictures of Roman quarrymen who built itVenezuela deports US-based anchor Jorge Ramos who showed Nicolas Maduro footage of food scavengersWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"underwater photographer year 2019 pictures","story":"Underwater Photographer of the Year competition celebrates photography beneath the surface of the ocean, lakes and even swimming pools.Alex Mustard, Chair of the jury.WINNER Marine Conservation and Marine Conservation Photographer of the Year 2019The Caretta caretta turtles spend much of their life in the open ocean.

But we\u0027re going to keep asking questions, he added, walking through Caracas airport.Ramos was detained beneath Miraflores presidential palace late on Monday night, after a televised interview with Mr Maduro took a turn for the worse.Ramos, a household name in Latin America, was 17 minutes into the interview when he showed Mr Maduro footage of young Venezuelan men in Caracas following a bin lorry, rifling through the rubbish as it was thrown into the back and eating the filthy scraps of food they found.“He didn’t like the things we were asking him about the lack of democracy in Venezuela, the torture and the political prisoners,” said Ramos.Soldiers unleash tear gas during trouble at Venezuela border, in picturesHe said he and his team were held for more than two hours, and their equipment confiscated – including their phones and memory cards.“We don’t have anything,” he said. “They confiscated the interviews.”Venezuela’s communications minister did not deny that Ramos was held, but blamed the reporter for staging “a cheap show” which he said was directed by the US state department.He added: “Hundreds of journalists have come through, who have received the decent treatment that we always give to those who do journalistic work.”Short detentions and deportations have become common, especially as reporters facing delays for official permissions seek shortcuts to report in Venezuela.This has come into the spotlight over the past month as Mr Maduro faces his biggest political challenge since he replaced Hugo Chavez six years ago, with dozens of countries recognising his rival Juan Guaido as the country\u0027s legitimate leader.Venezuelan children, who attend school on the Colombian side of the border, have been blocked from class after the border between both countries was closed At least seven foreign journalists who flew in to cover the turmoil were briefly detained in January.A group of MEPs were also turned back at the airport, with the Venezuelan government claiming they came to Venezuela with suspicious intent.Mr Guaido was on Tuesday still in Bogota, having left the country ahead of the planned delivery of humanitarian aid on Saturday. It was unclear when, or how, he would return, given that Mr Maduro banned him from entering the country.The aid delivery ended in fiasco as the convoys were blocked, a truck of supplies was burnt, four died and 300 were injured in violent skirmishes between Venezuelan troops and Mr Guaido’s supporters.A Colombian police officer in Cucuta, Colombia, looks across the border at Venezuelan security forces Mr Maduro says that the aid convoy was an excuse for US military intervention.“They are trying to fabricate a crisis to justify political escalation and a military intervention in Venezuela to bring a war to South America,” he said, speaking to ABC news in his first interview with a US network in many years.The extremist Ku Klux Klan government that Donald Trump directs wants a war over oil, and more than just oil.Jorge Arreaza, Venezuela\u0027s foreign minister, was in New York on Tuesday night for a meeting of the UN Security Council on Venezuela. The US wants the Council to vote this week on a draft resolution calling for elections and the delivery of aid, but Russia and China would block such a resolution.Mr Arreaza told the Security Council that the US-led campaign to oust Mr Maduro had failed.That was the last chapter in the coup on Saturday, he said. Read my lips - it failed. Now is the time for us to return to sanity.Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s ambassador to the UN, supported Mr Arreaza and questioned what other countries would have done if confronted with an attempted illegal state border crossing for the delivery of unknown cargo.Turning to the US, he pointedly noted: One country even wants to build a huge wall on the border of another country to prevent an illegal border crossing.Please review our commenting policySaddleworth Moor fire: \u0026#39Apocalyptic\u0026#39 blaze breaks out in Yorkshire after Britain\u0026#39s hottest ever winter dayPakistan

his nearest challenger, Atiku Abubakar, to more than three million votes.The celebrations began with four solid APC northern states where Buhari has huge support left to declare, making it unlikely that Abubakar could make up the difference.There was no official concession from Abubakar, whose Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) earlier Tuesday called on the electoral commission to halt the count,

korea plays kim jong un nobel peace prize amid suggestion","story":"US President Donald Trump meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during their first summit, June 12 2018 There is growing anticipation in North Korea that Kim Jong-un will be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, fanned by reports in state-run media and mandatory lectures at schools, offices and factories across the country. Suggestions that the North Korean dictator might be in line for the award initially emerged after Mr Kim met US President Donald Trump for their first summit, in Singapore in June, but have stepped up ahead of the two leaders’ meetings this week in Hanoi.“After the first US-North Korean summit, the authorities began saying during propaganda lecture sessions that Kim Jong-un is a front-runner for the Nobel Peace Prize”, a North Korean government official told RFA. “Because the two US-North Korean summits are being held one after the other, the authorities began distributing ‘educational materials for the greatness of our highest leader’, including a lot of propaganda about the Nobel prize”, he said. Another source told RFA that the Nobel Peace Prize is suddenly a hot topic in the North Korean press, with the media claiming that the international media is proclaiming Mr Kim as “the world’s greatest man”.“The propaganda even says that Western and Japanese media sources are lavishing praise upon the Supreme Leader, saying he’s a potential winner of the Peace Prize”. The man that Mr Kim is facing across the negotiating table in Hanoi has also been mentioned as a potential winner of this year’s award, with one possibility that the two men share the prize.“I believe that Mr Trump should receive the Nobel because of the contribution that he has made to achieving peace on the Korean Peninsula, but Mr Kim would not turn the honour down if it was given to both of them together”, said Kim Myong-chol, executive director of the Centre for Korean-American Peace and an unofficial spokesman for the North Korean government in Japan. Mr Kim told The  that he “cannot understand” accusations levelled against Mr Trump that he is ceding too much to North Korea in return for vague promises from the North Korean regime to scrap its nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. “The decision on the award is in the hands of the Nobel committee, but I am sure that Mr Kim would accept it if he was nominated with Mr Trump”, he said. “It would be a great honour and one that indicates that things on the Korean Peninsula are going in a very favourable direction”. Please review our commenting policySaddleworth Moor fire: \u0026#39Apocalyptic\u0026#39 blaze breaks out in Yorkshire after Britain\u0026#39s hottest ever winter dayPakistan captures

down two Indian jets and carried out strikes into its neighbour to demonstrate its right to self defence a day after Indian jets hit its own territory.A statement from Pakistan\u0027s foreign ministry, said the Pakistan air force launched strikes across the disputed line of control in Kashmir.It said strikes had been taken at non-military targets avoiding civilian casualties.The claim came a little over 24 hours after Delhi said it had struck a Jaish-e-Mohammad training camp near Balakot where it said militants were preparing for imminent terrorist attacks.Islamabad had denied any camp was struck, but on Tuesday warned India to prepare for a surprise and vowed a befitting response at a time and place of its choosing.In a statement headed Pakistan strikes back, the foreign ministry said the action was not retaliation  to continued Indian belligerence.Pakistan has therefore, taken strikes at non military target, avoiding human loss and collateral damage. Sole purpose being to demonstrate our right, will and capability for self defence. A spokesman for Pakistan\u0027s military said that Indian jets had then crossed the line of control and the Pakistan air forces had gone on to shoot two of them down inside Pakistani airspace.One of the aircraft fell inside Azad Jammu and Kashmir, while other fell inside Indian Occupied Kashmir. One Indian pilot arrested by troops on ground while two in the area, said Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor.There was no immediate response from Delhi, but Indian media did report an Indian air force jet crashed in Indian-controlled Kashmir on Wednesday morning.Delhi said on Tuesday it had said it had struck a pre-emptive blow against the Pakistan-based militant group it blames for a suicide bomb that killed at least 40 paramilitary police in Kashmir earlier this month.The force of jets destroyed a hilltop training camp near Balakot where Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) jihadists were preparing an imminent attack, the country\u0027s foreign minister said.Unconfirmed pictures of the wreckage of the Indian aircraftBut Pakistan dismissed that claim as “fictitious” and “self-serving”, saying its own jets had intercepted the raiding force and seen it off. Pakistan\u0027s military said the Indian jets dropped their payload of bombs “in haste” as they fled and they caused no damage after landing in deserted forest.Villagers near Balakot said they had been woken by jets and four blasts in an area close to a JeM madrassa. But they denied heavy casualties and said the damage was largely to trees. One person was wounded.We saw trees fallen down and one house damaged and four craters where the bombs had fallen, said Mohammad Ajmal, a 25-year-old who visited the site told Reuters.Another neighbour, who declined to be named, said JeM ran a nearby Islamic school.Kashmiri villagers gather near the wreckage of an Indian aircraft after it crashed in Budgam areaAn Indian attack had been widely predicted as Narendra Modi faced domestic outrage over the bomb attack in Pulwama blamed on JeM.Pakistan has long been accused of harbouring and supporting militant groups as tools of its foreign policy in India, Kashmir and Afghanistan. JeM is a primarily anti-India group that forged ties with al Qaeda and has been on a UN terrorist list since 2001. India says the JeM was also behind the 2001 attack on the Indian parliament and on an Indian air force base in 2016. Pakistan denies any involvement in the Pulwama attack and has challenged Delhi to deliver actionable intelligence on who carried out the attack.Western diplomats now fear any counter retaliation by Pakistan could dangerously escalate the stand-off and trigger an international crisis.One diplomat said both sides must try to carefully measure their action to satisfy domestic nationalist fervour, while not provoking all out war. However with an Indian general election only weeks away, Mr Modi had come under intense pressure to act.As news channels on both sides of the border became increasingly bellicose, a Pakistani military spokesman even alluded to its nuclear arsenal, highlighting the escalation in hostile rhetoric.The spokesman said a command and control authority meeting, which decides over the use of nuclear weapons, had been convened for Wednesday, adding: You all know what that means.The Indian strike 30 miles from the frontier was thought to be the first strike inside its neighbour\u0027s territory since their 1971 war. Indian military sources said 12 French Mirage 2000 fighters crossed the line of control iding the adversaries in Kashmir on their raid into Pakistani territory at around 3.15am local time.Accompanied by an airborne early warning and control aircraft and a mid-air re-fueller, the Mirages reportedly employed 1000kg precision guided munitions to hit their targets in a mission that lasted a few minutes.Sign up for your essential, twice-daily briefing from The  with our free Front Page newsletter.Please review our commenting policySaddleworth Moor fire: \u0026#39Apocalyptic\u0026#39 blaze breaks out in Yorkshire after Britain\u0026#39s hottest ever winter dayWhat next for the Brexit deal and Withdrawal agreement?Comment: Like radio, the United Kingdom has a proud history of separateness Comment: Extending Article 50 is just another route to overturning the Brexit that people voted forTears of rage, \u0026#39appalling disloyalty\u0026#39 and kamikaze Remainers: Inside the remarkable Brexit Cabinet meetingComment: There\u0026#39s only one way to win a culture war against the metropolitan eliteSaddleworth Moor \u0026#39apocalyptic\u0026#39 blaze: Wildfires break out across Britain after hottest ever winter dayBrexit latest news: Theresa May tells Parliament to do its duty and support  deal in latest vote Comment: At last we\u0026#39re getting tough on Hizbollah, but the government mustn\u0026#39t stop thereApp to ‘translate’ women’s feelings triggers fury in JapanNorth Korea plays up Kim Jong-un for Nobel Peace Prize amid suggestion he and Trump could share honourMichael Cohen to reveal he witnessed Donald Trump\u0026#39s \u0026#39lies, racism and cheating\u0026#39 in Congress testimonyNumber of children vaping doubles in five years, new research showsLip filler advert banned after it suggested procedure was \u0026#39as commonplace\u0026#39 as getting haircutMother of girl whose death was part of alleged \u0026#39cover up\u0026#39 by scientists says surgeons \u0026#39have a lot to account for\u0026#39Hadrian\u0026#39s Wall archaeologists discover rude graffiti and pictures of Roman quarrymen who built itVenezuela deports US-based anchor Jorge Ramos who showed Nicolas Maduro footage of food scavengers183 passengers stuck on Oregon train for 36 hoursWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/27/TELEMMGLPICT000189838996_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqoVHpc64Dw_9TYL9Y5RROLea30GqgKRhYIESHWGI-aIQ.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"pakistan claims air strikes indian territory demonstrate right","story":"The burning remains of an Indian Air Force aircraft some 30kms from Srinagar on WednesdayPakistan said on Wednesday morning it had shot down two Indian jets and carried out strikes into its neighbour to demonstrate its right to self defence a day after Indian jets hit its own territory.A statement from Pakistan\u0027s foreign ministry, said the Pakistan air force launched strikes across the disputed line of control in Kashmir.It said strikes had been taken at non-military targets avoiding civilian casualties.The claim came a little over 24 hours after Delhi said it had struck a Jaish-e-Mohammad training camp near Balakot where it said militants were preparing for imminent terrorist attacks.Islamabad had denied any camp was struck, but on Tuesday warned India to prepare for a surprise and vowed a befitting response at a time and place of its choosing.In a statement headed Pakistan strikes back, the foreign ministry said the action was not retaliation  to continued Indian belligerence.Pakistan has therefore, taken strikes at non military target, avoiding human loss and collateral damage.

The group is changing its aerial emergency services businesses to comply with European operating requirements, and said ongoing additional costs relating to the new structures will be around £10m per year. The firm also said underlying earnings expectations for 2019 remain unchanged, with slightly higher margins offsetting slower revenue growth.Total revenue is expected to drop to £5.2bn, compared with £5.36bn in the previous year, due to lower activity in its rail business.Chief executive Archie Bethel said: “We continue to make good operational and strategic progress and won some great new contracts in the period including an expansion into the aerial emergency services market in North America, a significant win in Australia and securing the next 10 years for our rail business.Created with Sketch.

Analysts at Shore Capital said: “The short-term performance of Babcock remains frustrating for investors, in our view, with additional charges and some revenue weakness from changing structure impacting operations.“The long-term positioning still remains sound, in our view.

Sterling was up 0.81 per cent against the dollar at $1.3203 and rose 0.77 per cent against the euro to hit €1.1620. The upward move came after reports Theresa May is planning to delay Brexit, with the\u0026nbspextension of Article 50 put on the table as an option in the House of Commons\u0026nbspon Tuesday. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn made a dramatic U-turn on Monday and said Labour would back a second referendum.Michael Brown, senior analyst at Caxton FX, said: “The pound’s gains are a result of markets beginning to price in an extension to the Article 50 negotiating period.

Confirmation of such a delay would likely strengthen the pound further in the near term, though political headwinds remain.”Meanwhile, Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, warned “a major risk accompanied by extending Article 50 is that Britain will find itself trapped in a Brexit limbo”. “While the pound has scope to extend gains on Brexit delay expectations, the medium to longer term outlook remains blurred by a thick cloud of uncertainty,” he added.

Critics of the streaming service have\u0026nbspno cause to feel schadenfreude at it missing out on the biggest prize.\u0026nbspThose opponents\u0026nbsphave stirred a heated debate about the film’s status,\u0026nbspmost recently in the context of\u0026nbspthe Baftas where Roma did (deservedly) win best film.\u0026nbspThe boss of Vue Cinemas, one of the UK’s biggest chains, wrote a furious open letter to Bafta chief Amanda Berry in response to Roma’s presence in the lists, threatening to pull the firm’s support from the annual shindig.Created with Sketch.Biggest talking points of the Oscars Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 Lafy Gaga and Bradley Cooper perform \u0027Shallow\u0027A Star is Born actors Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper performed their Oscar-winning song “Shallow” at this year’s Oscars ceremony and set social media alight.Best Actor winner Rami Malek caused concern when he fell off stage after accepting his award.

The latter arrived with the announcement that Green Book had beaten out the category’s frontrunner, Roma, to Best Picture. It was a dismal reminder that progress is a slow, tedious process.

Given the adorable viral video he posted in reaction to the nod, the countless selfies with every Hollywood actor he comes across, and the interviews in which he’s grinning ear to ear, it’s clear Grant decided to grab the opportunity with both hands.Tim Richards derisively described the film as a “made for TV movie” on account of its limited cinematic release.\u0026nbspHe said that it was still unclear\u0026nbspwhether Roma was screened on more than 13 UK screens at the art house Curzon Cinema chain, “representing less than 0.5 per cent of the cinema market” and for a week at the Filmhouse in Edinburgh.Richards went on to point to Bafta’s rules stating that: “Films should not be screened purely to qualify them for these awards, and the film committee may not accept entries if they do not deem the theatrical release to be meaningful.Bafta decided Curzon’s screens made it meaningful enough.\u0026nbspI was raised by domestic servants like the one in RomaThe controversy is far from unique to the UK. AMC Cinemas and Regal, two major US chains, refused to play Roma as part of their best picture Oscar showcases and didn’t participate in its very limited US theatrical run because of the short window available before Netflix subscribers got their hands on it. Even the offer of cheap rentals couldn’t entice them.\u0026nbspMexico, the film’s home market, was not immune either. Cuarón went so far as to tweet his disappointment that it was showing on more screens in Poland than his native land as a result of big chains saying no.\u0026nbspBut are cinema operators right to draw a global line in the sand over the “theatrical window”\u0026nbspthat Richards says “has successfully served all sides of our industry for many decades and is one of the core differentiators that makes cinema unique”?How about asking yourself this: how many subtitled films\u0026nbspwould you normally expect to see at your local multiplex, regardless of how good they are?\u0026nbspAlfonso Cuaron wins Best Director for RomaArthouse cinemas are mostly where they live. Roma is different chiefly because it has an A-list Hollywood director and a distributor with enough cash to give\u0026nbspit an Oscar campaign.Awards films don’t always get much of a run even when\u0026nbspthey’re in English. My local multiplex, for example, supported If Beale Street Could Talk\u0026nbspwith just one of its 14 screens for barely a week.\u0026nbspThe fact that I was able to catch it was greatly assisted by my having booked time off during that week.\u0026nbspRoma, by contrast, didn’t involve my jumping through any of the hoops families usually have to jump through when the parents want to see the sort of film they can’t take the kids along to. It was there, at my convenience, and it has remained in my head ever since.\u0026nbspIt’s the sort of film that does that.At the core of this controversy is a clash of business models, with Netflix’s desire to give its subscribers what it has paid for as soon as possible, clashing with the big chains’ demand for their cherished period of exclusivity.\u0026nbspBaftasAs ever, in these situations, the customer ultimately loses. I would still like to see Roma on a large screen and I would make the effort to do so, even after viewing it at home. The experience would be worth it.\u0026nbspRichards may be right to take shots at Netflix for scarcely making previous releases available for any sort of cinematic run at all, regardless of the window.\u0026nbspBut as regards the “window”\u0026nbspas a concept and the terms on which Roma was released, he’s on shakier ground. Note how he says the window has “successfully served all sides of our industry for many decades”. The problem is with that “many decades”. Things change.\u0026nbspSteven Spielberg takes thinly veiled shots at streaming servicesDespite people repeatedly calling its doom, the silver screen has adapted to a lot of changes, a bewildering array of them. It has weathered the emergence of TV, the widespread purchase\u0026nbspof home entertainment systems, video gaming, the internet, the explosion of choice in people’s leisure options.\u0026nbspIt can survive Netflix too, and cinemas’ rising global gross revenues\u0026nbspsuggests they are doing just that. I’d be willing to put money on their surviving shorter exclusivity windows for Netflix or for other films too.\u0026nbspThe latter’s customers, as a rule, tend to go to the cinema more than non-subscribers do anyway. They like movies. If they’re like me, they’ll often watch them more than once. But the first preference will always be to see them on the big screen, and it doesn’t matter whether it’s Roma or Captain Marvel, about which my daughter and I are positively breathless in anticipation.\u0026nbspThe cinema offers an experience that Netflix cannot, and that is worth paying extra for.\u0026nbspThe disruptive threat Netflix poses is being felt much more by traditional television operators than it is by movie theatre chains.\u0026nbspNetflix needs to change its tune too though. It should be more open to giving more of its properties a cinematic release as Amazon, which admittedly has a rather different business model, has done very successfully.\u0026nbspSurely the various sides in this debate ought to be be capable of reaching a compromise? It should to be in their interests to do so. It would certainly be in the interests of movie lovers and movie goers and, well, art.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

The group is changing its aerial emergency services businesses to comply with European operating requirements, and said ongoing additional costs relating to the new structures will be around £10m per year. The firm also said underlying earnings expectations for 2019 remain unchanged, with slightly higher margins offsetting slower revenue growth.Total revenue is expected to drop to £5.2bn, compared with £5.36bn in the previous year, due to lower activity in its rail business.Chief executive Archie Bethel said: “We continue to make good operational and strategic progress and won some great new contracts in the period including an expansion into the aerial emergency services market in North America, a significant win in Australia and securing the next 10 years for our rail business.Created with Sketch.

Sterling was up 0.81 per cent against the dollar at $1.3203 and rose 0.77 per cent against the euro to hit €1.1620. The upward move came after reports Theresa May is planning to delay Brexit, with the\u0026nbspextension of Article 50 put on the table as an option in the House of Commons\u0026nbspon Tuesday.

That means there must be at least 90 days (roughly three months) left on your passport beyond your intended date of departure.914 Online registration prior to travel – ETIASFrom 2021, non-EU nationals who do not require a visa to enter the Schengen area – including British travellers – will need to request prior authorisation to visit Schengen countries.A large number of travel providers – even including National Express coaches – have added “Brexit clauses” to their terms and conditions. These generally specify that they will not be liable for “consequential losses” as a result of Brexit-related issues1114 ‘Fast track’ lanes for passport control entering EU countriesBritish passport holders will not be able to use them, and must join the queue for third-country nationals.The ferry industry insists vessels will continue to sail. The UK Chamber of Shipping says: “Unlike the carriage of cargo, trade deals do not have a significant effect on the cruise and passenger ferry industry. The explicit standardisation of commodity codes and tariffs associated with trade deals have little relevance to holidaymakers.”The EU says: “If you fall ill or have an accident during a visit to another EU country, as an EU citizen you have the right to receive the necessary public healthcare in any EU country under the same conditions as people in the host country.” The EHIC also works in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. From 30 March 2019, the law banning mobile phone firms from charging extra for calls and data in Europe will cease, though operators have yet to set out exactly what will replace it. In theory, mobile phone firms can impose whatever fees they think the market will bear.“Though a delay is simply pushing back the exit date, and doesn’t solve anything itself, markets are taking solace in the fact that such a move would delay a cliff-edge\u0026nbspno-deal scenario. Confirmation of such a delay would likely strengthen the pound further in the near term, though political headwinds remain.”Meanwhile, Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, warned “a major risk accompanied by extending Article 50 is that Britain will find itself trapped in a Brexit limbo”. “While the pound has scope to extend gains on Brexit delay expectations, the medium to longer term outlook remains blurred by a thick cloud of uncertainty,” he added. UK travellers to Europe face long passport queues under no-deal BrexitBrexit restructuring to cost UK engineering firm Babcock £10mWe’re finally heading for a ‘Mad Max Brexit dystopia’“With the odds of a second referendum also rising after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn made a U-turn to back the move, another question floating in the air is whether there will even be a Brexit.“With just over one month left until the UK is scheduled to leave the European Union, we expect the pound to display extreme levels of sensitivity and volatility to Brexit headlines.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

But scientists didn\u0027t know that they themselves were still wrapped in the edges of the\u0026nbspgeocorona.The extra source of hydrogen laying far out from Earth is not enough to allow space exploration, or to support any kind of human life. Down here, it would be referred to as a vacuum.But fortunately those particles do not pose any threat for anyone interacting with them, such as future space travellers that hope to journey to orbit around the Moon.“There is also ultraviolet radiation associated to the geocorona, as the hydrogen atoms scatter sunlight in all directions, but the impact on astronauts in lunar orbit would be negligible compared to the main source of radiation -- the Sun,” says Jean-Loup Bertaux, co-author and former principal investigator of SWAN, the instrument that made the founding.But it could get in the way of future observations around the Moon, the researchers caution.“Space telescopes observing the sky in ultraviolet wavelengths to study the chemical composition of stars and galaxies would need to take this into account,” adds Jean-Loup.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Pay, holiday entitlement and benefits for teachers will remain unchanged.Mr Elliott said: “This is about moving away from a culture that has developed in the teaching profession of over burdening staff with excessively long hours.\u0026nbspThe benefit to the students is that they we will be able to recruit, train and most crucially retain the very best teachers which means better quality of teaching in the classroom.”It comes after experts\u0026nbspwarned this week that there was an urgent need to ensure there were enough teachers amid rising pupil numbers, a shortfall in trainees and more teachers quitting.Last month, the government published its Teacher Recruitment and Retention Strategy last month to reduce workload and encourage more teachers to stay in the profession.Additional reporting by SWNSWe’ll tell you what’s true.

It looked to be a straight-forward victory for the Spaniard as he surged into a two-set lead, but Murray is not a three-time Grand Slam champion for nothing and he supremely levelled the match despite hobbling around the court from the get-go. However, in the end his hip injury just took too much out of him, and Bautista Agut clinched a breath-taking 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 (4-7), 2-6 victory to reach the second round where he\u0027ll face Australia\u0027s John MillmanBritish Prime Minister, Theresa May and her husband Philip attend Sunday morning prayers at her local church in Maidenhead, Britain, 13 January 2019.

Struggling to hold back tears, the 31-year-old Scot said that the continuing pain from what he described as his “severely damaged right hip” had led him to decide to end his career this year.

The idea is to give people back control of their data and end the exploitation and monetisation of people\u0027s private lives by the likes of Facebook and Google.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHTC describes its Exodus 1 as the first smartphone built for this new internet and it is the brainchild of Phil Chen, the appropriately-titled \u0027decentralized chief officer\u0027 of the Taiwanese firm.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re this far into the information age and there\u0027s barely any conversation about digital property, Chen tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspAll of our private data – from credit history to search data – is handled by third parties. We don\u0027t own or control any of it. Instead, it is just seven companies in the world that control almost all of the data. They have become more powerful than governments.The way to get the power back, Chen says, is to introduce a paradigm shift to the big data business models of these large tech companies, from the apps we use, to the way we pay.\u0026nbspThese blockchain phones operate on the same underlying technology that supports bitcoin, so it is no surprise that cryptocurrencies form a key role in their operation.At MWC, HTC is also introducing a new range of decentralised apps – or\u0026nbspdApps\u0026nbsp– that do not share or send data back to a centralised company or server. Some apps even allow people to monetise their own data, by selling it for cryptocurrency.Payments can also go the other way, meaning users can make micropayments directly to websites and content creators without the need for transaction fees.\u0026nbspEven the phone\u0027s default browser, Opera, supports\u0026nbspsuch functionality, describing itself as the world\u0027s first crypto-ready browser.We are at the dawn of a new generation of the Web, one where new decentralized services will challenge the status quo, says Charles Hamel, head of crypto at Opera.\u0026nbspHTC and Opera have both made the bold decision to be the first to step up and enable this transformation.ethereum (HTC)Like other blockchain phones, such as the Sirin\u0026nbspFinney, the HTC Exodus 1 comes with an in-built cryptocurrency wallet that can store private keys for\u0026nbspbitcoin, ether and litecoin\u0026nbspoffline. By not being connected to the internet, this cold-storage wallet protects the funds from hacking, as well as a person\u0027s private data.Until now, the HTC Exodus has only been available to buy in cryptocurrency\u0026nbspbut from March people will be able to purchase it using traditional fiat currency, with the eventual hope that the phone and the decentralised web will make it into the mainstream.I don\u0027t like calling it a blockchain phone because it\u0027s not just for crypto geeks, Chen says.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearIt\u0027s been 10 years since the birth of bitcoin and blockchain technology but the industry is still very much in its infancy.Interest in cryptocurrency and blockchain has been in decline ever since bitcoin\u0027s dramatic price crash, which saw the cryptocurrency lose more than three quarters of its value in 2018.Bitcoin price predictions for 2019: From $0 to $36,000, experts weigh Online analytics show Google searches for both terms have been in free-fall during that time, and according to Gartner, the technology entered the so-called \u0027trough of disillusionment\u0027 phase in its 2018\u0026nbspHype Cycle for Emerging Technologies\u0026nbspreport.The leading market research firm says it may be another 10 years before it reaches the \u0027plateau of productivity\u0027 and begins to see widespread adoption.For this to happen, Chen says, it will likely involve the very tech giants that this technology poses a threat to. Their considerable reach means their adoption of such technology would automatically push it into the mainstream. Another scenario would be that continued data breaches propel\u0026nbspthe conversation of digital property into the spotlight.People are becoming more aware of their data and will realise this is part of the solution, he says. This could spread like wildfire. The tech giants may try to quell its spread, but ultimately they may have to choose between fuelling it or getting burnt and left behind.The HTC Exodus 1 and Sirin\u0026nbspFinney\u0026nbspmay be the first, but blockchain technology is already seeping into more mainstream devices. Earlier this month, Samsung announced its flagship Galaxy S10 range of smartphones, which came with a Blockchain Keystore.There are also rumours that Facebook is planning to launch its own cryptocurrency, which could facilitate payments across its range of messaging apps – from WhatsApp to Messenger. With close to 2 billion users worldwide, such a move could create a currency to rival the dominance of the\u0026nbspUS dollar almost overnight.In a recent interview with Harvard Law professor Jonathan Zittrain, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg explained how blockchain-based authentication could make the social network more secure. But he added: I\u0026nbsphaven\u0027t figured out a way to make this work out.With the technological and financial resources at his disposal, it may just be that Zuckerberg simply hasn\u0027t figured out a way to implement the technology in a way that Facebook can still claim ownership\u0026nbspto it.blockcain smartphones (HTC)The open, decentralised and borderless nature of blockchain\u0026nbspis the reason blockchain remains the only technology vertical not dominated by the incumbents of the industry – it is antithetical to their current business model. The likes of Amazon and Google are leading the way in everything from fintech\u0026nbspto artificial intelligence, as these are all technologies they can control and own.The two largest smartphone makers, Samsung and Huawei, both profit from personal data through their cloud storage businesses. It could therefore fall to Apple to create that spark.Tim Cook keeps talking about privacy but can he take the next step? I\u0027m hopeful and I would be their first cheerleader if they did, Chen says.\u0026nbspThis is a big, giant leap, but we are a David among Goliaths. It will take a giant company to start reversing this tide.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As a new breed of smartphones, Huawei Mate X combines 5G, foldable screen, AI and an all-new mode of interfacing to provide consumers with an unprecedented user experience.The Huawei Mate X will be the first key for consumers to open the door to 5G smart living.The company confirmed the new device would cost 2,299 Euro - higher than Samsung\u0027s Galaxy Fold, which has been given a price tag of 1,980 dollars.The Chinese firm\u0027s presence in the 5G infrastructure market remains a geopolitical talking point, with the United States warning European countries it may find it difficult to work with anyone who choose to use Huawei products in their networks, after raising security concerns over the Chinese company.But Huawei appears to be ignoring these on-going issues as it continues to expand its phone business.Now the second largest smartphone maker in the world, it is also due to unveil a new range of flagship devices in Paris next month.In terms of its foldable device, The Mate X will also come with fingerprint sensor built into its power button as well as featuring a camera system engineered with German camera firm Leica.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If we can do that, then the whole thing will take off and there will be thousands of companies doing creative things.”Blue Origin has already carried out several successful flights of its New Shepard reusable rocket and the company plans to use it to take people into space later this year.Despite similar ambitions by SpaceX and Virgin Galactic, Bezos insisted\u0026nbspat the New York event that it is not a race, stating, “We will fly when we’re ready.”He also stated that his goal for Blue Origin is different to that of Musk, who has consistently said that he wants to send people to live on Mars.Bezos has been reinvesting money he made at Amazon since he started his space exploration company Blue Origin more than a decade ago (Getty)Musk even predicted last year that there is a 70 per cent chance that he would go to Mars himself. Bezos\u0026nbspsaid he had a different long-term vision for humanity, which involves moving heavy industry and energy production into space in order to protect Earth.“My friends who want to move to Mars – I say, ‘do me a favour, go live on the top of Mount Everest for a year first, and see if you like it. Because it’s a garden paradise compared to Mars,” Bezos said.“We want to go to space to protect this planet. That’s why the company’s named Blue Origin – it’s the blue planet that’s where we’re from.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At first glance, they look like a normal phone – but they are actually folded in the middle, and unfolding them makes the screen twice as big.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe handsets rely on a range of technologies that have only just become available, making 2019 the first time companies like Samsung have been able to make the phones available to the public. Chief among those innovations is flexible displays, which allow the handsets to bend in the middle and fold over.As the technology has become more mainstream, so have the phones using it – and the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this week has played host to the announcement of a variety of bendy handsets.\u0026nbspMany of the companies didn\u0027t actually allow people to use the phones, and they are not widely available.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

They use futuristic motors to allow them to be precisely tightened up automatically, without any shoelaces or other input.All of that can be controlled by an app, which allows people to slip on the shoes and then let the motors do the work of tightening them up, in a way shoelaces would traditionally work. They use much the same technology that allowed Nike to recreate the self-lacing shoes from Back To The Future in a limited run.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut that feature has broken after the Android app stopped syncing with the sneakers. Now, the shoes have lost one of their main features and cannot be controlled in the way they are intended.The problems have led to a raft of one star reviews on the Google Play Store, as customers complain the shoes are crashing.Created with Sketch.Best vegan shoes for women Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Have you lusted after this classic three-eye shoe with its trademark yellow stitching for years while bemoaning its lack of vegan credentials? Well, good things come to those who wait. The iconic 1461s from heritage Midlands brand Dr Martens are now also being made in a super shiny synthetic material that mimics patent leather, so that everybody – men included! – can bring a touch of rockstar to their footwear. The inner sole is worth paying that bit for – it’s air-cushioned and resistant to oil, meaning no slipping and blisters. We were relieved to find that these didn’t need to be broken in like other Docs do – they were comfy from the first day of wearing them and looked slick with trousersleggings or a grungy dress. Colour-wise, you can choose from black, the cherry red (seen here), silver chrome or rose gold chrome.Firstly, yes, these are Star Wars-themed trainers (think rubber Rebel Alliance badge, Star Wars logo and galactic silver colouring), so if you’re not a fan of the movie space saga, they might not be for you. If you or a friend are, however, they’ll make the perfect affordable footwear gift. They slip on and are fantastically comfortable from the off. The outer is made with linen and Pinatex (a fibre made from pineapple leaves), the lining is organic cotton canvas and the insole is made from cork and natural latex, which moulds to your natural foot shape. Islington-born brand Po-Zu (meaning to pause in Japanese) is not entirely vegan, but much of its offering is, and all shoes are ethically produced in Portuguese or Sri Lankan factories using sustainable materials. For the height of vegan sophistication, no-one does brogues better than Will’s Vegan Store in London. Made with a kind of Italian faux leather created from plants and organic bio oil, they are fully decked out with the traditional brogue trim. Our top colour pick is the tan – it shows up all that intricate stitching beautifully – but they come in black or dark brown too. The durable rubber soles offer strong grip, the comfy insoles are made with recycled rubber and there’s a small block heel for added suave. Sizing is regular though if you normally look for halves, go one up. The Vegan Society has given this entire range the green light, and Will’s is a carbon neutral company that only uses plastic-free packaging, making this the ultimate in ethical browsing.411 Merrell all out crush 2 gore-tex: £120, MerrellFor the more active vegans among you, trustworthy trainers are a must-buy. US brand Merrell often pops up as a go-to brand for its small but reliable range of versatile shoes and after trying a pair for ourselves, we can see why. This lightweight pair of colourful kicks are built from Gore-Tex, a synthetic material, which is breathable and waterproof so will protect your feet in all running conditions. The heel is lined with lycra to help prevent rubbing and the sole boasts an impressive grip, even through slippy mud. In fact, these were designed especially with Tough Mudder-type challenges in mind. Expect your arches to feel well-supported, with plenty of room for broader feet. They come in black too, but why go boring when you can go jazzy with these bright blue, pink and coral dazzlers? Half sizes are also available.What we love about Birks is that you’re offered the choice between regular width (on the wide side) and narrow width, meaning everyone can find a pair of sandals to live in next summer, regardless of the shape of their feet. These have criss-crossed straps that are more slender than the classic design you might be used to. They’re made from Birko-Flor – essentially PVC with a breathable fleece-like lining. Its look mimics leather’s two-tone effect and feels just as gentle on the skin while being easier to clean. It’s win-win. The footbed, meanwhile, is the German footwear giant’s standard cork with arch support, only it’s lined with microfibre, not suede. The sole is made from an elastic material with excellent cushioning. Our pick of the three colours is the cream (pair it with any summer dress imaginable), but we might have to splurge on the dark grey and rose too. Here’s hoping they offer a vegan version of the yellow ones soon.611 Collection \u0026amp Co porto black lace up brogues: £120, Collection \u0026amp CoFor something that bit edgier, check out the new, fully vegan, Bristol-based footwear brand Collection \u0026amp Co, who are doing all sorts of cool things with waste materials in an effort to be more sustainable. We fell in love with these lace-up brogues, which come in jet black or rusty orange. They’re made in small, ethically-run Portuguese factories from soft faux leather, with faux suede side panels to add textural interest to the design. They slip on and off and have padded insoles for extra comfort, while rubber soles will withstand a pounding of the streets on a shopping mission. The 4cm block heels add a glam bit of height, although shoe lovers with wider feet might want to go for a size up as these are a bit on the narrow side. Oh, and they’ve got Peta’s seal of approval, too.Go back to basics with some canvas shoes specially designed by minimalist British shoe company VivoBarefoot to mimic the sensation of being barefoot and free. These dotty delights are handmade in Ethiopia in partnership with social enterprise, Soul of Africa, which supports education projects for disadvantaged kids. Even the print – choose from black or natural – has been designed in collaboration with local painters. Canadian accessories brand Matt \u0026amp Nat totally shun all animal-derived materials, so you can shop conscience-free (sorry, reader’s bank balance). These 3-inch block heeled Chelsea boots caught our eye, and certainly do away with any preconceptions that vegan shoes can’t be ethical, comfortable and stylish. In fact, the company’s motto is live beautifully, in more ways than one. The Peta-approved Kalistas have a sophisticated pointed toe and are made from black imitation leather, which you’d never know wasn’t the real deal. They pull on easily thanks to a smart elasticated ankle panel and came up true to size, while the gum rubber sole is hard-wearing enough to see you through those long days dashing between meetings – and finally to the pub afterwards!Every woman needs a reliable pair of black stiletto heels, be it for work, play or both. These faux leather beauties from Brighton-based vegan footwear brand Beyond Skin were recommended to us by a vegan pal who was overjoyed to find some plastic-made shoes that didn’t rub and give her blisters (it doesn’t give as well as leather does, though). Handmade in Spain, they have pointed toes, a breathable faux leather lining made from recycled materials and a heel of roughly 9cm. Peta has given them the thumbs up, so you can strut down the corridor feeling ethically awesome. No wonder Oscar-winning actor Natalie Portman is one of many famous fans. Some sizes may be out of stock online but we’ve been assured that they’ll be back in shortly, with pre-orders sent out in early March – so don’t panic!M\u0026ampS deserves a shout-out as a high street store with a huge range of vegan shoes that aren’t just kind to animals, but well-made and chic too. We were drawn to these metal trim loafers, which come in cheery cherry red or classic black and offer women with broader feet a wide fit option. The man-made material mimics suede (so be careful in rainy weather) and has an elegant check lining. They’re an absolute steal at just £25 a pair, and so comfy you’ll forget to take them off when you get home from a long day’s slog. The only downside is that there are no half sizes – if in doubt size up and grab some insoles.Roll back to the Seventies with these laid-back corduroy kicks from Californian footwear favourite Toms. Though not a vegan brand per se, the company offers an extensive range of shoes that are. These sneakers, inspired by the Sunshine State’s seaside towns, shot straight to the top of our must have list as they tick our three boxes: ethical, comfortable and cool. They’re also not like any shoes we’ve spotted elsewhere, so expect compliments from admiring strangers on the street. Though blissfully lightweight to wear with a cushioned insole, they’re also sturdy thanks to a rubber sole. Our faves are the turquoise, but the spicy red ones are hot too. Catch ‘em while they’re 40 per cent off in the sale and you could even justify buying both, especially as for every pair sold, Toms gives another to an underprivileged child. Go for your usual size.Have you lusted after this classic three-eye shoe with its trademark yellow stitching for years while bemoaning its lack of vegan credentials?

They pull on easily thanks to a smart elasticated ankle panel and came up true to size, while the gum rubber sole is hard-wearing enough to see you through those long days dashing between meetings – and finally to the pub afterwards!Every woman needs a reliable pair of black stiletto heels, be it for work, play or both. These faux leather beauties from Brighton-based vegan footwear brand Beyond Skin were recommended to us by a vegan pal who was overjoyed to find some plastic-made shoes that didn’t rub and give her blisters (it doesn’t give as well as leather does, though). Handmade in Spain, they have pointed toes, a breathable faux leather lining made from recycled materials and a heel of roughly 9cm. Peta has given them the thumbs up, so you can strut down the corridor feeling ethically awesome. No wonder Oscar-winning actor Natalie Portman is one of many famous fans. Some sizes may be out of stock online but we’ve been assured that they’ll be back in shortly, with pre-orders sent out in early March – so don’t panic!M\u0026ampS deserves a shout-out as a high street store with a huge range of vegan shoes that aren’t just kind to animals, but well-made and chic too. We were drawn to these metal trim loafers, which come in cheery cherry red or classic black and offer women with broader feet a wide fit option. The man-made material mimics suede (so be careful in rainy weather) and has an elegant check lining. They’re an absolute steal at just £25 a pair, and so comfy you’ll forget to take them off when you get home from a long day’s slog. The only downside is that there are no half sizes – if in doubt size up and grab some insoles.Roll back to the Seventies with these laid-back corduroy kicks from Californian footwear favourite Toms. Though not a vegan brand per se, the company offers an extensive range of shoes that are. These sneakers, inspired by the Sunshine State’s seaside towns, shot straight to the top of our must have list as they tick our three boxes: ethical, comfortable and cool. They’re also not like any shoes we’ve spotted elsewhere, so expect compliments from admiring strangers on the street. Though blissfully lightweight to wear with a cushioned insole, they’re also sturdy thanks to a rubber sole. Our faves are the turquoise, but the spicy red ones are hot too. Catch ‘em while they’re 40 per cent off in the sale and you could even justify buying both, especially as for every pair sold, Toms gives another to an underprivileged child. Go for your usual size.App wont pair with left shoe, the top review reads.\u0026nbspPaired with sneakers right after unboxing then completely crashed after last update.Why Nike thinks the future of its stores is an appAnother reviewer wrtes: whenever I try connecting my shoes, it says error try again or it says it\u0027s already connected with another pair of shoes.Most complain that the app has broken on the left shoe specifically, while the right shoe continues to work.The iOS version of the app is still working, suggesting the problem is with the design of the Android tools.The problems appear to have arrived after Nike sent out a firmware update intended to fix problems with the shoes. Downloading and applying that caused the Android app to break.The shoes do have manual controls, meaning that people can lean down and tie them up. But a large part of the functionality is built around the fact\u0026nbspthey can be controlled through the companion app, allowing for easy tightening when needed.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company sold 7,970 homes under the scheme last year, almost half of all\u0026nbspits sales, and up from 7,682 in 2017.For each of those sales the government provided an interest-free loan to buyers, a move which critics say has\u0026nbspserved to further boost house prices and returns for\u0026nbspshareholders. Persimmon has returned\u0026nbsp£2.2bn\u0026nbspto shareholders in the past seven years.A source close to the housing minister said: “Leasehold, build quality, their leadership seemingly not getting they’re accountable to their customers\u0026nbspare all points that have been raised by the secretary of state privately.”Leasehold homes have come under increasing scrutiny as homeowners have been hit with thousands of pounds in fees to carry out repairs on their own properties.A spokesperson\u0026nbspfor the Ministry of Housing, Communities and\u0026nbspLocal Government said: “We expect all housing developers to deliver good-quality housing, to deliver it on time, and to treat purchasers of newbuild homes fairly.“Last October\u0026nbspwe announced our intention for there to be a new homes ombudsman, and we intend to introduce legislation to require developers of newbuild homes to belong to this body.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Prices for the Galaxy S10 start at £799.As the name suggests, the S10+ is essentially a plus-sized version of the S10.Measuring 6.4-inches, the S10+ features the same triple-lens setup on the rear of the phone but adds another lens to the front.It can also hold an incredible\u0026nbsp1.5 terabytes of data – 500GB more than its nearest rival (the Galaxy Note9) – if its 512GB expandable memory is utilised.The battery on the S10+ is also enormous, though without real-world testing it\u0027s difficult to say how far this will go in an average user\u0027s day.Up to 12GB of RAM makes this smartphone more powerful than most modern laptops.Prices for the Galaxy S10+ start at £899The Galaxy S10 5G is huge – and not only because of its 6.7-inch frame.Its real significance comes in its support for 5G, the next-generation mobile network that will define communications for the next decade.This phone will appeal to anyone wanting to see what this new world might look like, though it\u0027s likely going to be at least a year before 5G rolls out on any significant scale.In terms of general specs, the Galaxy S10 5G is most similar to the Galaxy S10, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce a price or exact\u0026nbsprelease date for the Galaxy S10 5G, though it will likely be coming at some point in the summer.While some may be questioning what the point of a folding phone is, others are heralding the Galaxy Fold as the future of smartphones.Like the S10 5G, this is a phone for early adopters, with future generations likely to iron out any kinks that may arise from such a radically new technology.It comes with 512GB of internal storage as standard, 12GB of RAM and an incredible six cameras.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce the cost of the Galaxy Fold in the UK, but with prices in the US set at $1,980 and €2,000 in Europe, British buyers can expect to pay around £1,600.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Liberal Democrats have led the campaign for a people’s vote. We have campaigned for it, we have marched for it and we will vote for it.”With dissatisfaction over Brexit having sparked several Tory and Labour MPs to quit their party and form the Independent Group, Sir Vince said he has been speaking to “many of these now independent MPs” and that they have “much in common” with his party.Created with Sketch.

But if parliament rejects that deal, then an extension will be necessary and the wording of that amendable motion will be crucial.”Created with Sketch.How Brexit will affect your travel to Europe Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British passports that expire after 29 March 2019 will continue to be valid as UK travel documents, but will lose the power that comes with being a European Union passport – notably the right of free movement within the EU27.You will still be able to travel to the EU with your pet after Brexit, but it could well get more complicated depending on the status that the European Union decide to apply.

This would be the most grievous error that politicians could commit“PM statement does what is needed to prevent no deal exit on 29 March and enables MPs to forge cross-party consensus on new way forward if PM’s deal does not succeed on 12 March. No need now for Cooper-Letwin Bill.”Conservative MP Nick Boles, another member behind the push to take no deal off the table, said he was “gratified” the PM had backed down.He added: “This is a victory for parliament. We will lay amendments to her motion this afternoon and seek confirmation of her commitments from ministers during tomorrow’s debate.”The prime minister left no doubt that she does not want a delay and still hopes to obtain assurances from Brussels which will win MPs’ approval for her withdrawal agreement in a fortnight’s time.But Ms May’s official spokesman refused to be drawn on other key aspects of the government’s approach if her deal is rejected –\u0026nbspfor example, would the government whip MPs to support no deal or not in that instance, or would it whip them to support a delay.They did indicate that it is Ms May’s preference to delay Brexit no later than June, if she must do it at all, in order to avoid the UK having to take part in European parliament elections, but they could not rule out MPs forcing a longer setback.Some Conservative Brexiteer backbenchers appeared relaxed over Ms May’s announcement, claiming that even if Brexit is delayed the default position at the end would still be a no-deal Brexit.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair\u0026nbspof the European Research Group of Leave-backing Conservative MPs, instead attacked colleagues who had been behind the drive of trying to overturn the result of the 2016 referendum.He said: “My suspicion is that any delay to Brexit is a plot to stop Brexit. This would be the most grievous error that politicians could commit.”But fellow Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen MP was angry that Remain-backing cabinet ministers had not resigned when they opposed the prime minister’s approach, as Eurosceptics like Boris Johnson and David Davis had.He said: “It appears that Leavers moan and leave the cabinet, but Remainers moan and remain. It’s very selective collective responsibility.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Just holding out possibility of a short delay, too short for a #peoplesvote” she tweeted.Significantly, the prime minister refused to say whether she would “argue for no-deal or argue for extension”, if her deal is thrown out again on 12 March.Labour’s Yvette Cooper hinted she would continue to press her amendment tomorrow, to legally compel Ms May to seek an Article 50 extension if her deal is not approved.Suggesting the legal force was crucial, Ms Cooper warned: “Promised votes have been pulled before, Commons motions have been ignored before.

Tomorrow, there will be an amendment in the name of the leader of the opposition setting out the party’s Brexit demands, notably a permanent customs union. That amendment won’t mention a referendum.The Labour Party is no longer in favour of keeping all options on the table, including a public vote:\u0026nbspnow it supports a public vote, which all its leading spokespeople accept means a referendum, with Remain as one of the options. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.There are caveats and cavils. The wording of the statement is that a referendum is “to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit”. That might suggest the policy ceases to apply if parliament finds another way to avoid Brexit. If, for example, the House of Commons votes on 12 and 14 March to reject the prime minister’s revised deal, and to delay Brexit, would Corbyn still be pressing for a referendum?\u0026nbspHas the forward march of Corbynism been halted?Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, insisted on Channel 4 News yesterday that Labour would continue to support a referendum even if Brexit is delayed. But until there is what Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, calls a “credible Leave option” – that is, a Brexit deal approved by parliament – it is hard to see what the choices in a referendum would be.The new Labour policy appears to be that there should be a referendum after parliament has approved a deal.\u0026nbspThe more serious obstacle to a new referendum, however, is that it is not (yet) supported by a majority of MPs – even with Corbyn throwing the weight of the Labour front bench behind it.\u0026nbspBy my calculation the maximum support is currently 288 MPs, which is 31 short of a majority. The problem for advocates of giving the British people the Final Say is that there are more Labour rebels on this subject\u0026nbspwho are opposed to a referendum than there are Conservatives who are in favour.\u0026nbspFinal Say supporters such as Ben Bradshaw, the Labour MP for Exeter, insist that there are more Conservatives, including ministers, who would back it when it comes to the crunch. On the other hand, there are probably more Labour MPs who have doubts about a referendum but who have yet to be flushed out.\u0026nbspCynics suggest that Corbyn is not entirely sincere in his support for a referendum that he has held back for so long and is now appearing to back it only to try to head off further Labour defections – and safe in the knowledge that it could not get through the House of Commons.\u0026nbspOn the other hand, however, a referendum must be one of the ways of breaking the deadlock if Brexit is delayed. And it would be hard for Corbyn ever to retreat from the position that he adopted at 5.27pm yesterday.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

This could result in business failure, andor relocation to Ireland with knock-on consequences for the Northern Ireland economy and unemployment.”And food prices\u0026nbspare “likely” to increase in the wake of a no-deal exit, the papers said.Much of the information and analysis contained in the paper, released in response to an amendment tabled by the now-Independent Group MPs Chuka Umunna and Anna Soubry, was already in the public domain.But Mr Umunna said it painted “a disastrous picture of the catastrophe which would befall our country if there is a no-deal Brexit”.He continued: “In light of what she knows, it is utterly irresponsible for the prime minister to keep a no-deal Brexit on the table given the extreme damage it will do.“These papers set out how food prices will rise, we may see panic buying, there will be severe disruption at the border, and jobs and livelihoods would immediately be put at risk.“Today she told the House of Commons she is listening, but MPs have passed a motion rejecting a no-deal Brexit and yet she refuses to request an extension of the Article 50 process in order to stop no-deal happening.We’ll tell you what’s true.

His party called for fresh elections in four states: Yobe, Zamfara, Nasarawa and Borno.\u0026nbspMr Abubakar’s party has rejected the tallies announced so far as “incorrect and unacceptable”. Mr Buhari’s party has said the opposition was trying to discredit the returns from Saturday’s election.The accusations have increased tensions in a vote marred by outbreaks of violence,\u0026nbspdelays and\u0026nbsplogistical glitches.Observers from the Economic Community of West African States, the African Union and the United Nations appealed to all parties to await the official results, expected later this week, before filing complaints.The candidate with the most votes nationwide is declared winner as long as they have at least one-quarter of the vote in two-thirds of Nigeria‘s 36 states and the capital, Abuja. Otherwise there is a second-round run-off.Mr Buhari has already secured enough votes to meet both requirements, a tally by Reuters showed. The BBC reported that at just under 35 per cent, turnout was the lowest in 20 years.Nigeria is also Africa’s largest economy and biggest oil producer.Additional reporting by agenciesWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Now the US financial regulator is alleging that Mr Musk broke the terms of that agreement with a tweet on 19 February which showed an aerial photo of thousands of new Tesla vehicles and said the company would make about 500,000 cars in 2019.A few hours later, Mr Musk corrected his statement, saying he meant that Tesla had started to manufacture cars at a weekly rate that would translate into 500,000 cars during a year-long period, but not necessarily for the calendar year 2019.Mr Musk acknowledged he did not get company approval for the tweet, according to the SEC.In his defence, Mr Musk said he did not think his tweet needed clearance because he was basing it on information that had been disclosed in late January.Car manufacturing statistics can affect stock prices of carmakers, however both 19 February tweets occurred while the US stock market was closed and Tesla’s stock rose by less than 1 per cent the next day.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos doesn\u0027t think Elon Musk should colonise MarsTesla speeding at 128mph before crash almost cut other car in halfTesla driver filmed \u0027sleeping at the wheel\u0027 of semi-autonomous carWhy Elon Musk can\u0027t make Tesla profitableAccording to the SEC, Tesla’s legal team realised Mr Musk may have crossed a line with his tweet.The agency said a Tesla lawyer “immediately arranged to meet with Musk and draft the corrective statement that Musk tweeted out over four hours later” after the tweet was posted.The entrepreneur could now face potential fines or even jail time if he is found to be in contempt.AP contributed to this reportWe’ll tell you what’s true.

They agree a sortie of multiple Indian aircraft crossed the “line of control” into Pakistan-administered Kashmir, although not by much, and fired towards a town called Balakot.They agree\u0026nbspthe operation was conducted in a matter of moments – an incursion of just one-and-a-half minutes in total, according to Indian defence sources – and that Pakistan’s air force scrambled its own jets in response.And that’s about it. For while India’s foreign secretary issued a statement describing the Tuesday morning air raid as a successful mission to avert an imminent terror attack, Pakistan’s armed forces insisted it did nothing more than scuff up some dirt and knock over a few trees. No infrastructure damaged, and no loss of life.Neither side is yet to prove their point. India may yet, as it did during a similar incident in 2016, produce satellite images which it claims show the destruction. One government minister said the operation had “completely destroyed” the largest training camp belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), the militant group behind Kashmir’s deadliest car bombing earlier this month. It’s the sort of damage that before-and-after imagery should easily pick up.Created with Sketch.Fire on the streets as Indians react to the Pulwama bombing attack Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Indian muslims in Mumbai burn posters of Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan, center, and Hafiz Saeed, chief of Pakistani religious group Jamaat-ud-Dawa, during a protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy in Kashmir that killed at least 40Policeman walk past vehicles set on fire in Jammu by a mob during a protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoyVehicles are set on fire in Jammu during protests following the attackIndian Muslims hold a protest in Mumbai the day after the terrorist attack Mourners gather for the cremation of Central Reserve Police Force soldier Mahesh Yadav, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirProtestors in Jammu throw stones during a clash between communities while protesting against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy that killed at least 40 in KashmirIndian police men keep vigil next to a barbed wire fencing during the third day of curfew in JammuIndia\u0027s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party workers  in Mumbai burn a symbolic effigy of Pakistan as part of protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy in Kashmir, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) soldiers pay tribute to their colleague Maneswar Basumatary, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirIndian army soldiers patrol during a curfew in Jammu on February 16, 2019A relative of Indian Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) trooper Sudip Biswas mourns over his coffin at Kolkata airportMourners gather for the cremation of Central Reserve Police Force soldier Mahesh Yadav, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirIndian muslims in Mumbai burn posters of Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan, center, and Hafiz Saeed, chief of Pakistani religious group Jamaat-ud-Dawa, during a protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy in Kashmir that killed at least 40Policeman walk past vehicles set on fire in Jammu by a mob during a protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoyVehicles are set on fire in Jammu during protests following the attackIndian Muslims hold a protest in Mumbai the day after the terrorist attack Mourners gather for the cremation of Central Reserve Police Force soldier Mahesh Yadav, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirProtestors in Jammu throw stones during a clash between communities while protesting against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy that killed at least 40 in KashmirIndian police men keep vigil next to a barbed wire fencing during the third day of curfew in JammuIndia\u0027s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party workers  in Mumbai burn a symbolic effigy of Pakistan as part of protest against Thursday\u0027s attack on a paramilitary convoy in Kashmir, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) soldiers pay tribute to their colleague Maneswar Basumatary, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirIndian army soldiers patrol during a curfew in Jammu on February 16, 2019A relative of Indian Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) trooper Sudip Biswas mourns over his coffin at Kolkata airportMourners gather for the cremation of Central Reserve Police Force soldier Mahesh Yadav, who was killed in Thursday\u0027s bombing in KashmirPakistan’s foreign ministry said its side of the border was open for domestic and international journalists alike to themselves check for any signs of damage. Indeed, the ministry\u0026nbspsaid it was taking independent military observers to inspect the scene.But where to look? In the confusion after the event, the two sides could not even agree on which Balakot had been targeted – one in Pakistan-administered Kashmir or, and which would be a more serious incursion, one in Pakistan proper. Specifically, in the region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa – prime minister Imran Khan’s home province.Here in India, the government has been preparing both practically and rhetorically for an operation like Tuesday morning’s. Since the 14 February Pulwama bombing, the government\u0026nbsphas collected statements of solidarity and support for action in the face of terror\u0026nbspfrom more than 48 other countries. And in the last few days, security forces in India’s Jammu and Kashmir have pre-emptively rounded up more than 300 suspected separatist agitators.Narendra Modi had promised a “jaw-breaking” response to that car bombing in Pulwama,\u0026nbspcarried out by a young local man but prepared by JeM,\u0026nbspwhich killed 40 paramilitary police officers, and in this context made a substantial retaliatory attack seem inevitable – even justified.In his statement, foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale said the sortie only hit terrorist assets and thus was not an act of aggression against either the Pakistani military or civilians. He creatively described it as “non-military pre-emptive action”.India raises customs duty on goods from Pakistan to 200 per centIndia says Pakistan had ‘direct hand’ in Kashmir bomb attackIndia warns Pakistan of ‘jaw-breaking reply’ after suicide bomb attackWhat is Kashmir Solidarity Day and how is it observed?Pakistan does not view it that way, though. It has not only denied any state involvement in Pulwama, but demanded India provide evidence for the claim that JeM prepared the attack from Pakistani soil.The country’s own foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, said the airstrikes were\u0026nbspa “grave aggression”, and prime minister\u0026nbspImran Khan vowed that “Pakistan shall respond at the time and place of its choosing”.At the same time it played down the impact of the airstrikes. Mr Khan said that “once again\u0026nbspthe Indian government has resorted to a self-serving, reckless and fictitious claim”, suggesting\u0026nbspthe Indian account was “for domestic consumption” in the runup to imminent elections.He is not the only one pointing out that an escalating conflict with Pakistan plays well for Mr Modi and his nationalist BJP in the polls.A Reuters survey showed a marked uptick in support for Mr Modi in the immediate aftermath of the 14 February attack. He was, after all, swept to power in 2014 at least partly thanks to the image he portrayed of himself as a strong leader.Sure enough, it wasn’t long after news of the airstrikes broke on Tuesday that videos started doing the rounds on social media of jingoistic displays of Indian flag-waving, anti-Pakistan chants and the burning of Pakistan flags. One analyst who did not wish to be named told me he did not believe a surgical strike had been necessary and that it had been “orchestrated for the election”.Another defence expert, Dr Gopalan Balachandran, said the airstrikes were “clearly motivated by the JeM attack in Kashmir”. He said the death toll in Pulwama had been “intolerable” to most Indians, and that Mr Modi “needed to show that he was doing something about it”.Since 14 February, a number of opposition parties have broached the topic of the BJP making political hay out of the Pulwama attack. West Bengal’s chief minister Mamata Banerjee went as far as accusing the Modi administration of wanting to instil “war hysteria”, leading the BJP’s state president to accuse her of making “baseless allegations to score political brownie points” herself.It would be too soon for anyone to do the same on Tuesday night. Foreign minister Sushma Swaraj emerged from a cross-party security briefing to state that “all parties in one voice praised the security forces and supported the government’s anti-terror operations”.So what next for Pakistan? Mr Khan has called for both houses of the country’s parliament to sit on Wednesday to discuss the situation, and he has also summoned an emergency meeting of the National Command Authority\u0026nbsp– the body that oversees Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal.Amid the high-stakes sabre-rattling, Mr Khan has little option but to offer a military retaliation, analysts say.In ordinary circumstances it would need to be “proportionate” – but does that mean destroying a base of 300 Indian paramilitary officers, or a copse of trees? Before the country\u0026nbspcan decide on a response to today’s events, Pakistan will need to settle on – and convince others – of its version of exactly what occurred.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Likewise, consistently receiving less than you need to because you are paying back an advance can push people over the edge and into destitution.To succeed, Universal Credit needs to raise the incomes of those locked in poverty and ensure that work is a route to a better le. Without further reform, its potential risks being unfulfilled.The best immediate step the Government should take would be to lt the freeze on working age benefits this April.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the Government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. JRF also want jobcentres to better use the hidden pot called the Flexible Support Fund to help Brits with their childcare payments upfront so Brits dont go into thousands of pounds of debt going back to work.They highlighted the thoughts of both people on Universal Credit and work coaches in their new report.Research from Britain Thinks revealed that working parents saw Universal Credit as contributing towards their poor standards of living, and not helping them.Many wanted to be able to keep more of their hard-earned cash rather than being hit by the taper rate, and felt trapped by their circumstances.When the couple moved onto the new benefit system in September their £ a month benefits were immediately stopped, leaving them unable to pay their rent.The Peterborough couple, who’ve been living in their current home for a year now, claim they have nowhere  to gothey are evicted and will have to be put in temporary accommodation, at a cost of £ a week to the city council.Its a disgusting situation to be in because you know its going to happen but youre absolutely powerless to do anything about it, Amanda told The Sun.We have no savings, no one to fall back on and we struggle to be able to afford the rent now that we’re in debt.If were are relocated to a completely dferent area then Brian will have to give up his job but I thought the whole point of Universal Credit was to get people into work  It makes no sense.A DWP spokesperson said that the scheme works for the vast majority of people.They added: Universal Credit reduces gradually as people’s income increases, which means they’re always better off in work."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000470219006.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jeremy corbyn hadnshake shamima begum lawyer","story":"Mohammed Akunjee posted a picture of him meeting the Labour leader at Islington Assembly Hall on his Facebook page in .It comes a day after Jeremy Corbyn stunned Westminster by saying by saying Ms Begum should be allowed toto the UK.Separately yesterday it emerged Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell claimed in  that Brits who fought for the Israeli state against Palestine should lose their citizenship.Mr Akunjee, who has been representing Ms Begum and her family over her attempt toto the UK, has sparked outrage over a string of comments.Earlier this week he attacked Britain for denying Ms Begum rights that were given to Nazi war criminals.He also complained that Ms Begum was traumatised by her treatment and compared her mental state to soldiers “in shellshock” during the First World War.The controversial lawyer has also said Mrs May had “Nazi blood in her veins” and has urged Muslims not to cooperate with the Government’s anti-extremism Prevent programme.Mr Akunjee previously called for former Home Secretary to be sent to a “concentration camp”.In an interview with The Times earlier this week Mr Akunjee said: “The Nazis had the Nuremberg trials.They were given due process.

We should leave the EU and forge a new path in the world.It was put to a referendum and the rest, as they say, is history.For some, though, the result of the ­referendum is not history. It’s something they are desperate to re-run.Calls for an extension, a delay or even a second referendum are persistent — but so too is mydetermination, and the ­determination of this Government, to deliver on the will of the first one.Democracy is not about trying again until you get the result you want.It’s about compromise and accepting that while we might disagree with each other, we should respect each other’s views.That need for compromise is precisely why we continue to negotiate with the EU. The Prime Minister is fighting hard to make sure we leave with a good deal on March .That determination is the reason I believe that the Conservative Party is the only party delivering in the national interest.The Prime Minister has made clear through her actions that whether you voted Leave or Remain, the deal she seeks will look to bring everyone back together.Whether you are someone who can’t wait to see us leave the EU, or whether you wish the result of the referendum had been dferent — we all, each of us, just want the best for the UK.We have a bright future ahead and one in which the UK will continue to grow as a force for good in the world.The pressure isn’t all on Parliament.The EU needs to come to the table in the spirit of compromise too.It would be the most illogical act of senseless harmthe EU refuses to accept that the UK Parliament will not be trapped in a backstop and instead pushes us to leave with No Deal, thereby ­creating the exact problem with the Northern Ireland border they claim they want to avoid.As far as our current ­negotiation is concerned, we are well into extra time.As Leader of the House, I am responsible for passing the legislation necessary for our exit from the EU.We have a lot to do before March  but I remain confident thatwe resolve the backstop, we will be able to pass the Meaningful Vote and crack on with that vital ­legislation.We are so close to the ­finishing line, so my plea to politicians here and in ­Brussels is: Please don’t snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The EU must lt its eyes and look beyond the current frustrations and towards the close friendship we all want in the future.The Labour Party must carry out the wishes of the majority of its own ­voters, who wanted to leave the EU.And my own colleagues on the ­Conservative benches must not make the perfect the enemy of the good.Don’t hold the PM to ­ransom at such a critical point.Instead, we must hold our nerve and push through.  We must hold fast to the reality of the PM’s deal — that it delivers us a clean exit from the EU and all of its ­institutions while at the same time ­offering a close trading and security partnership that addresses the hopes and aspirations of many in our country who voted Remain.So the prize is great — and it’s all of our futures.Let’s come together and, with one final heave, we can get the PM’s deal over the line and begin to look ­forward, not ­backward.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

dirty clothing and bloodstained underwear when she arrived at her school in Albuquerque, New Mexico.Dad James Stewart’s trial started on Monday and the prosecutor started to outline evidence against him.The -year-old has been accused of forcing his daughter to be sexual abused by others in exchange for drugs.The court heard that alarmed teachers tried to help the little girl by giving her money to clean up, but she still had poor hygiene.Collin Brennan said: “There’s going to be testimony from witnesses that they witnessed hickeys on the girl.“We’ll talk about instances where she’d actually show up to school in high heels and makeup.As reported by KRQUE, Brennan continued: “These teachers and administrators, they’re trying to helpout even with their own money and still she ed the next day, bad hygiene, improper clothing.“The evidence will show that now only he permitto show up to school unfed, dirty.“It’ll show he taught her how to pick pocket, but it will also show that he used her in a sexual manner to receive narcotics.”Stewart denies the claims he forced his child to be sexually abused by others.His lawyer Stephanie Gulley argued the three DNA samples found on the girls’ underwear by police – which includes one sample belonging to Stewart –are too small to prove any wrongdoing.They insist there is no evidence to support the allegations against him.The alarm was raised after a school employee contacted authorities to report suspicions the student was being trafficked.The unidentied schoolgirl told forensic interviewers her dad made her inappropriately touch his friends in exchange for “weed and pipes and stuff”, as reported by the Albuquerque Journal.She told the interviewer: “I keep saying I don’t want to, but he…forces me to.”A separate court document alleges Stewart “would use the profits from the panhandling to support his narcotics habit”.The girl is expected to testy this week.Stewart and his we Teri Sanchez were arrested in May .He denies the charges of promoting prostitution, child abuse, criminal sexual contact of a minor, human trafficking and child abuse.Sanchez has been charged with child abuse and contributing to the delinquency of a

Fernandina Tortoise was found last month on the remote island of Fernandina in the Galapagos after the species had not been spotted since .News of this historic discovery was first downplayed because it was originally believed she would need a male partner in order to prevent the species from going extinct.Forrest Galante, the biologist and Animal Planet presenter who discovered the reptile, said the female could still save her species because of her ability to store fertile sperm until she needs it.The tortoise, now named Fern, is about  years old and when she gains weight from being in captivity may surprise conservationists by laying eggsshe has the decades-old sperm inside her.Galante told the : “Its incredible, but female tortoises are able to withhold viable sperm within them for decades, then produce offspring without having to mate a second time.“Nobody knows anything about the Fernandina tortoise because it’s the first one ever found, but given the harshness of the environment and the uniqueness of the animal, it’s certainly possible that she is able to hold viable sperm for  years.”They are able to move the sperm through contractions in and out of the storage structures.Some female tortoises can store sperm from more than one male and can then choose, which sperm she wants to fertilise her eggs with.Animals with lower body temperatures can store sperm better because of their reduced metabolic rates.Fern was captured during an expedition funded by US TV channel Animal Planet for the series Extinct or Alive, which Forrest presents.He went to the remote island of Fernandina, about miles from Ecuador’s mainland and has the La Cumbre volcano – one of the most active in the world.Galante and his team from the Galapagos National Park and the US NGO Galapagos Conservancy began the expedition with a -hour boat ride from Santa Cruz, the capital of the Galapagos Islands.Within hours of arriving, Galante found tortoise poo and an active bedding site.Fern was found completely alone and had been surviving on a green patch surrounded by lava flows.Galante said there is no way to tellshe has been alone her whole le orshe lived most of her le with another tortoise.No other male was found with Fern.The only other tortoise of the same breed to be found was male and was found dead at the turn of the century.Galante added now it’s time to find a male suitor to prevent the species from dying out, but she could lay eggs at any moment.He added: “We could mate her with another male from another nearby island, so you would have a tortoise which is very genetically close to the Fernandina tortoise and aesthetically identical.Or she could surprise us by using sperm she’s kept inside her for decades and just start laying eggs. That would be just incredible.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000472107626-e1551219962286.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"judge lonely paedos can meet","story":"Barry Cutler, , was jailed in  alongside other members of the now-defunct Paedophile Information Exchange, which promoted sex with minors.A sexual offences prevention order bans him from meeting or communicating with others who have similar convictions.But Cutler, of Beckenham, South London, claims because of his “social phobia disorder” he has no pals who are not perverts.He has now won a legal fight to contact Anthony Zalewski, an ex-PIE member with two child sex convictions.Judge Nicholas Cooke, who agreed at the Old Bailey to amend the order, said the two men had common ­interests unconnected to offending.He said Cutler, jailed for indecent photos, was “a sad figure who lacks insight into the damage done by child pornography”.Peter Saunders, of the ­Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: “It beggars belief.

But no longer.In recent months Big Ben has stood silent. Officially, it has been muted for repairs but you could not be blamed for wonderingthere was a dferent reason.Has this most resonant symbol of parliamentary democracy been gagged — had its clacker nicked — while our appalling, promise-shredding, treasonous politicians plot to overturn the  referendum’s whacking vote to leave the European Union Almost three years ago the voters gave MPs a clear instruction: Get us out of the EU. Unbelievably, the MPs are refusing to obey.Whatever tricksy waffle they spout, be in no doubt about this. The parliamentary class is telling voters to get stuffed.The last  hours have seen British politics sink to a new, squalid, guttering low.In clear daylight the express will of the people is being violated.Democratic honesty is being casually abandoned by a knot of pro-Brussels obsessives who think they can do whatever they like. And they suppose we won’t notice!Cabinet ministers yesterday tarted their Remainer consciences like dollybirds flashing their bits on Blackpool beach.Led by Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, they threatened to resignTheresa May did not do their bidding and delay our departure date from Europe.Oooh, look at us, their blatant behaviour said. Look at our importance and our Europhile goodness. All this while they accused pro-Brexit MPs of being “extremists”.Is it really extremist to respect the biggest vote in British history In any normal circumstances, a Prime Minister would have turned to Rudd and her fellow drama queens Greg Clark and David Gauke and said: “OK, resign. If you won’t support the Government, you can kiss goodbye to your six-figure salary, your free limos and all the other perks.”But Mrs May, pitiably weak, tolerated their rebellion and trotted off to the Commons to accept Brexit may be delayed.It wasn’t just Rudd, non- entity Gauke and Clark, a former SDP supporter who has resented the Leave vote from day one.A trio of lower-ranking ministerial numpties put their names to a newspaper article saying they would quit unless Mrs May obeyed their pro-EU agenda.These connivers included an insufferably moist specimen called Richard Harrington, who is barely a familiar name in his Watford constituency let alone in national politics.Even a premier as puny as Mrs May should have had the backbone to tell Harrington to fetch his coat. But no. He was allowed to keep his job.Things are just as bad in the Labour party, where ­Jeremy Corbyn has casually scrapped his  manesto promise to respect the result of the EU referendum.Now he says he wants a second referendum. You thought the one thing loonytunes Corbyn had going for him was that he said what he believed A manesto should matter. It should be a solemn undertaking to the voters about what politicians will do.But Corbyn, supposed beardie prophet of ethics, now snootily thinks we voted the wrong way in the referendum and must capitulate to the European empire, ditching the national independence .million voters demanded.Why the hell are these people in politicsthey think so little of the voterswho opted for Leave Theirs is the behaviour of a tyrannous clique whose “delay” to our departure helps only their fellow technocrats in the European Commission.And that’s what it’s all about. They feel a greater kinship with their fellow elitists on the Continent than they do with working-class British voters.The likes of Greg Clark and Amber Rudd and their slippery pal Philip Hammond looked smug yesterday when Mrs May announced the possibility of a delay to Brexit.For them, it’s a game, a ploy, a bid to show that they — and not the unwashed electorate — run the show.Can they not see the dangers  Respect for Westminster, already whacked by the expenses scandal, will take another terrible hit. People will look at the wriggling and the grand- standing and the lies and procrastinating blether of the last day and a half and will conclude that our Parliament is now a place that scorns its electors.Some of you may have greater faith.Some of you may say: “Brexit will prevail in the end”, albeit in diluted form.But eventhat is true, what are we to think in future of the House of Commons Things have reached the stage, I am truly sorry to say, that I now find I hate the very sight of Big Ben and the Palace of Westminster.It is no longer, for me, the proud cockpit of our national le.It has become a nest of aggressive, desperate elitists prepared to do anything to save their greasy grasp on public opinion.They lie.

The Labour leader called Hezbollah his “friends” during a controversial parliamentary meeting with them in .Mike Gapes – who quit as a Labour MP last week – said yesterday’s statement proved Jeremy Corbyn was “unfit” to be Prime Minister.Sajid Javid extended a ban on Hezbollah’s military wing to its political arm on Monday – saying it was vital to “protect the British people”.Jewish groups had urged Ministers to close the loophole as it allowed Hezbollah’s flag to be flown on Britain’s streets during marches.The Home Secretary insisted the Lebanon-based Shia group was continuing in its attempts to destabilise the fragile situation in the Middle East.But Labour yesterday claimed Ministers didn’t have the evidence to back up their move and the decision would strain diplomatic relations with Lebanon.A Labour spokesperson said: “The Home Office has previously ruled that there was not sufficient evidence that the political wing of Hezbollah fell foul of proscription criteria, a position confirmed by ministers in the House of Commons last year. Ministers have not yet provided any clear evidence to suggest this has changed.”The spokesperson added: “The Home Secretary must now demonstrate that this decision was taken in an objective and impartial way, and driven by clear and new evidence, not by his leadership ambitions.”Home Office aide Racheal Maclean said Labour’s stance was “shocking”. She said: “It’s shocking but not at all surprising that Corbyn fails to stand up to appalling terrorists and anti-semites who beyond any doubt seek the destruction of Israel and their allies.”Labour’s London Mayor Sadiq Khan on Monday said the ban was “long overdue”.Tory deputy chair James Cleverly last night stormed: “There has long been cross-party cooperation on national security, but Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party continues to reject the values that once united people across the political ide.“His refusal to back our decision to ban the antisemitic terrorist organisation Hizballah is yet another example of why even ex-Labour MPs think he is not fit to lead the Labour Party, let alone the country.”Labour last night said it would not oppose Sajid Javid’s “overall” motion which also called for the proscription of Jamaat Nusrat al Islam Wall Muslimin and Ansaroul Islam.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I just can’t take it anymore. I need her to be gone from here and moved on to somewhere better.”After Emily claimed she had been forced to move out, The Sun Online called in Hull-based exorcist Ralph to help, and stuck around to watch the spooky series of events.Emily moved into her Chelmsford flat seven years ago and, at first, she noticed items were moved around the house.Then she started to feel an icy sensation in her leg when she sat on the sofa, assomeone cold was sitting next to her.But, she claims, the strange activity didn’t become a nuisance until she started sitting in a dferent chair in the evening.“After that she started acting dferently,” she adds. “She upped the ante and one day when I was in the bathroom, where I believe Joyce died, she flushed the toilet over and over again. She now does that a lot.“She’s smashed cups on the kitchen floor and thrown things about. She’s taken ornaments, including the beautul angel wings that hang on the wall which she tried to flush down the toilet.“I had to start going to bed in a hat to stop her from pulling my hair out and hitting my ears. She’s caused pain in my hip and head, and stolen things from my flat never to be seen again.”Emily, a practising Christian, called in local a priest to help by performing an exorcism, but Joyce continued to terrorise her. At her wits end, she move away to the Travelodge only for the spirit to follow.I could feel her presence in the room, she says. It felt like I just couldnt escape her.“Now whatever I have to do to make her go I will do it - I just want her out.“I want her to leave and go onto the next place, wherever that may be. I trust Ralph and will do whatever needs to happen.”While Emily thought she was going to be stuck with the horrible ghost for le, exorcist Ralph had come to assure her that this spirit was far from evil, and wouldn’t be dficult to sort out.Preferring the term negotiator to exorcist, Ralph claims he communicates with spirits in order to perform a soul collection - moving spirits on to whatever lies beyond the grave.He performs exorcisms, a spiritual practice often associated with the Catholic Church, that sees spirits removed from homes, areas and even people by commanding them to move on.“I started seeing spirits and energies when I was a boy, as early as six years old,” Ralph explains. “So I’m very much able to clear energies, ghosts and evil spirits from homes or people.“I’ve worked with people who have contorted like in The Exorcist, dealt with walls caving in due to demons and I’ve been thrown across rooms by powerful evil forces. But that isn’t the case here.”And despite being in demand to deal with exorcisms up and down the country, Ralph normally charges no more than £ for his services, paying for his petrol to and from Hull out of this payment.Ralph explains that Emily’s pesky spirit is low level, known in his profession as a level four, and is more like an annoying child, who may be pulling her hair and smashing items in order to get attention rather than instil fear or pain.Cases like this are common for Ralph - who reveals he turns ice cold when he senses Joyces presence.“The spirit will be as frightened as we are,” Ralph assures. “We just have to give her time and a gentle persuasion - and we all need to just accept she is here and relax to help her on her way.”Standing in the bathroom, Ralph places his hands on the wall and his knuckles start turning white as he says the spirit is getting closer to him.He asks for complete silence while Emily calls Joyce forward.“Joyce, please come forward and meet us,” she confidently asks the spirit, beginning the exorcism. “We want to help you. Come on, don’t hide. Say something, dont be afraid.”Silence - apart from a bird chirping, which in itself seems spooky in the middle of the night, and a slow clunking from the shower.Ralph commands Joyce to move with him to the bedroom.Asking Emily to sit down on the bed, he closes his eyes and waves his hands through the air.He recognises another spirit in the room, Emily’s Irish father, who is apparently overlooking the process.The news is reassuring to Emily, who says she feels safer in his presence.“I call Joyce and her family to step forward,” continues Ralph. “Let all the spirits unite as one energy form, moving her out of the house as one. By the use of higher authority, I ask you to move forward.Emily continues: Im asking you to move forward, Joyce. There will be peace for both of us, we will be happier. This is what I want - and we send our love with you on your way.Ralph points to the hallway with an expression of shock, but there’s no ghost when we all turn around. Instead, he calmly explains that the suffering is finally over for Emily. Joyce is gone.“I could hear her footsteps going out of this room,” Ralph says with a smile as the exorcism concludes. He hands Emily a small vial of holy water, the pair hug and he leaves.Slightly disoriented and still shaking from the experience, a genuine smile appears on Emily’s face for the first time in months - she feels that Joyce’s presence is gone at last.Now sleeping again without her protective hat, and getting her first full nights since her horrying first encounter with the spirit, Emily says she is a testament to Ralph’s work as an exorcist.“When all this started I stopped singing - but now I can sing again,” she says.“I can’t wait to start singing and dancing around my home now that she’s gone. It’s such a relief. Finally I’ve got closure.“Ralph has truly done something amazing - I trusted him fully and I could never thank him enough. I never thought I’d get my le back, but it was all down to the exorcist.”Sadly, a week after the exorcism Emily revealed that Joyce was back.Shes not in the flat but in another part of the building, which I think is the hallway, she told us. And shes very angry.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

First Labour announced the party is prepared to back a second EU referendum. Now Theresa May has outlined a formal plan to delay Brexit. There are still a lot of unknowns, and we dont know how itll end - with huge consequences for you and your family. All the while, No Deal Brexit preparations are continuing at a cost of more than poundmillion to hard-pressed British taxpayers. So what exactly has been announced, what does it mean, and what happens next  Heres a basic guide. What has Theresa May announced today   Theresa May outlined a sht in her Brexit plans in a statement to the House of Commons. She unveiled a three-step plan that could lead to delaying Brexit . Those steps are:March : Vote on Theresa Mays Brexit deal. By this date, the government will hold a new meaningful vote on the -page Brexit deal. If it passes, Brexit happens with a deal, almost certainly on March  . If it fails, or theres no vote, move to step . March : Vote on No Deal Brexit. By this date, Theresa May will table a Commons motion asking MPs for their explicit consent to leaving the EU with no deal. If they give consent, we leave with No Deal on March . If they dont give their consent, move to step . March : Vote on delaying Brexit. On this date, MPs will hold a vote on whether to delay the date of Brexit by up to three months - to the end of June.Why has she done it now   The Prime Minister announced the major change in a desperate bid to head off a Tory revolt. Remain-backing ministers had lined up to warn theyd defy the government and vote to delay Brexit, as soon as tomorrow night. That could have forced around  ministers to resign. The Remainer Tories were prepared to back an amendment by Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin, which said MPs should get a vote on delaying Brexittheres no agreement by March . By announcing her own plan , the Prime Minister has taken control of the process. Oliver Letwin announced there is now no need for his Bill to delay Brexit because Mrs Mays statement does what is needed. Is delaying Brexit guaranteed   No. But its now more likely. Technically, we have to get through three votes before Brexit will be delayed. But the odds are on all those votes tipping towards delaying Brexit. Downing Street today insisted the focus and very strong preference remains on getting a revised Brexit deal. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox is in talks today with Brussels to revise the Irish backstop - a clause in the -page deal that could extend EU customs rules over the UK. But no big changes are expected, so the deals expected to be voted down - just as it was by a record margin in January. Then theres the vote on No Deal, but the Commons has already shown it has a majority on No Deal Brexit. There are some unknowns of course. We dont know yet how the government will whip its MPs to vote on a delay. Will they be told to back one  Or will ministers have to resignthey do   Theresa Mays Brexit deal was shattered by a record-setting -vote majority in January. Yet, whisper it, there is still a way the deal could pass. Now that shes dangling the prospect of a delay, Brexiteer Tories may feel so boxed in that they have no choice to accept Theresa Mays plan by March . Its not what they want - but it now looks like the only way to ensure Brexit happens on time on March . Of course, those Tories alone wont be enough to pass the deal. Theresa May has a tiny majority and there are plenty of Tory Remainers. But  Labour MPs showed last month theyre prepared to rebel to stop Brexit being delayed. If those forces unite, then technically, the deal could get through.  No. And MPs are furious. Theresa May insisted that even after a delay, the choices we face would remain unchanged. Leave with a deal, leave with no deal, or have no Brexit. Labour MP Stephen Doughty said: This is yet more trickery from the PM. She’s still refusing to take no deal off the table legally or otherwise no matter what Commons says or does. It’s all just her way or the highway.  Yes. Theresa May said today she would seek the shortest possible extension, and not beyond the end of June. That dates been chosen because new MEPs take their seats from July , and the UK is supposed to have no MEPs by then. Yet the motion that gets put before MPs will, crucially, be amendable, No officials said today. That means MPs could force a longer delay on the Prime Minister, and she is committed to legislating for the result. Downing Street did, however, reject reports of a -month delay - saying its not been brought up by EU leaders in talks with the Prime Minister. Does this make a second referendum more likely   A second EU referendum has become slightly *more* likely in recent days, after Labour backed a bid to hold one. But overall, its still looking very unlikey. There arent enough pro-referendum MPs in Parliament to back one, and Theresa May continues to oppose the idea. She said today it would be isive for the country.  We dont know yet. Theresa May repeatedly refused to say how she will vote personally on a No Deal Brexit. And Downing Street officials refused to say how Tory MPs will be whipped on either No Deal, or a delay to Brexit. That means the government has promised these votes but we dont actually know what the governments opinion is on the outcome yet. What about the Spring Statement   Talk about timing! Chancellor Philip Hammond is delivering his Spring Statement to the House of Commons on Wednesday  March . Its expected to start at .pm and last around  minutes. It had been widely thought the Statement would be used to outline plans for No Deal spendingTheresa Mays deal failed. Despite the change, its understood the Spring Statement has not been moved - despite being scheduled for the same date as a vote on whether to agree or prevent a No Deal Brexit. If both are on the same day, the Spring Statement will come first, and the No Deal vote afterwards. However, the No Deal vote could be held first.  The move will deepen the calamitous split in the Tory party. Downing Street claimed there was broad Cabinet agreement for the plan today - but refused to sayit was unanimous. It came after Remain-backing ministers threatened to resign rather than allow a No Deal Brexit. But now that shes compromised, Theresa May has the Brexiteers to deal with. Backbench Tories lined up today, furious at the idea of a delay. My residents don’t want an extension of Article , said Giles Watling. It takes two to tango and it’s time the EU learned to dance. Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said: My suspicion is that any delay to Brexit is a plot to stop Brexit. This would be the most grievous error that politicians could commit.

Roger Cazaly, who runs Plume of Feathers in Portscatho, Cornwall with we Helen, gives as good as he gets on the website. The quaint th Century pub near the beach has received more than  “excellent” or “very good” reviews on TripAdvisor, but there are  “terrible” critiques from members of the public. Roger told one diner he hadn’t “cringed this much in a long time” at their post. He also compared one customer to “a small child that can’t have a biscuit, Cornwall Live says. But people on social media have lauded Roger. I think the pub Landlord sounds like a legend, wrote one woman. Another posted: Excellent answers! Well done the landlord... One Facebook user wrote: I want to go just to meet the Landlord. What a legend! I loved his responses.   One diner had previously put on TripAdvisor: Just popped in for some food, was told they were too busy. Said we’d just have some drinks, they basically suggested that go someone . Rude, arrogant. Rogers y reply read: “Now now Kitty, its not nice to call people names. But seeing as youve decided to go on the worldwide web and call me names like a little child who didnt get what she wanted when she demanded it, let’s talk about your visit. “Folks, it was a Saturday evening on the bank holiday weekend of the half term, it was between  and .pm. This is possibly the most premium time food wise in any restaurant or pub, especially in a little Cornish pub in the middle of a holiday destination. We were at full flow, every table taken, tables had been booked weeks in advance, the kitchen is maxed out. “However, Kittyminx,she comes to the bar with her children and says Chips, I want chips for my children. I responded with an apology and said thats fine but there will probably be about a  or  minute wait and probably apologised again. “You seemed stunned by this, so I went onto explain that we were absolutely maxed out and there will be a waityou want to go ahead and order then we had that awful  or  seconds where you just blinked and stared at me like I was speaking a foreign language, so I then said the taverna down the road is open and they do takeaway food as well, which might be a better option at this moment in time . “I actually thought I was being helpful, giving you options, but obviously you didnt see it this way. Someone dared to say no to Kittyminx!   “Now, Kittyminx, when you leave ‘reviews’ like this, it actually says more about you than the venue. Because, generally, we then go into your profile and read your other reviews and have a little chuckle. You use the words Rude and Arrogant with gay abandon dont you  We read about when you complain that the waitress had asked you to stop your children playing on the stairs  times, the poor girl … or when another venue got slagged off because you werent allowed to move the furniture … Kitty, you had probably put [it] in front of a fire escape or something. “Trust me Kittyminx, when it comes to rude and arrogant you might want to look a little closer to home.” Another diner was upset with birthday celebrations at the pub. They wrote: “We had waited all summer to have a meal at the Plume of Feathers ... very popular with tourists, no chance for locals! “We booked for Monday night as it was the actual birthday! Bad mistake! We were squeezed into a passageway! With another table reserved for later making it a very tight squeeze! We had three courses: soup, main, dessert all were warm and the meat was very tough! “Chips were under-cooked and soggy! The waiter was over the top with compliments which appeared to put pressure on us! No extra attention though given to the birthday men! I.e. a candle in their dessert or an extra biscuit! The waiter was told two of the party had birthdays! The bill was expensive to the quality of the meal! “So … tourists you are welcome to the Plume of Feathers we will not be going back! A little attention would have been lovely evenit was to sit in a restaurant with a table laid and flowers present! Then the bill wouldnt have mattered! Very disappointing as we are locals!” But in a y reply, Roger defended the boozer.   He wrote: “ exclamation points!! !! Folks, here we have the very controversial ‘locals’ scenario. This seems to happen in two locations, Cumbria and Cornwall. “When someone says they are a ‘local’, this is not to be confused with a ‘regular’. When someone enters your premises and keeps dropping ‘were locals, dont you know’ into the conversation, generally, theyre not really. “Quite often they will be from outside the county, say, somewhere like Peterborough, and theyve just moved down very recently and immediately want all the trimmings of being a ‘local’. If you dont treat them as such, evenyou have never seen them ever before in your le, they will scuttle off and go on TripAdvisor. If you do, they are full of praise and everything is wonderful. But, we just treat everyone the same.

Yet, one customer labelled the pub as having the “worst customer service ever!!!” The man wrote: “We visited the Plume of Feathers to meet up with family and friends who were all visiting from up north for a wedding. We were all treated with disdain from the landlady and her staff. “They were rude, unhelpful and made it blatantly obvious that we were not welcome. I dont know why her attitude was as it was, but it really spoiled what should have been a joyous celebration. The beer and average food was way overpriced, the toilet was filthy and stunk of urine and the interior was at best, shabby. She refused to serve any spirits because it was too early. “The top and bottom of this review is this,you visit the Plume and dont buy their way overpriced food, then you not welcome to just have a drink. “In my opinion, not worth a visit, over-priced, overrated and an arrogant landlady who’s had a charisma bypass. Worst customer service, ever.” However, Roger disputed some of these points and accused the diners group of swearing. He said: “Wasnt quite like this was it  You arrived en masse at .am and seemed surprised that we didnt serve alcohol before am. But then at am the drinking commenced. “We didnt refuse to serve spirits at all, becauseyou remember, when the young ladies found out that we didnt sell Blue WKDs in our little Cornish village pub they started drinking gin and bitter lemon. They said this was ‘lush’. So dont tell lies. “Now, you maybe alluding to the fact that we refused to sell shots at .pm. We did think it a little early and unnecessary. The younger lot seemed to agree with us and said things like ‘sound’ and ‘probably best’. But you decided to go on and on about how its the done thing up north.  “Seeing as you had only been drinking Carlsbergup to this point and your behaviour was already deteriorating at a vast rate of knots, we feel we made the right decision on not serving shots at . in the afternoon. Eventually my we had to ask you to stop swearing loudly in the pub as other people were coming in with children. I think its at this point that my we had the ‘charisma bypass’ because you then went into the loud heavy duty swearing. “So then, instead of my we asking, she told you to stop swearing, to which point she even had to get the poor father of the bride to ask you to leave because of your behaviour. “You didnt eat in the pub, so that little jibe about the food is obviously a rather pathetic attempt to make yourself feel better about your behaviour. The toilets were cleaned spotlessly in the morning and the only people that had been in the pub all day was you and your party, so I feelthere was any issues there, you may want to look a little at yourselves. “If you are asked to leave a premises due to your behaviour, just take it on the chin. Dont put sad little ‘reviews’ on websites. It embarrasses yourself and this one has embarrassed the father of the bride … again. I believe he did ask you to remove this post, but I guess you dont have that much respect.” Another reviewer criticised the food: “We took some ‘fresh’ fishes for us and chicken balls and fries for kids. Food was absolutely disgusting, for kids - everything from microwave. Sorry, I cant recommend. Maybe its good place for beer, but, unfortunately not for families with little ones.” After explaining that the fish is delivered fresh twice a day, Roger wrote: “If you cant tell the dference between microwave chipsfrom freshly prepared triple-cooked chips, Im not sure you have the skills to be putting ‘reviews’ on websites. “What are chicken balls  “I was askedI had reserved a table number, I am sitting outside. Sorry , you need to reserve a table. Sat outside with my drink , wondering where I could go. Two couples sat outside were brought food whilst I was having my drink. Nobody said that my table was reserved and could I move.   But Roger replied: “And here, ladies and gentlemen, lies the problem with TripAdvisor. “A lot of people dont quite understand the hospitality trade, andsomething disappoints them, they give it a ‘review’. And they give it a  star. “Sad isnt it  Like a small child that cant have a biscuit.... “Now, Tony M, let me give you a little lesson on the catering industry. Just because you can sit at a table and can see other empty tables does not mean we are not fully booked. “Are you with me  Its about what the kitchen can cope with at any one time, so we stagger the bookings so the kitchen doesnt get overwhelmed. Are you still with me  “Now, sometimes, when the kitchen is flowing awesomely, and someone walks in for a table without having previously booked, we will checkthe kitchen can squeeze them in between the checks they already have on. Sometimes its a yes, sometimes its a yes but they will have to wait half an hour and sometimes its a flat no. “We dont like saying no, Tony, no business likes saying no, treacle. But sometimes instead of making  promises we have to say no. Have we learnt something, blossom  “When it comes to doing a review, giving someone a  when disappointed is being a petulant child. It says everything is bad, bad, bad. Was the service bad, was the beer you drank bad  Do you see what I mean, treacle  You were just disappointed, so thats not a review is it  “Hopefully youve learnt something today, now you go and put your big boy pants on and get out there and do a proper review.

Ken and Barbara Mead,  and , say they have been left penniless and reduced to living on a boat bought for them by their daughter and son-in-law, following their battle over a warehouse they had built in Sutton, Macclesfield.Enforcement officers from Cheshire East Council have begun demolishing the building, saying the couple had breached planning permission by building it to the wrong specications and later living in it. A spokesman said evidence shows that it was always the couple’s intention to live in it. However, the family said it wanted to build the warehouse to rent out to make money and only moved in after becoming fed up with living on a canal boat when the pound, legal dispute ate up their funds. They bought the plot of land in  and, after permission for a bungalow was refused, permission was granted to build a warehouse five years ago.   But Cheshire East Council then said the building was unauthorised as it did not conform to specications, something Ken disputes and he says the particular reasons for it have never been explained. Unable to then rent it out and fed up of staying on the boat, the couple began living in the dormant warehouse in  as it had kitchen and shower facilities. The building did not have permission for residential use and the council took enforcement action - won in court - and demolition work on the warehouse began this week. Ken, a retired builder, said: “We moved to Macclesfield to be near our daughter and young grandchildren, only to find ourselves in a five-year nightmare.   “We have been left penniless and without a home. We had a building and couldn’t do anything with it even though the council signed it off as a warehouse. We have lost everything.” The couple, who have four grandchildren, estimate the costs of building the warehouse, at Bullocks Lane, and fighting the legal battle come to around pound,. Their original boat was sold to help fund their legal costs and their daughter and her husband, Susan and Arron Taylor, sold their home to buy them another to live on. Ken and Barbara, a former nurse, moved out of the warehouse and on to the canal two weeks ago. They have put many of the possessions they have left up for sale. Arron, a managing partner at Tytherington-based training company Optimality, claims the dispute can be traced to a council error.   He says planners originally gave permission for the warehouse to be built bigger than it should have been. But the council is adamant that it has followed procedure correctly and enforcement notices issued in  were vindicated by an independent planning inspector. Macclesfield MP David Rutley has spoken with the council about Ken and Barbara’s case and they have also approached Councillor Janet Jackson, a member of the planning committee. She said: “Mistakes have been made by the council and the iniduals that have led to this situation. “Hopefully the council can revise its view, negotiate with the family and find another outcome.”   A Cheshire East spokesman said: “The council had made it very clear to the owners that there was no planning permission for the erection of a dwelling and the building, which they had constructed, fell outside the scope of a permission for a warehouse. “The owners chose to ignore the council’s advice and moved into the unauthorised dwelling. “It was acknowledged by the owners’ agents as early as June , that the building under construction fell outside the scope of the permission for a warehouse and, as such, may be the subject of formal action by the council.   The site lies within the green belt, which has strict rules limiting development that can take place. The inspector found the council’s enforcement notices to be sound and fully justied. “The appeal was dismissed. The inspector’s decision also made it very clear that evidence showed that the intention of the owners was always to use the building as a dwelling and not as a warehouse. “On  January , the owners pleaded guilty in court to their failure to comply with the requirements of the notices. Failure to comply with the requirements of an enforcement notice is a criminal offence.” "},{"url":null,"title":"family student who took life","story":"NewsFamily of student who took own le left with horrendous £K bill for inquestNatasha Abrahart, , was studying at the University of Bristol when she died on April , ShareCommentsByLaura ForsythJoe Smith:,  FEB NewsNatasha Abrahart was a second-year Physics student at the University of Bristol \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe family of a student who took her own le say they were left with a horrendous poundk bill for her inquest. Natasha Abrahart had been studying physics at the University of Bristol when she died at the age of  on April , . Her parents Robert and Margaret used their le savings to pay for her inquest and are calling on the Government to change the way they provide legal aid to families.The couple were unable to get legal aid funding and were forced to crowdfund pound, to meet costs for the inquest in May. Natasha had told the university she was suicidal months before her death, as well as a student GP at the Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Trust, a pre-inquest  heard. A total of  Bristol students have taken their own lives since October .   Mum Margaret said the inquest was important to ensure changes are made at the university. She told the BBC: What keeps me going is the vision of another family experiencing what we experienced. Andthat can be prevented then it has to be worth doing. The cost of inquest hearings are covered by legal aid for some families but others, like the Abraharts, are left to find the money and represent themselves. The couple, from West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, said the process was not a level playing field, and that the universitys costs would be funded by the taxpayer. If you want to get answers you need legal help, said Mr Abrahart.   We either do nothing and go through the rest of our le with unanswered questions, with systems that may have problems and are never fixed, or try and do it on our own. If you dont have a full and proper inquest youre never going to get to the bottom of things. The couple will join charity INQUEST in parliament on Tuesday to call for automatic non-means tested legal aid funding for bereaved families following a state-related death. Deborah Coles, from the charity, said: The power imbalance between bereaved families and the state is the most signicant injustice of the coronial process.  Removing the barriers to accessing legal representation will not only create a fairer and more just inquest system, it will protect lives. The university previously said it was committed to co-operating fully with the coroner to ensure any lessons learnt are built into the support we provide our students.

The Coast Starlight train , which is popular with tourists and was traveling from Seattle to Los Angeles, got stuck at pm on Sunday night when branches damaged its engine. During the  hour nightmare, travellers rationed food, ran out of drinking water and made makesht nappies out of washcloths and safety pins.

A lot of the older kids have been really good but theyre having to run up and down and its a lot, especially the food - its not really food theyre liking. Moms are doing all they can right now. Passenger Rebekah Dodson said: We cant get off the train because theres four feet of snow in every direction, theres nowhere to go.   She described the atmosphere as like a giant kumbaya party as one teenager got out a ukulele to serenade the children to sleep. Some students had panicked because they feared their professors would not see the delay as a valid excuse for missing deadlines, according to reports.  The train, originally bound for Los Angeles, has since arrived in Eugene, Oregon, for servicing. A Union Pacic locomotive towed the train back to Eugene after crews cleared the tracks overnight, according to a spokesman."},{"url":null,"title":"hotel slammed period shaming female","story":"NewsHotel slammed for period shaming female guest with joke about Shark WeekA hotel has come under fire from a charity after sharing a post on social media shaming a guest for bleedingShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  FEB NewsA hotel has come under fire for period shaming \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDespite it being a very natural part of le, some people are still disgusted by the idea of a woman being on her period.This was something made evident last week, when Quest Palmerston, a hotel in Australia, shared a series of images of blood-covered towels and bedding on their Facebook account.The images were captioned: What an interesting week... It must be Shark Week and a number of hashtags were used including #housekeepers and #disgusting.   The photos were met with backlash from many, including womens advocacy group and charity Share the Dignity. Quest Palmerstons post has since been deleted, but Share the Dignity uploaded screengrabs of it to social media, in order to educate people about period shaming. They claim Shark Week is a derogatory phrase for women on their period and described the post as poor taste. There are just no words Quest Palmerston, they wrote. Shaming a woman for getting her period and posting pics on social media.   The post has been taken down now, but this day and age this is poor taste. #dignityall More than  people commented on Share the Dignitys Facebook in response to the photos, with some blasting the hotel and others sharing their own experiences. One woman stated: Quest Palmerston might find they have fewer female guests from now on. Another said: Appalling. All the towels and sheets get bundled up and sent out to be cleaned. Who analyses whats on the sheets    A third added: WT actual F ! ! I literally have no words! Someone  couldnt help but compare this to an incredible hotel she stayed at, who knew exactly how to help a woman on their period. I got my period early whilst staying in a hotel overseas and I was MORTIFIED. I pulled all the sheets and towels together and left the cleaner a note and a large tip as a thank you. When I got back to my room I found a note on my freshly made bes that said Dont be sorry as you have nothing to be sorry for. I took the money you so kindly left and have stocked your mini bar with chocolate, ice cream and wine and in the bathroom is a box of over the counter period pain relief. Never be sorry for your body doing its job. May have been the hormones but I bawled like a tired two-year-old, whilst I ate chocolate and ice cream.   Quest Palmerston have since issued an apology on their Facebook page. They wrote: We are deeply apologetic to all for the recent post and comment on the Quest Palmerston Facebook page that has been removed, this is not in line with our standards or the Quest brand. We have addressed the post with staff responsible.According to ABC News, the employee responsible for the post has been suspended and will be subjected to an internal review."},{"url":null,"title":"india pakistan kashmir live conflict","story":"NewsIndia Pakistan conflict LIVE updates as jets shot down and pilots captured in KashmirAll domestic and international flights from Pakistan have stopped - with India also shutting airports as the crisis deepensShareByAndrew GilpinChris kitchingUpdated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video indian-air-force-strikes-targets-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\" data-chronos-request-url\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx v live-centre nationals-live \" data-embedded-url-endpoint\"https:www.mirror news world-news india-pakistan-kashmir-live-conflict- serviceresponsiveembeddedArticleUrl\" data-chronos-domain\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx \" data-inview\"true\"Pakistan says it has shot down two Indian jets in its airspace and captured two pilots alive, sparking fears of war as world leaders call for restraint.

Dozens of women were murdered by barbaric extremists near the terror groups last stronghold in Baghuz, eastern Syria. ISIS is making its last desperate stand in the rubble-strewn town on the banks of the Euphrates. And callous fighters dumped the womens heads in dustbins in their latest merciless act, Mail on Sunday reports. They [the jihadis] conducted a cowardly slaughter of these desperately unfortunate women as a final act of depravity and left their severed heads behind for us to find. The motivation for such a sickening act is beyond comprehension for any remotely normal human being.   None of the SAS troops who entered Baghuz will forget what they saw, which some soldiers likened to a scene from the film Apocalypse Now. Their only solace is that they have contributed to bringing Islamic States reign of terror to an end, a source told the publication. British Special Forces earlier this month fired  mortar bombs and tens of thousands of machine-gun rounds in further battles in Baghuz. More than  jihadis were killed during the conflict.  Its understood ISIS is holding civilian hostages in a small area of Baghuz. But a source told Mail on Sunday: The battle proper began on February . In the first two days,  IS fighters were killed and  enemy positions were destroyed, including the jihadis operational control centre in a mosque in Baghuz on February . An advance by the SAS and SDF troops caused IS to go underground, utilising a network of tunnels under the town, but the rats couldnt escape because, even with the heavy cloud cover and dust storms, we were able to use drones effectively and identy openings to these tunnels.  It is believed British troops have been deployed with sophisticated night vision in their fight against the extremists. Iris-recognition technology was used to identy high-ranking terrorists whose biometric data had previously been harvested by Special Forces. The battles continue in Baghuz.

Liam Ewing told jurors: “You have heard how the girl described screaming as he raped her.” He added: “I ask you to examine the evidence. She goes into a lot of detail about what happened to her. I invite you toa guilty verdict.” The alleged victim, who is now , claimed that Curdy, , from Ayr, raped her three times. She alleged that on each occasion he whispered to her afterwards” If you tell anyone I will kill you and your mum.” Curdy, who is on trial at the High Court in Glasgow, denies raping her on ious occasions between April  and August , , at a house in the South of France. Mr Ewing told the jury that the Crown is relying on testimony from the girls mother, who is , to corroborate the rape. She alleges that Curdy also raped her in August  in the South of France. The mothers allegation, which he denies, is not before the jury. Under Scots Law alleged crimes against children committed in another country can be prosecuted here, but not those against adults. The mother claimed that after having consensual sex with her, Curdy went on to rape her. Defence counsel Lorenzo Alonzi told the jury: “If you apply the law, you will find that the correct verdict in this case is acquittal.” Mr Alonzi said in his closing speech that there was absolutely no independent evidence in this case – only the allegations of the girl and her mother. He went on: “There is no DNA evidence, there is no torn clothing, there is no medical evidence and no witnesses who heard screams. “The idea that there was this monstrous threat to kill her and her mum, it doesnt stack up.” Curdy claimed that the two woman made up the allegations about him after he demanded theof his pound, gold and diamond Rolex watch.

In fact, on average, Borderers are forking out pound less than their Northumbrian opposite numbers.Since First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the end of the freeze in , Scottish Borders Council has taken full advantage of the ability to raise council tax by % each year, and this year is no dferent, as the council agreed to a three per cent increase in December .However, the deal agreed by the SNP and Scottish Greens allows councils to raise tax by up to . per cent for  .Council leader Shona Haslam, who represents Tweeddale East, has been adamant that Scottish Borders Council will not take advantage of the increased limit, and will not raise an extra . per cent on Borderersrsquo council tax, instead sticking to an increase of three per cent.Council will not introduce workplace parking levy:Scottish Conservatives in the Borders have been very vocal about their opposition to the Scottish Government plans to introduce a workplace parking levy, where employers will be charged an annual tax based on how many parking spaces they provide for their employees.The aim is to persuade more commuters to use public transport in a bid to reduce pollution, but the charge could lead to employers passing the bill onto their employees.Both councillor Haslam and Scottish Borders Councilrsquos SNP opposition leader Stuart Bell, who both represent the rural ward of Tweeddale East, have signalled their opposition to the plans, so it is extremely unlikely this will feature in the councilrsquos budget proposals.Borderers who travel to Edinburgh for work could possibly be affected by the levy though, as Edinburgh City Council is considering implementing the charges.A move to three-weekly bin collections:Rumours have been circulating amongst councillors that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos waste refuse collection service will move to three-weekly bin collections, from the current once-a-fortnight collectionThe local authority is currently reviewing its waste collection service, which is expected to feed into the new budget for  .In fact, at a meeting of the council in October , Selkirkshire councillor Gordon Edgar, the authorityrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, refused to rule out the possibility when questioned by Hawick and Denholm councillor David Paterson.,params: .pushThe veteran Hawick councillor said: ldquoIf they go to a three-weekly collection it would cause some very serious problems for many of the people that we represent and I am sure it would increase the incidents of fly tipping.No tourism tax:Another controversial aspect of the SNP Scottish Greens budget proposals is the introduction of a tourism tax on nightly accommodation.Much like the workplace parking levy, local authorities have discretion over whether to implement it or not, and again Scottish Borders Tories have ruled out introducing it here.Changes to grass cutting services:Grass cutting, or the lack of it, has been a constant thorn in the side of the council over the past year.As an issue which caused a large furore, Scottish Borders Council could well announce further changes to the grass cutting regime, particularly around the maintenance of cemeteries.Changing the frequency of grass cutting from a -day cycle to a -day cycle was widely criticised by communities, with residents reporting overgrown public spaces and ankle-high grass in the regionrsquos cemeteries.Many opposition councillors have called for a rethink on the councilrsquos grass cutting policy, and due to the large number of complaints from Borders resident it is expected to be addressed in Thursdayrsquos budget announcement."},{"url":null,"title":"sos-to-keep-youth-club-afloat","story":"AN SOS has been issued in a bid to keep a village youth club open.Walkerburn Youth Club needs adults who have an interest or experience in working with young people to get in touch.The club meets at the Public Hall every Thursday evening from . to pm -

and a foot-tapping reminder of the swinging sexism of the late s.For anyone who enjoys those wonderful kitchen-sink dramas of the decade - A Taste of Honey, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, or Poor Cow - this is for you.Although, in fairness, at times it feels more Sid James than Shelagh Delaney as the humour and slapstick of Carry On provide plenty of laughs.And for anyone, like myself, who doesnt already know Made in Dagenham the Musical, dont despair... the songs, like the early Ford Cortinas, are instantly adorable.Kirsty Cleland has all the allure of a young Rita Tushingham as she enchants, enthrals and entertains in the lead role.As a strike-leader and long-suffering we, the Galashiels actress is both convincing and commanding.And the ever-reliable Stuart Mitchell, who plays hard-done-by husband Eddie, has to be at the top of his game not to be outshone.But, in true socialist fashion, Made in Dagenham the Musical isnt just about the leads... everyone has their part to play - and how well they play it.Tracy Borthwick is having a blast as the potty-mouthed Beryl.And Amanda Blacklock is pitch perfect as the hapless Clare who attempts to keep up with the flow of double-entendres.Ellen McFadzen, with her Viv Nicholson hair-style and shortening mini-skirts, is a delight as sassy Sandra.And the shopfloor resolve is perfectly pitched by Ellen Halliday, as Cassie, and Julie Craig, as Connie.Relationships, friendships and even governments are tested in this factual story which, historically, helped females eventually earn an equal footing when it came to filling up pay packets.Robin Murray could challenge Mike Yarwood with his hilarious performance as Harold Wilson.And hes regularly brought down a peg or two by the feisty Rachel Inglis as Barbara Castle.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a battle of the classes as much as the sexes, with Jodie Millar and Yvonne Mitchell providing some gentried grace.The dialogue is a delight, the foot-to-the-floor pace is perfect, and the choreography, costumes, straight from Carnaby Street, and score makes sure this is a production that will strike a chord for decades to come.But for any musical production to be a success, it needs songs.From the brilliant opening scene, this show doesnt disappoint.Busy Women, Everybody Out and Viva Eastbourne are nothing other than tremendous encore numbers that bring out the very best of this talented cast.But perhaps the highlights are Julie Craigs sensational take on the riveting Same Old Story, Rachel Inglis reaching the high notes in the incredible Ideal World, and the delightful duet of Stuart Mitchell and Kirsty Cleland with the making-up masterpiece Im Sorry, I Love You.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a celebration of women fighting for their rights.While it succeeds, this move away from the comfort zone is more of a testament to just how good Selkirk Musical Theatre Company has become.If you havent yet got your tickets... join the picket line quickly and dont be disappointed.Made in Dagenham the Musical runs every night this week at .pm with an additional matinee performed on Saturday at pm.CASTRita OGrady -

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"letter district news disappoints","story":"I note that for the second week running the Islay section of the Courier#sIs this now Courier policy Are we to have a regular feature on the wonderful works and world of the all-conquering Alastair to sit alongside his weekly SNP bad letter It was said of Alan Reid in his days as MP that he would attend the opening of an envelope Alistair Redman could give him lessons.A Google search for our beloved councillor produces Alastair Redman archives # Campbeltown Courier as the th result, after two for ArgyllThere seems to me to be an uncomfortably close association between our local paper and a local politician.Tony WilliamsGrumpy Old ManMuasdale"},{"url":null,"title":"letter maintain tarberts social housing","story":"The issue that I hear about the most, from ward members in Tarbert, is the need for new social housing and the importance of maintaining and improving the existing housing stock.While the four new houses that are planned are welcome many residents have quite rightly said that many more are needed.Both externally and internally, housing must be improved including repairing and repainting the hallways that link many housing association flats.There have also been calls to rollout external wall insulation across all of the social housing in Tarbert, and while there has been a start on this clearly more needs to be done.As a social housing tenant myself I know all to well the dficulties in getting housing associations to act on concerns raised by tenants.I continue to press for more and better social housing across the Kintyre and Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"letter support the raf benevolent fund","story":"Last month’s vandalism at the Bomber Command memorial highlighted the very worst and the very best of our communities.I cannot thank your readers enough for their incredible support in the wake of this shocking paint attack.To date we have received more than £, in donations to help the RAF Benevolent Fund meet the repair bill.Repair works have now been completed on the memorial and it is now ed to its former glory.As well as the donations received, the RAF Benevolent Fund had thousands of messages of support from around the world.It was heart-warming to see the regard in which the memorial, the veterans and the , men it stands to represent are held.We must never forget their sacrices and the RAF Benevolent Fund is proud to beof this tribute to their legacy, for generations to come.As the Fund enters its th year of support for the RAF family, we must not forget those veterans who are still with us.Our aim this year is to ask for the public’s help in reaching more of these veterans and their families, while we still can.Our support could help pay for the care costs of an RAF widow, or provide for mobility aids to keep an elderly veteran at home, or simply allow a veteran to enjoy his retirement in dignity and comfort, through a regular financial grant.Put simply, the RAF Benevolent Fund looks after the RAF family.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"single-primary-school-plan-for-prestonpans-to-go-ahead","story":"The proposal to close the two schools and establish a new primary school covering nursery to P, operating from the existing school sites, followed a public consultation.Councillors agreed to progress the plans at a meeting of East Lothian Council on December .This decision needed to be ratied by Scottish Ministers.The new school will follow a single curriculum and a single headteacher will be appointed to oversee its management.The school structure in the town currently has nursery to P children attending the infant school before transferring to the primary school for P to P however, both schools operate their own curriculums independently.Fiona Robertson, the councilrsquos head of education, said: ldquoPrestonpans is the only area in East Lothian where nursery to P and P-P are taught across two schools.ldquoWe believe having one primary school, working under a single management structure, will benefit pupils at all levels of their learning as it does where in the county by ensuring a smoother progression through school and better coherence across the curriculum at all ages and stages.ldquoEducation Scotland has recognised the potential educational benefits and opportunities for greater coherence in the curriculum.ldquoWe have written to staff and parents to advise them of this decision.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons. Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever. It seems to be reinforcing outmoded concepts of gender to suggest that, because someone wants to wear dresses, play with dolls and put on makeup, they must have a lady brain in a male body. I thought we had left pink-for-girls gender stereotyping behind. But never mind. No-one wishes trans people any ill ndash certainly not me. But now that we are abandoning the very biological definition of sex, there are some anomalies that need to be addressed.Last week, a British transgender man, who had IVF by sperm donation and gave birth, won a court battle to prevent his child having ldquomother on its birth certicate. It will be the first child in history to have no mother. The The AIRE Centre, a human rights charity, contested this on the grounds that it would make le dficult for the child in future, when they apply for visas or anything which enquires about family background. The Government said simply that this isnrsquot a problem. From now on, fathers can give birth ndash end of.But Irsquom not sure this is the end of the matter. Children have not been included in the gender recognition debate thus far, even though they have rights too. It could be psychologically disturbing for a child to find, one day, that its mother has decided to become its dad. That song ldquoSometimes I feel like a motherless child takes on a whole new meaning.Of course, the trans parent will still be present, but is it OK to expect a child to suddenly start calling her natural mother her father  I would have thought that a child has a continuing right to a legal motherthey were born with one. If misgendering a trans person is unacceptable, surely demothering a child should be too. This is going to be confusing to say the least.Then there is the question of sport. The controversy over athlete Caster Semenya, a woman with high testosterone, raises the question of how to regard trans womenrsquos participation in women-only sport. Athletes who have testes, and therefore posses greater body mass, muscle strength and bone density, have an unfair advantage over old-fashioned women who have genetically female bodies.Next week, the International Association of Athletics Federations will argue in a hearing in Switzerland that people like Semenya should take testosterone-suppressing drugs before competing. Not only would this drive a coach and horses through the anti-doping protocols, it surely poses problem for transgender athletes who, of course, also take drugs like testosterone to help them transition to their ldquocorrect male sex. I hope the sporting authorities can get their heads around that because I canrsquot.Yet this is a very live issue in many sports. In the US, the ban on trans women taking part in power-lting events is being lted to prevent accusations of discrimination. You might have thought that having beefy, male-bodied women participating in these contests is discriminating against women athletes. Though, of course, only transphobes would say that, so we wonrsquot go there.The logical solution to this conundrum is to end sexual segregation in sport. Andwomen who are born biologically female never win any medals, tough. Strangely, there doesnrsquot seem to be the same issue about female-bodied trans men participating in male-only sport . Irsquom sure that has nothing whatever to do with the fact that they wonrsquot win anything.So welcome to the brave new world of post-sexual dferentiation, where men become women and fathers have children. It is one of the most radical and abrupt cultural changes in human history.Women have had a pretty bad deal in previous centuries, when they were regarded often as chattels without rights. In some Muslim societies theyrsquore still second-class citizens. Now, as women are finally emerging from the shadow of patriarchy, they are being told, by men, that they no longer have exclusive rights to their sexual identity.Itrsquos a weird turn of events. It seems women are just on the wrong side of history. But somehow, I donrsquot think theyrsquoll go quietly."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Last chance for Mundell to put country before party","story":"The majority of these demands are perfunctory, of course, made in the knowledge and expectation that they will be ignored by the target, while playing well with the initiatorrsquos supporters.The craziness of the last few months has precipitated a flurry of genuine and warranted resignation demands, however, which under normal political circumstances would have resulted in multiple ministerial heads rolling in any other era the Prime Minister would have been forced out long ago.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysAnother case in point is Scottish Secretary David Mundell, whose stubborn insistence on being ineffectual in the face of the biggest crisis this country has faced in generations is matched only by that of Jeremy Corbyn. Mr Mundellrsquos wan smiles and empty words about doing the best for Scotland as the Government he is a member of readies itself to push us off the no-deal Brexit clf, is as astonishing as it is appalling.

The SNP is right to call for Mr Mundell to show some mettle and make clear that he will not serve in a Government that is willing to take us out of the European Union without a deal, a situation that would put the already fragile Scottish economy on the road to ruin. As the Scottish Secretary is well aware, businesses will fail, jobs will be lost and real people will suffer the sort of real hardships that will be dficult to recover from.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford has written to Mr Mundell, laying out the gravity of the situation and calling on him to back growing cross-party demands to halt the Brexit process by extending Article  and making clear to his boss, Theresa May, that he will resign unless she faces up the extremists in her party and takes no-deal off the table.At this critical juncture, the least that the people of Scotland deserve from the man who represents them at Cabinet level is honesty about where his loyalties lie: will he put country or party first  Mr Mundell, it really is that simple.Read more: Mundell should resign there is no-deal BrexitOf course, Mr Blackfordrsquos letter also highlights the bleakness of the dilemma facing the SNP. If Mrs May gets her way and Parliament is faced with a last-minute binary choice between her terrible deal - which deprives us of the key benefits being in the EU - and an even more catastrophic no-deal, it leaves the party in a dficult position. How should Nicola Sturgeon instruct her MPs to vote in this scenario  Backing Mrs Mayrsquos ldquomy way or the highway deal would be criticised by many as a U-turn of epic proportions and a sign of weakness. Not voting for it, and thus facilitating a no-deal Brexit, would likely be viewed by many voters as unforgivable, leaving the party open to allegations that this is the outcome it has been secretly hoping for all along, in order to boost support for independence.Ms Sturgeon and her colleagues will be hoping the growing number of Tory ministers and backbench MPs ndash including Cabinet secretaries Amber Rudd, Greg Clarke and David Gauke - poised to revolt against their leader should she refuse to rule out a no-deal Brexit, will come to their rescue in the frantic days and weeks to come.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysThe emergence of the The Independent Groupmay also end up helping the SNPrsquos predicament, at least in the short term. Formed last week when eight MPs resigned from Labour unhappy at Mr Corbynrsquos disastrous leadership, it did not initially appear to be an important development. But when three Tory MPs also resigned and joined up, using the moment to launch a blistering attack on Mrs Mayrsquos disastrous Brexit strategy and their partyrsquos lurch to the right, it started to feel more signicant.What binds these MPs from dferent sides of the House of Commons is dismay at the drt of both parties to the extremities.

The minister, Lindsay Thomson, told Clark he had something in his possession that might interest him. This turned out to be a fiddle once owned by Niel Gow and Clark subsequently had the pleasure of playing this fiddle in Little Dunkeld kirk, in whose churchyard Gow is buried, in .Clark didnrsquot imagine that hersquod ever have another chance to play this fiddle as Lindsay Thomson died about a year later, so on that morning in San Francisco he was surprised to be hearing from Thomsonrsquos son David.ldquoI must have made an impression on Lindsay because his son was calling to arrange a meeting and when I suggested recording an album of Niel Gow tunes using the fiddle that Lindsay had been given by his music teacher and had once belonged to Niel Gow as a tribute to Lindsay, David immediately agreed, says Clark. The album, Niel Gowrsquos Fiddle, was released in  and Clark is proud to be the fiddlersquo custodian still.Clarkrsquos championing of Niel Gow and his music over the past thirty years or more has bordered on the heroic. In  his interest in Gow led to him staging a festival in and around Birnam and Dunkeld to celebrate his hero. Itrsquos now in its th year and when the th edition of the festival takes place next year, a le-sized bronze statue of Gow by the artist David Annand will be unveiled.ldquoIrsquove always been struck by the fact that there isnrsquot a major lasting memorial to Gow who, for me, is one of Scottish traditional musicrsquos most signicant figures, says Clark. ldquoEverywhere you go you see statues of Robert Burns, and Irsquove no problem with that, but Gowrsquos legacy is immense. He and Burns met, of course, during Burnsrsquo Highland tour and Burns set words to Gowrsquos tunes ndash Major Graham of Inchbrakie, for example, is believed to be the original air to My Love is Like a Red, Red Rose. Therersquos Gowrsquos headstone in Little Dunkeld kirk yard and therersquos a plaque on the cottage where he lived in Inver,you know where to look for it. More recently therersquos been the carved bench under Niel Gowrsquos tree on the banks of the Tay but thatrsquos about a mile upriver from Dunkeld, and even just from a cultural tourism point of view we could be doing more to raise awareness in him.Clark first became smitten by Gowrsquos music as a teenager. He grew up in Dunfermline and one night he heard Davie Lockhart of the Fe group Heritage playing a melody that grabbed him instantly. On asking what this tune was called he was told it was Niel Gowrsquos Lament for the Death of His Second We, an air that could almost be Gowrsquos theme tune, such is its popularity among fiddler players still today.ldquoI went away and learned that tune and kept my ears and eyes open for more of Gowrsquos work, says Clark. ldquoItrsquos the emotional pull of that particular tune that stayed with me and then years later, just by chance, I ended up living in Birnam, not far from Inver, where Gow lived, and it just seemed natural to delve into the history of the area because a lot of Gowrsquos tunes were inspired by or dedicated to nearby places and people from roundabout. I got hooked on the man and what hersquod done for Scottish fiddle music.Gowrsquos music was preserved through his son Nathanielrsquos publishing of a three-volume collection, The Beauties of Niel Gow. The tunes in these books werenrsquot just Gowrsquos own. His four sons ndash Nathaniel, William, John and Andrew ndash were all fiddlers and tunesmiths and Nathaniel, who set up a publishing company in Edinburgh, was essentially documenting the repertoire that the family played ldquoon gigs.ldquoThe bread and butter of what they did was dance music, says Clark. ldquoThatrsquos how they made their living, mostly, and therersquos a wealth of jigs, reels and strathspeys that they played for dancing. But there are also a lot of lovely slow airs, quite a lot of them, but not all, laments and this talent passed down the family. Niel Gow Junior, who was Nathanielrsquos son and Niel Seniorrsquos grandson, wrote a lovely lament for Flora Macdonald and Niel himself wrote beautul airs that Robert Burns, as I said earlier, picked up on. Their meeting, when they spent a day at least going over tunes in Niel Gowrsquos cottage, would have been quite some occasion at which to be a fly on the wall.Clark gives a flavour of what might have happened on that day in  during the illustrated walk he takes festivalgoers on each March. The couple who currently live in Gowrsquos cottage lay on soup and drams as the tour takes in their garden and along the route Clark plays tunes that Gow wrote for the ious locations, including the Bridge of Inver and Dunkeld Hermitage Bridge.To be playing this music on a fiddle that once belonged to the composer, as Clark will be doing once again in Little Dunkeld Church on Saturday March , is a privilege and no small thrill for someone so enthralled by Gow.ldquoIrsquove played other fiddles that were Niel Gowrsquos, because there are several of them around, and the thing that always strikes me is how light they seem, he says. ldquoThe one I have just now is no exception. It almost feels fragile but as soon as I draw a bow across the strings I can hear the gorgeous tone. The thing about this fiddle is that itrsquos the one Niel Gow treasured during the last few years of his le. It could even be the one on which he wrote his Lament for the Death of his Second We and to think I could be playing the tune that introduced me to Niel Gow on Niel Gowrsquos fiddle, with all the history associated with it, is quite a feeling.This sense of being ldquohands on with Gow is likely to continue with David Annandrsquos statue.ldquoDavidrsquos works donrsquot tend to go on plinths, says Clark. ldquoHe created the statue of Robert Fergusson outside the Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh and therersquos another one dedicated to another poet, William Soutar in Perth thatrsquos easily accessible. After I saw the big fiddle that forms the memorial to the Scottish fiddler James Hill in Gateshead, I thought about having a big fiddle made for Niel Gow. But itrsquos more fitting to have a le-size statue that, in the age of the selfie, people can ndash and Irsquom sure they will ndash interact with.The th Niel Gow Festival takes place from March  to  in Birnam Arts Centre and other venues in the Dunkeld area.

 of the EU Withdrawal Act - table a motion to be voted on by Wednesday March  at the latest, asking this Houseit supports leaving the EU without a Withdrawal Agreement and a framework for a future relationship on March .\"So the United Kingdom will only leave without a deal on March there is explicit consent in the House for that outcome.\"Third,the House, having rejected the deal negotiated with the EU, then rejects leaving on March  without a Withdrawal Agreement and future framework, the Government will on March  bring forward a motion on whether Parliament wants to seek a short, limited extension to Article .\"If MPs vote for an extension, the Government will \"seek to agree that extension approved by the House with the EU, and bring forward the necessary legislation to change the exit date commensurate with that extension\", said Mrs May.The Prime Minister said that an extension of Article  beyond the end of June would require the UK to take part in European Parliament elections in May and that a shorter extension would \"almost certainly have to be a one-off\".\"An extension cannot take no-deal off the table,\" she warned. \"The only way to do that is to revoke Article , which I shall not do, or agree a deal.\"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that Mrs May appeared to be adopting the terms of a cross-party amendment put forward by Yvette Cooper and Sir Oliver Letwin designed to prevent no-dealher Withdrawal Agreement is voted down on March .But he told MPs: \"Until the Prime Minister is clear what alternative she would put forward in that circumstance, then she is continuing to run down the clock.\"She promises a short extension but for what \"Mr Corbyn confirmed that Labour will table an amendment to the Governments motion calling for a deal based on its priorities of a customs union, close alignment with the single market and matching EU workplace and environmental rights.\"If the Government wants a genuine renegotiation it should do so on terms that can win a majority of this House, on terms backed by businesses and unions and that are contained within Labours amendment, which I urge the whole House to back tomorrow,\" he said.The Prime Minister hit out at Mr Corbyn over Labours support for a second referendum.\"He has gone back on his promise to respect the referendum result and now wants to hold a isive second

Leonard suggested thatMPs backed an extension to Brexit next month, it ought to be longer than the two months to the end of June identied by Mrs May.He said: ldquoI donrsquot think simply putting a time limit of two months on it is right.ldquoI think that the extension needs to take account of the fact that there is work to be done on trying to find a deal thatrsquos acceptable.ldquoI think that there is growing evidence from the European Commission that they are prepared to lend credibility to the Labour option which is going to be put before parliament this week.ldquoI think given there are signals from the EU negotiating team that they would be prepared to work with that deal, I think itrsquos important the UK parliament gives proper consideration to that and I sincerely hope that the UK parliament would vote for that.Askedhe was therefore happy with an extension that took the UK into the next European Parliament session, he said: ldquoI actually think that this decision is more

However, the Scotrsquos defiance could cost him his job as Scottish Secretary David Mundellrsquos parliamentary private secretary.The focus will quickly turn to mid-March when MPs are set to have not one, not two but three votes respectively on the PMrsquos new-look plan, a no-deal and extending Article .While Mrs May insists progress is being made, the UK-EU talks seem as far away from a resolution as ever the assumption at Westminster is whatever the PM s with on March  will not be enough.She was coy yesterday about how she and her Government would vote on the second vote on no-deal. Rightly so, as by then it could be Brexiteer ministers and not Remainers threatening resignation.Then will come the crunch third vote on extension. In such circumstances this will pass. But the key question will be: how long will be the delay Mrs May wants it ldquoas short as possible but MPs could successfully amend the motion to extend Article  for months.Whatever timeline MPs agree, there is then the little matter of getting the EU to endorse it.By then, Brussels will have the UK over a barrel becauseit were not to agree, then there would be nothing to stop the country crashing out of the bloc without a deal two weeks later.Then, of course, the Brexit monster might have yet another twist to torment us with.Asked what would happenMPs voted against all three options, the PMrsquo spokesman paused and said: ldquoThat would be quite contradictory and an unexpected thing to happen.But as we know in this never-ending psychodrama, anything can happen."},{"url":null,"title":"outlander-boost-for-scotlands-heritage-sites","story":"The historic sites manned by the staff of Historic Environment Scotlandhave reported an increase in footfall to ,, people in , a five per cent increase on .The Amazon Prime series Outlander, the time-travel historical drama based on the best selling books by Diana Gabaldon, is shot at ious locations, including Doune Castle, Craigmillar Castle, Blackness Castle, Linlithgow Castle and Aberdour Castle: all have experienced record years.The most-visited staffed site was Edinburgh Castle with ,, visitors, a figure which is a rise of % on the previous year.Stirling Castle was the second-top visited site with , visitors, up %, followed by , visitors to Urquhart Castle.This is the first time Urquhart Castle has welcomed over , visitors in a single year, and represents a rise of % in visitors.Blackness Castle reaching , visitors for the first time ndash an increase of % from the previous year.The th century fortress is the setting for the Fort William headquarters of ldquoBlack Jack Randall in the series, while Doune Castle is the location for the fictional Castle Leoch in the series.Outlander premiered in , and much of its filming is done in Scotland, on location at historic sites, including the Old Town of Edinburgh, as well as purpose-built studios in Cumbernauld.The show, which stars Sam Heughan as Jamie Fraser and Caitriona Balfe as Claire Randall in its lead roles, has been a success for its producers Starz: they have agreed to make fth and sixth seasons.HES also had a record number of memberships in  which peaked at over , ndash up from % in .In total,  of the top  visited sites run by the HES registered record attendances.Sites staffed by the HES, they reported, generated poundm of local tourism expenditure in  ndash up poundm from  -

We were delighted to be welcomed on board to provide this training and it’s great to see a company like Serco NorthLink Ferries take accessibility for passengers seriously.”The MV Hjaltland will also host a Making Connections workshop today, Friday, February . The workshop will look at how passengers navigate potential barriers when changing from one mode of transport to another. Making Connections brings disabled people together with transport operators to discuss, address and plan how travel connections can be made easier.Seumas Campbell, customer service director at NorthLink Ferries, said: “Catering for passengers with ying degrees of disability is an important part of our service provision. Whether they are using our website to book their journey, making a connection from other forms of public transport or coming on board one of our vessels, we believe that passengers should experience a service that caters to all their needs.“The new website software will allow visitors to customise what they see and hear and as more and more visitors from around the world choose NorthLink Ferries to travel to the Northern Isles, ‘Recite Me’ is a great tool to help them plan and book their journey.“Our workshops are also a great way in training our staff on how they can best help and understand passengers’ needs. We pride ourselves on having a great team that always provides the best service so it’s important that we’re constantly refreshing their training.”For more information on accessibility for passengers on NorthLink Ferries, you can visit www.northlinkferries copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history. It is also our hope that this awareness will inspire the public to support fundraising efforts by the John Rae Society, to restore Rae#s birthplace at the Hall of Clestrain in Oprhir.The team have said any addition funds raised are to be used to produce a documentary film and book about the le and exploits of Rae, the expedition and the history communities, culture and wildle of the Arctic.The public will be able to track the team#s progress at their official website and through social media.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Orkney MSP has today, Tuesday, urged the Scottish Government to #pay heed to the realities of fuel poverty.#The figures, published by the Scottish Government, showed that the fuel poverty rate in Orkney was  per cent — compared to  per cent in the City of Edinburgh.“Fuel poverty levels are shameful Scotland-wide in this day and age,# said Mr McArthur.#However, these figures underline that rural and island communities are disproportionately badly affected.“I have consistently made the case for recognition of this alarming disparity, and I am glad that the Housing Minister has now agreed to look at options to recognise that ahead of Stage Two of the Fuel Poverty Bill.“Orkney and other rural and island communities urgently need targeted action to reduce the astronomical rates of fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty.

Mr McArthur believes this reflects a change in approach by the government, after months of campaigning by the Orkney MSP and a range of organisations involved in tackling fuel poverty across the Highlands and Islands.During his remarks, Mr McArthur pointed out that when it comes to fuel poverty, rural and island areas are disproportionately affected, with Orkney having the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty anywhere in Scotland.Commenting after the debate, Mr McArthur said: “Fuel poverty blights communities across Scotland, but there is no doubt that it has a disproportionate impact on rural and island areas. Until recently, however, the Scottish Government appeared unwilling to recognise this fact or indeed the higher costs faced by those living in our rural and island communities.“Over recent months, working with a range of organisations with a wealth of experience and expertise in tackling fuel poverty, I have made the case for the Minister, Kevin Stewart to think again.  It was a case that the Local Government Committee was also persuaded to support.“I am delighted, therefore, that the Minister has had a change of heart and committed to bring forward amendments to his bill at stage two that better reflect the specic nature of fuel poverty in places like Orkney.  I look forward to seeing the detail of those amendments and will work with Mr Stewart, and local stakeholders in Orkney, to make sure we get this right.“Given the impact fuel poverty can have, not just on people’s quality of le but their physical and mental health, this bill has the potential to make a real dference.  For that to happen, it must be both effective and ambitious in eradicating fuel poverty from communities across the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We will be looking to strengthen the Bill as it progresses through the Scottish Parliament and ensuring that the Scottish Governmentrsquos pledges are met.\"Before Wednesdayrsquos debate Mr Stewart said: ldquoWithin this ground-breaking legislation, not only are we one of the few countries in the world to define fuel poverty, we are also setting a goal towards eradicating it.ldquoBy changing the definition of fuel poverty so itrsquos more closely aligned to relative income poverty and taking steps to ensure it works for remote rural and island communities, we are ensuring our support is focussed on those who need it most.\"He added: \"In this day and age, it is unacceptable that any Scottish household should have to choose between having the heating on and cooking their dinner.Councillor Ian Cockburn, who represents the Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh welcomed the Bill as \"something has to be done about fuel poverty\" while arguing it is also time to rethink infrastructure like the national grid.\"It is ambitious but has to be tried to get fuel poverty down in rural areas. We are one of the most energy rich countries in the world so we should be able to get something done. Too many people take it as just being part of the landscape up here so we need to change that thinking as well to get people the assistance that they need.\"Scotland should not be in this state. But you have to look back, the National Grid was set up at the end of the war, the Highlands is considered off-grid despite supplying much of the rest of the country through hydro and wind power. It is time for a rethink.\"Calum Macaulay, chief executive of Invergordon-based Albyn Housing Society, said: ldquoWe welcome this development in the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach to addressing fuel poverty in rural areas. The push to include minimum income standards feels like a signicant step forwards. This is something that the Rural and Islands Housing Association Forum has been promoting for quite some time.\"This has included research undertaken with the support of Highlands and Islands Enterprise and others into minimum income standards in rural communities. The results of this highlighted the pressures of lower average household incomes and higher average fuel costs across the northern parts of Scotland.\"What do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupWednesday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

If the facility is not taken on by the community then it will close on March as per report to the Highland Council [on] October .ldquoNo survey will be undertaken, the facility will transfer in lsquoas seen, as isrsquo condition, the facilities will transfer in their current operational condition. The position of toilets remaining open whilst negotiations are ongoing is for this financial year only. There is no budget to retain facilities... which is why we want to get the leases sorted out before the end of March.Despite that the director of the Groam House Museum Doug Maclean, who recently attended a meeting of the community council where the future of the toilets was on the agenda remains hopeful.ldquoWe are confident that by some means or other, through a charitable trust taking over the running of the toilets and the good services of the local people, we will be able to keep the toilets open, he said.However, Mr Maclean was in no doubt about how serious an effect the closure would have on Rosemarkie as well as Groam House Museum.ldquoFrom the museumrsquos point of view it is absolutely vital for our existence. We have groups of school children that come here and of course children need to go to the toilet, he said.ldquoWe also have groups of mainly elderly American tourists and they are not in a position to make their way to the beach cafeacute. And we would lose both those groups without the toilets which put the museum in jeopardy.Black Isle ward councillor Gordon Adam said: ldquoI am in discussions with the council over the time limit of March , my view is that the council needs to be flexible.

There are many reasons why this course of action is necessary, the main one being the struggle to secure sufficient finances to run the organisation.About pound, to pound, is needed annually but Ms Cochrane said that the NHS is doing a review of third sector input, and can only confirm funding up to June.Without the support of the NHS, they will find it dficult to win the support of other funding bodies.The news will be a blow to the  service users currently on the books of ACSRS many of whom faced a personal battle before seeking help and then keeping on attending to receive the support on offer.However Ms Cochrane said they will do everything in their power to ensure their clients receive alternative assistance with their dependency. Around  people with alcohol dependency are referred to them each year.She said: ldquoThe board is actively pursuing alternative arrangements for our service users and volunteer counsellors who wish to continue their support or volunteering.ldquoACSRS has been indebted to many people over the years who have given their time and expertise freely as volunteers. Some have assisted in the management of the service as board members providing governance and support for staff and volunteers.ldquoOthers have given thousands of hours of their free time as trained volunteer counsellors. There are six counsellors and not all of them will be wanting to move on though some might seek paid employment.ldquoThe training for these counsellors was previously provided free. It now requires a source of additional funding.ldquoAs for other voluntary organisations, the burden of bureaucracy has increased without the corresponding increase in income, and the task of securing additional funding has become more challenging.ldquoACSRS is the only voluntary organisation within Ross-shire and Sutherland offering a free professional one-to-one counselling service for those affected by their own or a loved onersquos addiction. Our work complements the work done by NHS Drug and Alcohol Recovery staff.ldquoWe would like to thank all those people for their extremely valuable contributions which made it possible for us to serve our community for over  years.Councillor Margaret Paterson, Dingwall and Seaforth, said: ldquoI know this group and this will be a dreadful loss as they give a tremendous service. It is quite distressing to hear this because they have given people with addiction and their families such help for so many years. Their volunteers have given such time and talent to help the vulnerable in society, butthey donrsquot have money then they just canrsquot do it. I hope that something can be done to continue their good work.Two service users who wished to remain anonymous praised ACSRS for the help they received. One said: ldquoI can honestly say that ACSRS played a major part in my recovery.

I think I first saw the murals last year and they are quite stunning. Whoever is doing it is obviously very talented. Itrsquos a fascinating site. We know Invergordon became a naval town and was the base for the Home Fleet in World War I. These tanks were built for the supply of fuel to warships and they were in use until the mid-s.Mrs Brown said like many street artists, the person who carried out the work may wish to remain anonymous and even be fearful of prosecution.ldquoI just donrsquot know. But what they have done is quite beautul. I am sure we could find more projects for them in Invergordon including the town house which the community wants to take back into public ownership.A website documenting historical and derelict places in Scotland reveals the depot was built in conjunction with secret oil storage tanks a few miles away.It records the underground tanks were built to hold  million gallons of oil fuel and were built into a solid rock hill to protect it from bombs.On February ,  a Junkers  is reported to have carried out a solo attack on the tank farm, dropping two lb bombs damaging two tanks.

He confirmed he would table an amendment to today’s motion seeking MPs support for his party’s own customs union deal.The Prime Minister said the Brexit deal would be voted on in the Commons by  March and thatit was rejected again by MPs, there would be a vote the following day on whether to leave the EU without a deal.If the Commons rejects a no-deal scenario, there would then be a vote on  March on whether to ask the EU for a “short, limited extension”.Downing Street declined to say how Conservative MPs would be whipped in the votes or whatof extension would be offeredit came to a motion to extend Article .Mrs May said: “Let me be clear, I do not want to see Article  extended.“Our absolute focus should be on working to get a deal and leaving on  March.“An extension beyond the end of June would mean the UK taking part in the European Parliament elections.“What kind of message would that send to the more than  million people who voted to leave the EU nearly three years ago now “And the House should be clear that a short extension – not beyond the end of June – would almost certainly have to be a one-off.“If we had not taken part in the European Parliament elections, it would be extremely dficult to extend again, so it would create a much sharper clf edge in a few months’ time.”The Prime Minister added: “An extension cannot take no deal off the table. The only way to do that is to revoke Article , which I shall not do, or agree a deal.”Mrs May had faced a wave of resignations by ministers determined to vote for an amendment from Labour MP Yvette Cooper, seeking to tie the government’s hands on an extension to Article .The Prime Minister said her proposals met the timetable set out in Ms Cooper’s amendment. She called on MPs to reject it in votes today, arguing that “tying the government’s hands by seeking to commandeer the order paper would have far-reaching implications for the way in which the United Kingdom is governed, and the balance of powers and responsibilities in our democratic institutions”.In a bid to prevent a rebellion by Tory Brexiteers in two weeks’ time, Mrs May said work would continue on ways to avoid the controversial Irish border backstop from coming into force.“The UK and EU have agreed to consider a joint work stream to develop alternative arrangements to ensure the absence of a hard border in Northern Ireland,” she told MPs. “This work will be done in parallel with the future relationship negotiations and is without prejudice to them.“Our aim is to ensure that, eventhe full future relationship is not in place by the end of the implementation period, the backstop is not needed because we have a set of alternative arrangements ready to go.”The Prime Minister’s critics failed to welcome her U-turn. Mr Corbyn said that “until the Prime Minister is clear what alternative she would put forward in that circumstance, then she is continuing to run down the clock”.He also confirmed that eventhe Prime Minister’s deal was approved by MPs, Labour would seek to make it subject to a “confirmatory referendum”.Veteran Europhile Tory Sir Kenneth Clarke said Mrs May was simply “pushing back the clf edge”.The SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford told the Prime Minister to prepare for a longer extension, saying his party was selecting candidates for the European elections in May.Mr Blackford said Mrs May “could not be trusted” not to dodge another meaningful vote. He urged her to hold votes ruling out no deal now.A cross-party group of MPs will push for a second EU referendum today. An amendment by the Independent Group, supported by the SNP, Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru, instructs the Prime Minister to table a motion for debate before  March, setting out the steps necessary for preparing a public vote on whether to leave the EU or remain a member.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"peers summon jeremy corbyn over exodus of mps from labour party","story":"Jeremy Corbyn has been summoned to address Labour peers amid fears members of the group in the House of Lords could join a growing exodus from the party.At a meeting this week following the resignation of seven of the party’s MPs, Labour peers were united in anger at the response to allegations of anti-Semitism by the leadership.Only one peer at Wednesday’s meeting – writer and campaigner Baroness Bryan of Partick, who was appointed to the Lords by Corbyn in June – spoke up in defence of the Labour leader, a source told Scotland on Sunday.At the end of the stormy gathering, peers agreed to ask Corbyn to address them and explain what was being done to respond to the concerns raised by defecting MPs.Explaining her decision to quit, the Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Bergersaid the Labour party had become “institutionally anti-Semitic”.Another parliamentarian who quit Labour on Friday, the Dudley North MP Ian Austin, said his Jewish father came to the UK as a child refugee in  while his family remained in Czechoslovakia and were murdered in the Holocaust.“I don’t think I could look at my dad in the eyeI stayed in the Labour Party,” he said.One Labour peer said colleagues fear senior Jewish members of the Labour group in the Lords could quit.The source said senior figures such as former English FA chairman Lord Triesman and the one-time Labour donor Lord Levy were considering their positions.“Only one person defended him [Corbyn]: Baroness Bryan,” the source said.Peers considered sending a deputation to the Labour leader, but a majority insisted he be called to address them. One Jewish peer told colleagues that it was “dficult to go amongst the Jewish community and be a member of the Labour party”.Responding to the wave of resignations, the peers were nearly unanimous in saying they “understand what they’re doing” and “neither condone nor condemn it”, the source said.Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell admitted that the party needed to be “quicker and fiercer” in responding toincidents of anti-Semitism.In a bid to calm the anger over his handling of the anti-Semitism storm, Corbyn appointed the former minister Lord Falconer to lead a review of the party’s processes.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

Until now.All these club names have representation in the Scottish women#s under- squad which flew out to Portugal this week to take on three matches in an international development cup.And proudly flying the flag for the Western Isles women#s team is Rachael Johnstone, a -year-old goalkeeper from Balallan with a steely focus on forging a successful career in the ever-improving world of women#s football.Sport-daft Rachael took her first footballing steps while attending Stornoway Primary, where she says coach Gordon MacRae gave her huge encouragement to play.She started as an outfield player but began playing as goalkeeper for Stornoway Aths juniors in her first year at high school. She continues to train and play at the island#s capital club, as well as with the Western Isles women#s squad.Progress has been swt, and Rachael first featured for the Scotland under-s last year. Her performances have also caught the eye of the Celtic women#s team and she was recently invited to join the club#s national performance squad for a year#s trial. last week. #I can fly down and be in Glasgow on a Friday and fly back to be in school on Monday morning. It#s hard work, but I love sport and I#m determined to keep improving and go as far as I can in the game.#Being selected for the Scotland under-s makes me really proud # it#s insane really. It#s not really kicked in yet, and probably won#t until I am out on the field.#Rachael was in the starting line-up for the Scotland under-s opening match against the Netherlands on Thursday. Paul Brownlie#s side drew -, before going on to narrowly lose - on penalties. Their next match sees them take on hosts Portugal on Saturday before they conclude the three-match tour with a match against Germany on Monday.Mum Rhona was also making the journey to cheer Rachael on. She said: #I#m very proud. You always encourage them, but you don#t ever expect your children to be asked to represent their country. It#s a huge honour and I just want to support her as much as I can.#Rachael, who is a fourth-year pupil at Sir E Scott School in Tarbert in Harris, said she owed a big debt to local coaches Euan and Jenna MacLeod for their advice and encouragement as well as to her school for allowing her time off to pursue her footballing dream.Another of Rachael#s ambitions is to represent the Western Isles at the World Island Games # an event which has been pivotal in fostering women#s football in the Hebrides.#Ever since I was about seven it#s been my goal to make the Western Isles team and to go to the Island Games # that would be a huge thing for me,# added Rachael, who identied Scotland under- goalkeeper Lee Alexander as a key influence and role model, and star Scotland and Cha midfielder Erin Cuthbert as possibly her favourite player.As far as the future goes, Rachael says her priority is simply to keep learning the game, but she has already developed a keen sense of what it takes to be a top keeper.#Mindset is really important for a goalkeeper,# she added. #You need to keep the head up and keep going. If you let a goal in, you have to learn how to deal with it. Commitment is also really important.#My dream would be to get a pro contract, and be full-time in football. I just want to keep going to a higher level, and get more caps # that#s my ultimate goal.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DUNVEGAN-CASTLE-SNOWDROPS-3.jpg","title":"nae pasaranwhen scottish workers stood against a fascist","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere can#t be many pensioners from East Kilbride who are Commanders of the Republic of Chile. It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now.

I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already.

We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":null,"title":"m22 closure after four vehicles in collision","story":"The M northbound is closed between the Ballygrooby Road and Moneynick Road junctions after a collision involving four vehicles on Friday night.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles. A similar structure linking Denmark and Sweden will be used as a guide when investigating the logistics of the bridge.Ian Paisley welcomed the positive discussions.He said: “This move from a Red Light to an Amber Light shows progress and is encouraging for a future Green Light on the bridge project.”Speaking to the , Mr Paisley added: “This is a matter I have raised at our select committee and now the transport secretary is taking this forward to find a way of supporting a feasibility study. “That would be a signicant move and would be most welcome.“Obviously this is at an early stage but it wouldn’t take a blind man on a galloping horse to miss the opportunities for employment commerce and tourism!“Any feasibility study would have to look at where the bridge would leave NI and enter the mainland all of that will now need to be considered.“As a unionist it’s very obvious to see the added attraction of linking our kingdom in this physical way.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460409.jpg--.jpg?1550570234000\n","title":"children from gran canaria welcomed to ballymena","story":"A group of children from Gran Canaria have been visiting Ballymena to take part in the annual local music festival.The group of  children are pupils of the British School of Gran Canaria, and are taught by local woman Claire McDonald.Claire, who is the head of the music department at the English speaking school has accompanied her pupils to Northern Ireland to take part in the festival, sightsee, improve their English skills and experience the culture of Northern Ireland.The young people, who are all aged between  and  years old are keen musicians, with some playing the piano, drums, violins while others are singers.They have experienced success at the festival, with some winning first and second prizes and others were highly commended.The group have been travelling around NI, visiting the Giant’s Causeway, Hillsborough Castle and the Titanic museum and performed in a local concert with Kellswater Flute Band.This has been their first taste of Northern Ireland, and it did not disappoint!One of the students, Miguel said: “I’ve really enjoyed my trip. “I play the drums and the musical festival has been great.“We learn English at school so it’s good to speak it here.”Fellow student Alicia, said: “Northern Ireland is great and the festival has been a wonderful experience.“I was really excited to play with the band but my favourite part was the Giant’s Causeway and the music festival.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460481.jpg--.jpg?1550570359000\n","title":"rodney quigley announces independent candidacy","story":"Ballymena man Rodney Quigley has announced he plans to stand in this year’s Council elections.Announcing his candidacy on Facebook this week, the well known community activist posted: “I intend to stand as an Independent candidate in the Mid and East Antrim council elections on nd May.“As someone who has worked tirelessly as a community worker for over  years, and as a member of the policing and community safety partnership for  years, I feel that I have something to offer at local council level.“I have dealt with many community issues in the past and will continue to put the community first on any issues that are brought to my attention. “Ive also worked with many councillors on many issues in the past and would continue to work along side them for the good of everyone in Ballymena.“I know that many people have said its time for change and it would be good to see a few new faces within Mid and East Antrim council.“If this is the case Id like to be one of the new faces.“I can assure people thatelected, I will put my best foot forward every time and will work to resolve local issues for everyone in Ballymena.”Election datesNomination forms for prospective candidates must be ed to the Deputy Returning Officer by pm on Monday April , .The election will be held on Thursday, May , .

was unsteady on his feet and on CCTV he was seen to urinate on shelves before lting a bottle of wine and a bottle of coke.As he tried to leave he was restrained by the security guard who removed the bottle of wine from him.The defendant then shouted: “You shower of f—king b—ds. Do you know who I am  I’m Richard Chestnut and I know who you are.”He struck the security guard on the right eye.Defence barrister Seamus Lannon said his client was short of funds but had £ with him in court, although he had indicated to him that his might not ‘cut the mustard’.District Judge, Mrs Bernie Kelly, said Chestnut had been aware of this since November andsomeone turned up at court with the money in their pocket this was a demonstrable sign of remorse.Mr Lannon said that in the pre-sentence report his client did present himself as remorseful.He added that Chestnut had found a job involving double glazing and would be prepared to repay the money.Judge Kelly said the defendant was urinating on shelves in Tesco at seven in the evening when children, parents and grandparents could have been present.“It was a reprehensible act,” she added.Last call for entries as Northern Ireland Tourism Awards head to Armagh for  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"The judge said there was CCTV coverage and Chestnut says ‘do you know who I am’ because of the amount of alcohol he had he had a lapse of memory and didn’t know who he was.Mr Lannon said the defendant accepted he ‘behaved irresponsibility’ but was attempting to draw a line under this and make good to society.“I doubt that, not with his record and his attitude,” said Judge Kelly.She added Chestnut could not distinguish between a toilet and a set of shelves.“There could have been some wee cratur lting what they needed and he didn’t care. He was completely oblivious. You don’t go to a supermarket to watch other people use it as a toilet. You would expect most children to be potty trained by the age of two,” said the judge.She then gave the defendant the chance to come up with the money before the end of the court.Later Mr Lannon ed with the full restitution of £..For each of the offences Chestnut was sentenced to three months in prison, suspended for two years.Describing his behaviour as ‘absolutely disgraceful’ Judge Kelly warned the defendantshe ever saw him again for anything similar he was going to prison.At the same court Chestnut also pleaded guilty to driving without insurance on August  last year on the Lake Road in Craigavon.For this offence he was given three months in custody, suspended for two years, and banned from driving for  months.Judge Kelly also ordered forfeiture of the car he was driving."},{"url":null,"title":"varadkar and sf split over border poll call","story":"Sinn Fein and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar have once again taken opposing views on the possibility of an imminent border poll, this time at a Dublin Brexit conference.While Sinn Fein is increasingly calling for a poll, Mr Varadkar yesterday ruled it out once again.“I know some people feel Brexit has changed the rules of engagement and perhaps it has, but now is not the time for border polls,” he said. “It only serves to sew isions.”But speaking at the same conference, Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald disagreed. “If the border cannot be mitigated, it must be removed... It is time for an all-Ireland conversation and forum to look to the future... To define a new and united Ireland,” she said.DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said Sinn Fein is more focused on a poll than a sensible Brexit deal. “Indeed, judging by their hard border rhetoric, Sinn Fein seem to be cheerleaders for a ‘no deal ‘exit.” he said.And UUP MLA Doug Beattie said that with health and education “on their knees,” a poll would “further ision and instability”.

Inevitably, as he sedately passes, the lad with the ball loops one over the roof of the passing vehicle – Squinter seems to rememberthe player had hit the kerb with that shot he’d have got two points instead of one.It got Squinter to thinking – again – about the death of street games, for while the sight of two kids playing the iconic Belfast street game was enough to brighten the darkest day, the smile that it put on Squinter’s face faded a little with the realisation that it only highlighted the sad fact that such a sight is very much a rarity these days.It’s not the first time – and probably won’t be the last – that Squinter has lamented the passing of al fresco children’s entertainment: Rally-Oh!, Kick-the-Tin, -- Red Light. But here’s another street game that hasn’t been documented and yet was played in just about every house in Squinter’s street.When new gutties were required for the childer, we all got them at the same time: start of summer, new school term, bingo win – occasions like that. Brothers being intensely competitive beings, we were all keen to establish the superiority of the new footwear that had been bestowed upon us. And so we’d pull on the new gutties, lace them up with loving care and outside we’d go for a race.The winner was never going to be the fastest runner – the winner was going to be the one with the fastest shoes. We’d line up out in the square and, after the usual fussing and fighting over  starts and wrong counts, off we’d bolt, feeling aswe were being powered by some unseen but powerful motor in our pristine new gutties. Then we’d do some jumps, because of course those new gutties could not only make you run like the wind, they could make you leap like an antelope.Squinter’s not sure that kids do that now with their £-plus gel-cushioned, gas-injected fashion statements. In fact, he’s fairly sure that by the time a child grows out of them they’re as unmarked as the day they left the factory, given that they’ve spent more time on a sofa than they have on the street.Squinter’s running days are most likely over, sad to relate , which means that he will never again appreciate the unalloyed joyof pulling on a new pair of trainers. He did buy a sturdy pair of brogues recently which will face up to the rigours of any Belfast winter, but sadly aren’t designed to propel a person along a flat tarmac surface at any appreciable speed not like a good pair of Sizzlers."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"irsp claim psni are intimidating families","story":"AN IRSP member who says he is followed by the PSNI daily has accused police of attempting to “intimidate” party activists.Lower Falls man Michael Kelly was one of a number of IRSP members who were searched by the PSNI as they arrived for a meeting at Costello House earlier thismonth.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mr Kelly reiterated his parties claims that PSNI are involved in “political policing”, and accused police of harassing party members and their families.“I have been getting stalked – it’s every day,” he said.“There are days when it’s worse than others, but there are comrades who get it far worse than myself.“We have a member in St James’ and the cops have a patrol outside his house every morning when he is going to work and bringing kids to school. When he comes back there will be another jeep sitting there or another car sitting there, sometimes marked sometimes unmarked.“This week he was going to get his child from a school event and they stopped him. He pleaded his case that he was running late to pick up his kids and the PSNI boot-boys told him he would stay as long as they ‘saw fit’.“A few weeks ago, I went to pick my son up and I was pulled over and the man said ‘are you in a hurry, Mr Kelly ’ I said I had to pick up my son and told him to get on with whatever he was doing. Again they said ‘you’ll be here as long as we want’. I was there for about ten minutes and I was late to pick up my son.“It’s not just political activists who experience what this brings, it’s also our families – our kids and our partners. Our partners are being intimidated. Two years ago I was approached by MI on the Grosvenor and they followed my partner as she was bringing my daughter to crèche.“The try to intimidate our family members when we’re not there. It’s clear that the ‘reformed’ police service, as they are called by those who work alongside them, are only accommodating to those who tow the line of the establishment. Those who stand in opposition to the British police force in Ireland are fair game, and that also extends to our families.”He continued: “It’s no coincidence that this attempt at criminalising the republican socialist movement, it is starting to rise again when our party is starting to grow and we are doing fantastic work in Belfast.“It will fail today as it has done over the  years of the existence of our party. It will continue to be rejected by those on the ground who we work on behalf of.”The Andersonstown News has contacted the PSNI over the IRSP’s claims and is awaiting a response."},{"url":null,"title":"how ireland rugby hero jacob stockdale tackles being christian in rugby world","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I am a leader there with the youth group.\"Reflecting on his childhood, the player said there is a \"certain expectation placed on the children of ministers, but that he \"enjoyed\" the experience as he \"always had somewhere to live, a community to be part of\".\"But there is also the other side of it - youre expected to be this perfect child and when you dont live up to the ideal it results in rumours and I was always aware of that,\" he said.

Well, this is a very serious issue,” he said.SDLP board member Dolores Kelly said: “We are in this place seeking legal advice because of what Mary Lou McDonald has said.

We understand each other’s sense of self and sense of humour.“In politics we agree on a lot more than we disagree on. Brexit must not be allowed to take any of this away from us.”He said the current position of the Brexit process poses “unique and unprecedented challenges” for Ireland.We are but onlookers to this entire mess, something which we did not ask for or create but which nevertheless impacts on us heavilyLisa Chambers, Fianna FailFacebookTwitterMr Coveney added that the Bill is a key part of the Irish government’s plans to ramp up the no-deal preparations.The Omnibus Bill, known as the Miscellaneous ProvisionsBill, is made up of  parts and was prepared by nine ministers.The proposed laws cover a wide range of areas and focus on protecting Irish citizens’ rights, supporting businesses and jobs, healthcare, transport, education and energy.Fianna Fail’s Brexit spokeswoman Lisa Chambers said: “With  days to Brexit it is extremely disappointing and worrying that we find ourselves in this situation having to pass emergency legislation to try and minimise the damage to our country and our citizens because of the UK’s Government’s failure to raty the withdrawal treaty which they negotiated and helped to craft.“We are but onlookers to this entire mess, something which we did not ask for or create but which nevertheless impacts on us heavily.”She went on to accuse the Irish Government of giving opposition parties insufficient time to scrutinise the Bill.“It is in all of our interests to ensure that this Bill is as robust as it can possibly be and it is our opinion that greater time should have been given to this crucial piece of legislation,” she added.Labour leader Brendan Howlin said: “Economic problems will very quickly lead to a sour political atmosphere and it is likely that Ireland will be blamed, especially by those Brexiteers who have lied to the British people about the EU for many years, and who have lied about their fantasy of unregulated trade after Brexit.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland firms could head south under nodeal brexit report","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A few years ago we were very lucky to get into guest DJ at our re-rub nights.“Chris was a true pioneer and was the godfather of house in Northern Ireland and his legacy will live on. My thoughts and prayers are with the Hurley family and his little daughter, Scarlett.”Derry DJ, Paul Moran, better known in music circles as DJ Paul P, described Chris as an ‘innovator’ and a ‘legend’.“I first met Chris in  when I clamoured over the DJ box in Kelly’s to ask him to be our guest DJ at new night we were starting in the Point Inn,” he said.“Thankfully he agreed and the rest as they say is history. Our paths crossed many times over the intervening years. I will always remember Chris as an innovator, a DJ of principal who would not compromise his musical style to please the masses.“Chris set the bar high for all others that would follow. He was a real gentleman and a legend of Irish dance music. He will be sorely missed and his legacy will live long in the hearts of the thousands of people who were lucky enough to attend Kellys in the early days of the rave - a magical time made by Chris Hurley.”“He was definitely at the forefront of a le changing movement - a movement that helped break down religious and sectarian barriers during the dark years of Northern Irelands Troubles.”Another of the city’s home-grown talents, DJ Darren McMenamin said Chris was an inspiration to him and set him on the path to do what he truly loves.“Although I was into dance house music around the late s early s, it wasn’t until  and my first visit to Kelly’s, witnessing one of Chris Hurley’s now legendary all night DJ sets, that I even considered the thought of being a DJ,” he said.“Up on the Decks, top off, , people eating out of the palm of his hand...hanging on every tune! Everyone focused on him. I was instantly drawn into the scene.“After going week in, week out, for a few months, the Point Inn opened on Sundays with Chris at the helm. I was there the first night and didn’t take long to be over chatting to Chris about music and some general trainspotting on my behalf.“He was always generous with his time and knowledge and a true inspiration for me and many like me. After a couple of years raving I then went on to become a DJ myself and anytime I ran into Chris he always had time for chat and always showed me a lot of respect.“In more recent years we spoke a lot through Facebook and he invited me along to play at his Barn -year reunions in Sandino’s which was a real honour.“He was a gentleman and a true pioneer of the dance music scene and will be sorely missed.”Stephen Porter from Derry-based dance organisation Jika Jika, said Chris had the ability to unite people through his music: “We were very shocked and saddened to hear the news about Chris illness.“I was lucky to have got to know Chris over the years and he was always an inspirational figure to me and someone I looked up to greatly. His passion for music was infectious and his mannerisms would make you feel at ease.“His legacy is that of someone that brought a war-torn country together through music and firmly established dance music in NI. Deepest sympathies to all Chris friends and family.”While Ann Harley, Proprietor of Sandino’s, said: “Chris ran our Saturday nights for almost a year in . I had missed the Kelly’s Barn years, so didn’t realise at the time how well known and respected he was.“He put  per cent into every night he ran for us ,best DJs, classy posters and flyers, great attention to detail. Apart from that, from the start, he just fitted in and became a friend to a lot of us. Can’t believe we won’t see him again, as everyone says, a proper gentleman. RIP Chris.”‘Godfather of House’googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPoignant tributes also came from those in the dance music community outside Derry. Not least from Chris’ dear friends.Mark Mc Dermott from Dungiven said he was honoured to have been his close friend: “To me, Chris Hurley was the epitome of a gentleman, kindness, the most great friend, and musician. Also the epitome of class but so humble at the same time. To know him well was a true honour. He was such an inspiration to me in all angles of le and he helped me in more ways than he will ever know. “Chris had talent to burn as a DJ from such a young age and was a pioneer in music, the first to create the house music dance scene in Ireland that will forever be remembered as the Love Years, aptly named as he not only bridged the religious ide at the time with music but he brought all the youth together. He was a living legend but his legend will forever live on in my heart, and the hearts of many.“Gone but never ever forgotten - the Godfather of House, but most importantly my dearest friend and brother in spirit.”Hector McLennan, a dance music promoter from Strabane who has passed the genes onto his own daughter, celebrated Ibiza club DJ, Loéca, paid a heartfelt tribute to ‘the Godfather of House’.“Chris Hurleys name is synonymous with the introduction, development and explosion of dance music in Ireland,” he said.“He has earned a permanent place in the history of our dance culture. He was Northern Irelands godfather of house. Im not saying that he was the only one, there were others who played their part, but he was definitely at the forefront of a le changing movement - a movement that helped break down religious and sectarian barriers during the dark years of Northern Irelands Troubles.“Chris had the tunes that every DJ wanted. Ive often been in situations with people in the music business and we would hear a tune. One of us would always say, \"That was a big Chris Hurley tune.\" Like DJs of his time, his message was spread through DJ Mix Tapes. What car didnt have a Chris Hurley tape back in the day “Over the last few years I enjoyed some great nights with Chris. We reminisced about the good old days and we hit it off because we were both excited about the current house music scene. Stand out moments include driving to Portrush after Sven Vath in Eglinton to hear Chris in Portrush with John Morrison on tow, a mad Paddys weekend in Portrush in  and of course having him as a guest in Sugar on a night co-promoted with Jika Jika. His love and passion for House Music had never faltered. He didnt want to re-live his success of the past but was still an innovator pushing out the barriers and seeking out those fresh new sounds.“I will always remember Chris for his love and passion for House Music. Chris Hurley, thank you for the memories.”\"He was erudite, intelligent and so so passionate about his music...he led from the front and was key to the start of the dance scene in Northern Ireland, a movement that would have a huge role in changing attitudes and lives.\"Neal McClelland, DJ and Presenter at Downtown Radio and Cool FM, also paid his respects recognising how powerful Chris’ music was in turbulent times: “Chris was an innovator and total gentleman that loved the groove and helped shape the wave of rave that swept across our country and created the bridge between two religions that paved the path for the future through music.”Darren Drake, DJ and good friend, said: “Chris was a devoted father, a loving son, brother and uncle. Ever since our first meeting, in those halcyon days of the house music revolution of the early s, of which he was a true pioneer, Chris Hurley has been, and forever shall be, my inspiration and my friend.”Ray McLaughlin, also known as DJ X-Ray: “Chris paved the way for a whole new generation of DJs some of us wouldnt still be DJing todayit wasnt for his vision in the early s.”Glen Molly said he wished Chris could have been there for the th anniversary of the Barn: “The  years of the Barn was missing him,” he said, “I would really have loved him to have played it.”Timmy Stewart, a DJ from Belfast and close friend to Chris, said: “I loved the fact Chris was so upfront with his music.“We had heard Secret Knowledge’s ‘Sugar Daddy’ played on the Essential Selection one Friday night and he played a white label of it the very next night. I always felt privileged to be exposed to that level of cutting edge music especially at that age and time.”Col Hamilton, Promoter at Lush! Official , paid this tribute on behalf of the club where Chris first burst onto the scene: “We were saddened to hear the news of the passing of original Kelly’s resident DJ Chris Hurley.“Back in early  when Kelly’s Barn was a live band and rock venue, the late James Kelly let a young local lad start a Saturday ‘Club Night’, the rest, as they say, is history. Chris Hurley started with about  people on the first night and within six months was attracting thousands of clubbers from across the North and Donegal flocking to hear the latest UK European house music. To say he started a legacy would be only fair and Lush! would not be here  years later as one of the UK’s leading venues without Chriss original vision.“We would like to take this opportunity to extend our condolences to His Family circle and his young daughter. Until we meet again, old friend.”Liverpool DJ, Steve Vertigo, said a phone call in  from Chris went on to ‘open the door on a magical Northern Irish adventure that has rumbled on for  years’.\"When I met him we shared similar hairand were both bang in the middle of an incredible love affair with house music,\" he said.\"That first night waiting in the Barn for it to open with hundreds of people outside banging on the walls chanting Let us in!” like some sort of fantastic zombie survival film was only a hint of the craziness to come. That first booking turned into a friendship and many repeat visits hanging out for days after gigs in Portrush with Chris and Joanne. He was erudite, intelligent and so so passionate about his music. Always ready with a laugh and a plan and an appetite for good old-fashioned fun. He led from the front and was key to the start of the dance scene in Northern Ireland, a movement that would have a huge role in changing attitudes and lives.\"In  I played one last time with him in the main room at Kelly’s, a reunion and a waypoint on a long journey that now feels so short. It brought back memories of beautul, messy hazy times in Portrush when we were all young and had no idea how big this dream of utopia would grow.\"Ill remember his smile and the way hed look you up and down, head tilted slightly back as hed work out whether you were talking rubbish and how he was going to wind you up. He was a romantic and a dreamer and the gods know we need more of those.\"My heartfelt sympathies to his loved ones, family and friends. He was one of the good ones. Rise in Power, Chris. Big Love.\"The Hurley family said that they have taken heart in the tremendous outpouring of love and sympathy since Chris’ death.In a statement they said: “We are finding it very hard to take in, we miss him so much - he was so special to each and every one of us.“As I said before Christopher was our hero what a fighter to the end - he always believed he was going to get better.“We as a family are so proud of what Christopher achieved through his music bringing everyone together. Tributes that have been made to Christopher are so special to us knowing how well he was thought of and showed us everyone thought the same as us...what a gentleman he was.”The late Chris was son to Joe and Margaret, loving father of Scarlett and the late Ava, brother of Joseph, Sharon and Rhonda, a loving brother-in-law and uncle and a legend in Irish dance music.PICTURED ABOVE: The late Chris Hurley whose passion for his music made him a favourite with dance music lovers in Derry and beyond."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wMlxcXC8yNTE1MjI1MFxcXC9BZGFtLU1VUlJBWS1MR0JULnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6ImU0MDM1NTkzZTc1MGNmNzI0MzY0NmU2NTQ0NjhiYzhiMzIxYzVlYTkifQ==/adam-murray-lgbt.png","title":"lgbt history celebrated outing past event museum free derry","story":"The award-winning Museum of Free Derry will host the Derry Hub of OUTing the Past, the International Festival of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans History this coming weekend.Four speakers will each highlight an aspect of LGBT+ history in what’s sure to be a very memorable afternoon event taking place on Saturday in association with Cara-Friend.From noon, Edmund Lynch will discuss his work recording over  interviews with older LGBTQ as well as with important political supporters who played their part like ex-Presidents Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese, all telling the story of the struggle of LGBT+ people in Ireland to become full citizens in their own country.At .pm, Kate Drinane, from the National Gallery of Ireland will talk about key works from the National Gallery of Ireland’s collection, with focus on the narrative of Irish LGBT+ history through art and how art can help us explore and understand how Ireland’s LGBT+ community has been shaped by it’s past.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAt .pm, a talk by Adam Murraywill offer an insight into the mindsets and needs of LGBT+ people who wrote to Cara-Friend between  and , offering illuminating research into the period.

I would like to see this work completed soon.Cllr Curran said the petition contained the names of concerned parents, community representatives and local residents and hoped the new path can be delivered sooner, rather than later.ldquoParents are keen to see the path provided to increase the safety of children who walk to and from the school. While new speed limits have been introduced in the village, speeding drivers remains a concern, he said.ldquoThe safety of the children who attend the primary school is of paramount importance as indeed is the safety of residents who walk along this particular route.The local politician, who thanked Angela Wills for helping compile the petition, hopes roads officials will act, highlighting the importance of having a safe connection between St Maryrsquos and Chapeltown.Cllr Curran said that while the villagersquos new speed limits were a welcome addition, the provision of the new path must be a priority to help ensure that a busy rural area is safer for all road users.Cllr Enright said community groups around the Dunsford area had joined forces to support the campaign for the new path to connect the school to the nearby church and community centre. He also confirmed that another petition calling for the footpath had secured around  signatures.He continued: ldquoSome progress to deliver the new path was achieved last month with a site visit by roads officials which I organised when school principal Ronan Fitzpatrick and parish priest Fr Gerald McCloskey had the opportunity to walk the route with them.ldquoHopefully this campaign is now on the cards for success. The most recent on-site review with roads officials produced an extra  points for this project bringing it up to . This makes it a project that roads officials might look at,there is enough political and community pressure.Cllr Enright said thatthe new path project was to proceed, all parties must make what he described as a ldquogenuine effort to pull together and support the school.He added: ldquoThis project has all the features of a campaign that can succeed.

It is important everyone continues to support traders during this scheme..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9468603.jpg","title":"seans surreal abbey road experience","story":"With his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle in hand, local musician Sean Magee recently recorded a single at the iconic Abbey Road Studios, a place made famous by The Beatles.Calling the experience of recording in the same studio as The Beatles ldquosurreal, Sean explained how the opportunity arose.ldquoIrsquove just recently joined up with a guy called Rory Gallagher, hersquos from Kilcar, Donegal, and his project is called Rory and the Island for he owned the Island Bar over in Lanzarote for five or six years before he came home. He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March . Wersquore really looking forward to it.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This usually means by the Minister in the Department of Communities but with no Stormont this onus now falls to civil servants.

The budget, in the absence of Stormont, is set by the Secretary of State.

Now the department says that supposed temporary fix of the scheme was itself wildly over-generous and is proposing an entirely new approach.In the meantime, the department has been incapable of doing what to the person in the street would be the most obvious way to root out fraud – inspect every boiler.More than three years after the scheme closed, the department cannot even be certain that all of the boilers it has been subsidising actually exist because neither it nor its agents have ever been to see them – even though there are just over ,, and many of those involve multiple boilers at a single site.But there are reasons to be particularly wary of what the department published yesterday. There is no question that the original scheme set up by Arlene Foster was wildly over-generous. The boiler owners challenging that decision in court are attempting to establish that it should be reinstated. But eventhey persuade the court that they have a legal entitlement to uncapped ‘burn as you earn’ tarfs there is a moral argument for them to voluntarily agree to a less lucrative scheme. Those who refused to do so could be named, leaving them open to the verdict of the public.But, having overseen a scheme which was absurd in both economic and environmental terms, the department now seems to havegone to the other extreme.The logic of the subsidy now proposed is that the department thinks this is how the scheme should have looked at the outset. But the whole point of RHI was to be an incentive.Would a payment of £, – spread  years into the future – really persuade someone to install a biomass boiler costing up to £,, with additional hassle, higher maintenance bills and the uncertainty of a new technology If civil servants think that, they are out of step with what is happening where in Europe. Payments on the GB scheme are vastly above what Stormont is now proposing.And the scheme about to be launched in the Republic – in a desperate late bid to stave off infraction proceedings because it has been so slow to phase out fossil fuels – is also lucrative.A comparison drawn up by the RHANI lobby group shows comparative payments of over £, for GB claimants with a kw boiler installed before July , £, for someone entering the GB scheme today and £, for someone entering the Irish scheme when it launches later this year.If, as Stormont claims, anything beyond £, a year in Northern Ireland is illegal state aid, then the European Commission needs to investigate those other schemes – otherwise Northern Ireland firms are at a disadvantage.Vast cut to -year RHI subsidy will see payments collapse Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"This plan needs rigorous scrutiny, which cannot happen by MLAs without an Assembly. But civil servants have long known that this would have to be legislated for by Westminster. It is alarming that they are only now bringing this forward to be rushed through – probably in an almost empty Commons chamber.If the RHI scandal tells us anything it is that legislation needs more scrutiny, not less.try catch            ..

His cynical political games would take us back to square one.“Instead, Parliament should do its duty so that our country can move forward.“We want to leave the EU with a deal that gives us the best of both worlds: a close relationship with our nearest neighbours and the chance to make the most of our talents and resources by building new relationships with growing economies around the world.”MPs will vote on the Prime Minister’s negotiating strategy for Brexit and a series of amendments on Wednesday evening, ahead of another “meaningful vote” on Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement next month.Mrs May was warned by a ministerial aide that she faces an “enormous defeat” in the Commons on Wednesday unless she gives in to demands to seek a treaty on citizens’ rights after Brexit.More than  Conservatives are understood to have signed an amendment tabled by Alberto Costa calling for a separate agreement with the European Union to protect the rights of expats eventhere is a no-deal Brexit.Labour is also supporting the amendment and Mr Costa said it would be a “farce”the Government did not back down.He told the Press Association his amendment, which already has support from  MPs ranging from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to Tory arch-Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg, would give the Prime Minister a mandate to push for a change with her fellow EU leaders.He said his own job as a parliamentary private secretaryto Scottish Secretary David Mundell was on the line as a result of his actions.Sam McBride: Alarming elements of RHI subsidy proposal now need scrutinised – but can’t be Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Labour former minister Yvette Cooper will table an amendment seeking to pin the Prime Minister down to her commitment to give MPs a chance to vote to delay Brexither deal falls again.It came after:- A Government paper revealed that almost a third of the Government’s most critical no-deal Brexit preparation projects are not on track for completion in time for the scheduled date of EU withdrawal on March .- Tory MP Matt Warman said he would vote against an extension to Article Mrs May’s deal, which he said he would support, was defeated again next month.- Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said there was still “no enthusiasm” for backing the PM’s deal without changes among members of the influential European Research Group of Tory Eurosceptics.- International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told BBC Two’s Newsnight that he believed there was a “very good chance” of the Government being able to win the meaningful vote in March.Elsewhere, Mr Rees-Mogg told a Spectator event that delaying Brexit beyond the European elections could lead to a surge in right-wing extremism.“If we try to stay and we stay beyond the European elections, there will only be one winner from that, and that would be Tommy Robinson,” he said in comments reported by The .“I think this country has been very fortunate in not having extremism - throughout our history we’ve avoided the very far left and the very far right and I think that has been good for us as a nation but I think thatyou decide that . m people voting is insignicant and should be overridden by MPs, then you create the atmosphere for extremism.”try catch            ..

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

This is a transformative moment in the UK retail sector with the combination of two iconic and much-loved retail brands set to provide an unrivalled online grocery offer.Mr Rowe said the deal would give MS greater buying power, meaning potentially lower prices for its customers and even the possibility of Ocado-branded products being stocked in stores.Shares in Ocado were % higher on Wednesday.But MS shares were down .% as investors digested the news of the hefty rights issue and a % idend cut to finance the deal.Mr Steiner denied that Ocado was getting a better deal than its partner, saying: ldquoItrsquos an absolute win-win when you think of the synergies that we bring to each otherrsquos businesses.Neil Wilson, of Markets, said there was a risk that customers used to Waitrose products would ditch Ocado in favour of the supermarketrsquos in-house delivery service.He added that MSrsquos move was ldquocertainlybold and it gets MS in peoplersquos minds for online groceries at last but it just smacks of paying too much and acting too late..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Ocado and Marks  Spencer to form online food shopping joint venture article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Young people were also involved in the protest at Craigavon Civic CentreUp to  protesters were around the Civic Centre, most from the unions, GMB, Unite and NIPSA who quietly protested at the front of the building.During the more raucous demonstrations outside the chamber, some councillors felt staff were at risk of a window coming in and they were asked to move for their own safety.One councillor said the police should be called and another Cllr Arnold Hatch suggested the flashing lights, which demonstrators were using against the window, could trigger elipespy in sufferers.Many councillors expressed ‘disgust’ and ‘shock’ that information from a prior leisure services committee meeting had been leaked to the Lurgan Mail.Unions members protesting at any privatising of leisure services in the ABC Council areaIt had been revealed that a vote supporting an option to create a council-owned companyhad split the leisure services committee with the DUP and Ulster Unionists’ majority vote swinging in favour of the Co-Co.Unions representing staff at council facilities were in uproar and lobbied council intensely since that meeting several weeks ago to have the service remain in-house.However at last night’s full council meeting, it was decided to reverse the Leisure Services Committee option and keep the leisure services management in-house.After going into ‘Confidential Business’ the Council spent several hours without journalists discussing the matter and issued a statement following the meeting.Unions, including the GMB, Unite and NIPSA were out in force a protest against privatising leisure servicesLater an ABC Council statement revealed councillors had unanimously agreed to transform leisure services in-house.The statement said: “With the brand new £m South Lake Leisure Centre construction due to complete on schedule in summer , elected representatives reviewed a number of options on how the new facility would be managed.“This review was undertaken to ensure that ABC Council’s largest capital investment project undertaken to date would be placed within the most appropriate structures to ensure its long-term sustainability, provide full value for money for ratepayers and maximise the potential of this flagship public resource.Was using phone while driving Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"LURG | Article Teaser\"“The options included in-house transformation, creating a Council-owned company fully answerable to elected representatives and ratepayers, or appointing an established leisure operator to run the facility.Young Oliver McKenna protesting outside Craigavon Civic Centre with his dad Paul“It was agreed that Council would continue deliver leisure services directly by owning, operating and maintaining the assets, and employing all staff.“Under the plan agreed, Council will be fully responsible for the efficient operation and growth of the exciting new development and in its future.”There was jubilation among workers in Unite, GMB and NIPSA late last night as they heard reports that ABC councillors voted to overturn a previous recommendation to outsource the new Craigavon Leisure centre. Gareth Scott, Regional Officer for Unite welcomed the decision by councillors and thanked those parties and iniduals who had supported the in-house delivery model from the start.“All three workforce unions, Unite, GMB and NIPSA, at ABC council came together to build an unstoppable campaign to demand the new Craigavon Lakes leisure centre remain under council management and not be outsourced to a private or CoCo management company. “The experience in other parts of NI where leisure services have been outsourced has been unormly bad. “This represents a convincing victory for the workforce who mobilised against this decision and the huge numbers in the local community who raised concerns. Unite would like to thank those parties and inidual councillors who from the start supported the in-house model but we also welcome the fact that one of the two parties who had previously voted for outsourcing decided to reverse that stance and act in the best interests of everyone concerned.“This vote will ensure that the new leisure centre will operate in-house for its first year of operation. All unions must remain focussed on ensuring that there is no backtracking on this commitment and that the new leisure centre remains under council management thereafter. Our local public services must remain fully democratically-accountable there should be no diminution of either the status of workers or decisions that put generating surpluses above the needs of service users.“This is a victory for common-sense delivered thanks to all our members and shop stewards and those of our partner unions, the GMB and NIPSA,” Mr Scott concluded.Sinn Féin Councillor Catherine Nelson said: “We have been engaging extensively with the unions, leisure staff, council officers and other parties.“Despite Unionist support to out source the centre at committee level a few weeks ago we are delighted that after much negotiation the in-house working model enjoyed full party support.“This was a vote of confidence in our extremely capable and talented leisure staff. “We look forward to working with them to ensure the delivery of the high quality facility our ratepayers deserve.”Independent Cllr Paul Berry said he is delighted with decision“Following many weeks of discussions around the new operating model for this new state-of-the-art leisure centre I am delighted that the right decision has been made to keep the services In-House with a review in one year of it opening its doors.“Whilst I appreciate it was on legal grounds that the Option  could not be voted on, as it did not have the % support in the Chamber, this outcome is most welcome for our fantastic staff.“From day one I was supportive of keeping it In-House because I believe in our staff and have every confidence in them working with us all to ensure we have a first class facility for our rate payers. I know many of our staff and they are professional, innovative and passionate about their jobs and it’s vital we support them and ensure certainty in thier employment.“Could I commend the Unions for their work. I always had productive meetings with them throughout this process and I know they are keen to move forward and help deliver the Transfomation with us for the benefit of all.”try catch            ..

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate.

Representing the Central Craigavon area, Cllr Lennon said: “My former party has lost contact with the grassroots and no longer represents the best interest of the electorate, choosing instead to put media sound bites in place of real action.“Throughout my term as a Councillor I represented all of the constituents within my area and during my tenure as group leader I always put the community interest first.“My efforts to move away from the sectarian politics associated with the old Craigavon Council were consistently stled by the lack of clear direction from leadership and I can no longer allow my name to be associated with this isive politicking.“As a republican I believe that building a shared future and creating across-community trust is much more than just a soundbite, it should be our main task as political representatives. Following the resignations of Cllrs Curran and Cairns from Council I found myself not only frustrated in efforts to further this objective but increasingly isolated from the politics promoted by my party colleagues. The forthright honesty of the Aontú leadership impressed me and I believe this fresh political party offers a real alternative for Republicans who genuinely want to create a new Republic that is erse and accommodating of all our citizens.”Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín said: “Fergal Lennon is exactly the calibre of public representative that Aontú is looking to attract as the party continues to develop and grow - a Councillor that will bring about the most effective political representation for all the people of this island.“While the party as a whole continues to forge head, founding  Cumann in  weeks across the country, it is people like Fergal, who will help build in their local communities.“We are delighted that Fergal is now joining our team. I am confident that Cllr Lennon will be joined by several more Councillors following the local election in May.“The north of Ireland is being hammered by food, housing and health poverty. Enterprise and the economy are not getting the supports they need. With Stormont in stalemate, we have direct rule in all but name as the third Westminster budget is being implemented. The DUP are the only party in power through their Confidence and Supply Agreement and yet they are completely unrepresentative of the people of the north on a range of dferent issues. “The two governments need to implement Joint Authority to get departmental decisions made and to provide the necessarily incentive to get the DUP to fulfil their responsibilities. The All Ireland economy must be built to mitigate against the worst excesses of Brexit. The establishment parties are all wedded to theto the pre-existing Stormont. Aontú sees the need to move beyond the old failed model. Aontú is the voice of change and the addition of Cllr Lennon, a true champion of the people, to our team, proves this point conclusive.” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch            ..

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cctv.jpg","title":"from cctv to gdpr the people keeping your business safe","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Ulster Business examines an ever-changing approach to business security and what companies are turning to in an increasingly digital age Is Big Brother watching you  For many, the idea of a society peppered with cameras and other forms of security harks back to the view of a dystopian Orwellian society. But with the UK having some of the highest levels of CCTV cameras in the world, businesses in particular are ensuring that both their physical security, along with digital and paper footprints, are protected. Angela Bennett, joint managing director of Belfast-based Diamond Systems says the role of the security system has evolved hugely in the last few years to become something of a capital investment. Offering more than surveillance, the new security systems we are using provide everything from analysis of the way a firm works to conventional protection. And she says an “ever-increasing” demand around health and safety in the workplace is encouraging more investment in reliable security that is as integral to a firm’s operations as its IT network. “Businesses now treat security systems as a capital investment in technology designed to ensure business continuity, monitor workflow processes, and help manage the ever-increasing demands around health and safety in the workplace,” Angela says. “We are seeing more reliance being placed on security systems, particularly CCTV, as an integral part of site safety management systems. Intelligent system design is essential at the outset of any CCTV project, to ensure adequate coverage and image usability, even in low light conditions.” There have been sophisticated advances in video camera technology in the last few years which have offered businesses new capabilities including motion detection that records only the things that matter, ‘heatmapping’ to determine where the most traffic flows in an area to people counting and unusual motion detection. These new abilities sht the former role of the CCTV camera to a new level, allowing it to file more information about the operations and trends in your business, and Angela agrees.  “CCTV is also being used as a value-added tool, where analytics are incorporated into the video management system ,” she says. “Software analytics are currently benefiting the retail sector for example, helping to plan store layouts, the locations for promotion points, and the forecasting of required staffing levels.” Increasingly sophisticated security also demands its own security, Angela says. “Businesses do however need to be aware of the emerging cyber risks associated with CCTV systems, and how to proactively address them. Choosing a specialist such as Diamond, will ensure that cyber risks are addressed at system design stage, and that systems installed are both future-proof and intelligent,” she says. Beyond CCTV other trends prevalent in business security include compliance with GDPR , cloud security, and articial intelligence and among the top trends for  will be a boost in heightened cloud security. Wikibon, the open source technology knowledge sharing community, projects that the cloud’s share of enterprise computing will grow from % currently to % by . “In terms of future trends, articial intelligence, sensor integration and environmental smart tech are all future demands that will shape the security industry’s offering,” Angela says. “Through partnerships with the leading global innovators, Diamond are at the forefront of this new technology and we will see change coming at a rapid pace over the next few years.” Headquartered in Lisburn with locations in Dublin, Limerick and London, Mercury Security  Facilities Management is a security firm and facilities management business. And according to boss Frank Cullen, the service it provides has transformed considerably since the company was formed back in . “In order for security companies to truly provide fit-for-purpose security solutions to clients, it is crucial that they move with the times – embracing advances in technology, adapting to changing legislation and understanding the changing nature of crime itself. “Cyber-security, in particular, has become a massive issue so the importance of a high degree of IT competence within your security company cannot be overstated. By their very nature, most security systems require external connections to the public internet and are therefore potentially vulnerable. So very good firewall protection must be employed and the support of a dedicated and knowledgeable IT department is essential.” Some of the firms specialising in cyber-security here include Sophos – a UK-based business which develops products for communication endpoint, encryption, network security and email security. And for the digital and hard copy, Belfast-based Morgan Document Security works with both the private and public sector around storing, archiving, retrieving documentation, records, legal papers and files. As with others, Mercury’s Frank Cullen says that the introduction of GDPR in May last year has had a “massive impact on security with signicantly increased financial penalties for companies that do not carefully protect the rights of iniduals – and this includes how CCTV images are handled and controlled”. While it is now very easy to provide managers with access to images on their mobile phones and portable devices, doing so could well mean that you would be breaking the lawvery carefully controlled procedures are not in place to protect the image data, how it is to be observed and by whom. “From a hardware point of view, it is important for security providers to have the competence and capability to assess potential manufacturers and their equipment at the most detailed of levels and to have awareness of the regulatory requirements in which they must work.” Elsewhere, there’s been some movement in other elements of the security business in Northern Ireland. Newtownabbey firm Environmental Street Furniturehas announced the acquisition of Co Down based specialist perimeter security company, Sentry Posts. Sentry Posts is a supplier of bollard systems, perimeter security and traffic products in Ireland. Since establishing in , the company has partnered with ATG Access, supplying prestigious projects including Arsenal Football Club’s Emirates Stadium, Wellington Arch in London, as well as the Europa Hotel and Charles Hurst and Trust Ford dealerships in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.
