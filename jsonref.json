It’s hard to not think about the border when you live here’I have photographed these sisters, Sam and Lizzy, many times, in many costumes, over many years. This was a particularly difficult time in my life. It was late February, and my mum had been killed in a car crash the September before. After she died, I just wasn’t interested in photography. My mother had liked to sew when I was young, so instead I started cutting up old clothes or using scraps to make crude flags. I was just trying to make sense of what was happening in my world. I thought I might use them as props in the future.I was also going for daily walks with my dog, and a few houses down the road I came across this bizarrely tied-together pegboard fence. I see things cinematically. Bits of stories emerge from whatever I’m looking at. This image came from me sitting at my mother’s sewing machine, sewing those flags, and then finding that fence. I called up Sam and Lizzy and said: “I really need to do a picture – I need you to come over.”I’ve been collecting uniforms for a long time. I link it to my mother and my Roman Catholic upbringing, and the fact that we’re from a military family – my dad was a pilot. There was always a uniform tucked around somewhere. The ceremony, the iconography, the formality all appealed to me. This shot wasn’t so much about the specific uniform the girls are wearing, but the palette of those red jackets against that pink fence.It was the middle of winter, on a day that had started out cloudy but then we got this really nice band of light. I love how alike the girls look. They’re a year apart, but even their mother couldn’t tell who was who in the picture. They’re not professional models, but I knew I could do something interesting with them. I didn’t realise why at the time, but I needed a sense of forward movement in the poses they struck. My mother was on my mind on the day of the shoot. “It’s time,” she’d say, “time to do what you do.” She was always creative, and very encouraging. After the shoot, because I wasn’t really working, I had the luxury of being able to spend several months manipulating the image, printing and reprinting it. I was thinking about Velázquez and working on the lights and darks – the different blacks, in particular.This was in the months leading up to to the 2016 election. I’m from Texas, and I split my time between Dallas and Marfa, which is about 60 miles from the Mexican border. It’s hard to not think about the border when you live here. This image might not be a traditional version of what Texas looks like, but to me it is quite Texan, at least in my fantasy world.I started thinking about the role fantasy plays in everything – identity politics, cultural pluralism, nationalism – and these blended geographic areas that are constantly changing. I started researching the archetypes of the wild west and how they were interpreted by the Italians and the Spanish in spaghetti westerns. I watched a lot of Sergio Leone movies – I must have rewatched the last 10 minutes of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly 100 times – and listened to Quentin Tarantino interviews. And so this image launched an entire project, a contemporary staged spaghetti western, entitled Smoke Bombs and Border Crossings, which featured three main archetypal characters: the military soldier, the American cowboy and the Mexican charro, or traditional horseman.I’ve had such a strange few years. I had my own car wreck last year, very close to where my mother died. I broke both legs, in several places, and an arm. I was sort of in that same kind of mental state, where I have had to put down my camera, but I’m getting to the point where I can pick it up again. I’m trying to be brave enough to.

It has been plagued by compromises since architect Jørn Utzon’s walkout in 1966Significant buildings generate their own mythology. For the Sydney Opera House, the story that the Unesco world heritage-listed design was fished out of a rejection pile before being declared a work of genius is a pleasing fable, despite its dubious origins.What is not in dispute is that the clashes that plagued the Opera House’s origins have reverberated – not always pleasingly – down the decades. The ambition of the Danish architect Jørn Utzon’s design, his walkout mid-project, and Peter Hall’s subsequent takeover in 1966 resulted in compromises that have bedevilled the building ever since.Now, as part of a five-year program in which the Opera House has been progressively upgrading its core infrastructure, construction is about to begin on a $150m revamp of its largest performance space, the 2,500-seat concert hall, designed to remedy the shortcomings born of the project’s messy origins.The irony of the Sydney Opera House is that it has become an international cultural landmark for the way it looks, rather than for being “the best opera house that can be built”, as the New South Wales premier Joe Cahill hoped when he launched the design competition in 1954.It is very far from the best in the eyes, and ears, of some who have experienced it at close quarters. The actor John Malkovich once said the acoustics in the concert hall “would do an aeroplane hangar a disservice”. Members of the resident Sydney Symphony Orchestra have long complained that they cannot hear their fellow musicians on stage. And the rise of the rock concert has further challenged the venue, with amplified music and electronic sets being precisely the opposite of what the hall’s infrastructure was built to accommodate.That concept was thrown out midway through construction – after Utzon’s enraged departure – and the objectives of the building’s two main venues were switched. Operas and plays were moved to the smaller Joan Sutherland theatre, where rigging was installed to support theatrical performances, and the concert hall was decked out for classical music instead, the justification being that symphonies would be more popular.But, at 45 metres, the concert hall is at least 10 metres longer than most acoustic-oriented spaces, and double the optimum height. As a consequence, much effort has gone into compensating for its cavernous proportions, including wood-panelled walls to aid reverberation, and fibreglass acoustic reflectors hung from the roof to create a sonic ceiling.But in the years since it was built interest in symphonies has been challenged by the ubiquity of pop, hip-hop and rock. While rock bands – including Massive Attack and the National – are often set up in the outdoor forecourt, acts including Lizzo, Interpol, Nick Cave, Iggy Pop, the Wu-Tang Clan, José González and Hot Chip have played the concert hall.They take some wrangling.“The shows that we currently put in there were never in the initial scope for the hall,” says Andrew Mackonis, Sydney Opera House’s production manager. He leads a team of nine.“Essentially it’s designed to be a big echo chamber, and that’s the opposite of what you want when you’re doing an amplified event,” he says. “You want the space to be as dead as possible. You have these two diametrically opposed ideals.”The space has had multiple smaller upgrades along the way to help it cope, including a high-quality PA system being installed and heavy drapery created to hang over the wood panelling. But the process of getting the hall ready for an amplified show is cumbersome – the drapes alone take hours to install – and the PA system is long past its prime.The other problem is weight. Contemporary musicians, especially dance acts, will often tour with complicated sets – big LED walls and lots of light production, in addition to their sound requirements. That all has to hang off the roof – which at the moment can only support 10 tonnes.“You could say we are the masters of the compromise,” Mackonis says. “Between budget, safety, timeline and the artistic values of the show that we’re putting in there, we are the ones who have to find the compromise.”He hopes the increased weight capacity of the roof – up to 38 tonnes when completed – will mean compromising fewer artistic visions, and that the new automatic drape system will cut down on pre-show manual labour.But that’s not all. The stage, which is now flat and fixed in height, obscuring the view from the stalls in favour of the boxes, will be put on multiple hydraulics. This will allow it to be elevated in sections, to give it the traditional orchestral horseshoe shape – helping the musicians to hear one another – or raised or lowered entirely if required. The boxes will be reoriented to reduce competition with the sightlines from the stalls, and more accessible seating and passageways will be installed.In measures aimed at further improving sound for classical performances, the fibreglass acoustic reflectors on the roof will be upgraded, and new wood panelling with a rippled surface will replace the flat timber walls, to give what Herron calls “a softer, more surrounding sound – a truer sound”.The singer Solange will perform the last concerts in the space this year on 31 January, though her health has reportedly reduced what was originally a four-night residency to two. Once the show is bumped out, the concert hall and sections of the viewing deck will be boarded up for a full two years while the work takes place.While some sections of the community may balk at the idea of a heritage venue hosting hip-hop artists and electronic dance acts – especially given the scale of the works required to accommodate them – Herron is firm about the necessity of the Opera House moving with the times.“The Opera House belongs to everyone,” she says. “The Opera House needs to cater to all of the community, not just certain sections of the community.”“We need to not only maintain our fabulous heritage but we need to be as prepared as we possibly can be for the next 50 years. What is it that audiences of now and the future are going to want and how can we best prepare the Concert Hall for that? That’s been the driving force behind our approach.”Herron says she expects the Opera House to take a $20m hit to its revenue during the concert hall’s closure, but believes that – as when its smaller venue, the Joan Sutherland theatre, closed for eight months for renewal works in 2017 – audiences will ultimately reap the rewards.“The Sydney Symphony Orchestra has wanted the concert hall acoustics to be improved since it opened,” she says. “You could say it’s a project that’s been in the works for 47 years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9d5e0acbe9a8d9e42fb37f0b03e81f5aca8e848/1205_714_5054_3033/master/5054.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e6078b965437bcc1735d73527345f48","title":"costa winner auschwitz book witold pilecki jack fairweather the volunteer","story":"This week Jack Fairweather won the Costa Prize for his book The Volunteer. It is the biography of Polish resistance leader and intelligence agent Witold Pilecki, who had himself deliberately interned in the death campOne spring day in 1948, two children were sitting at their school desks in Poland when the tannoy crackled into life to announce that their father had just been executed as an enemy of the state. Andrzej and Zofia Pilecki knew nothing about the mission that had taken their father away from them for most of their childhood. It was only when they were in their 60s, as the iron curtain fell, that the details of Witold Pilecki’s extraordinary second world war mission began to emerge.Then, in 2012, a British war correspondent who was looking for a new subject after covering wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, stumbled across the story. He discovered that Pilecki, a former cavalry officer, had become a leading member of the Polish resistance – and deliberately got himself interned in Auschwitz so that he could send intelligence to London. He survived that ordeal only to fall into the hands of the Soviet regime, who took possession of Poland in the postwar carve-up of Europe.Jack Fairweather was in his late 30s and the father of two young children when he began work on the book. When The Volunteer was crowned Costa book of the year this week, Fairweather paid an emotional tribute to Andrzej and Zofia, who were among hundreds of survivors who helped him piece together their father’s story.In undertaking the task, Fairweather knew he would have to honour Pilecki’s own insistence that “any falsehood would profane the memory of my fallen colleagues”. Every single word of the book is either from Pilecki’s own writing, from interviews Fairweather conducted, or from first-hand accounts by people who lived alongside Pilecki, drawn from the many thousands of testimonies held in the Auschwitz museum.Sitting in his publisher’s office the day after his win, Fairweather sums up the five years he spent on the book: “Years of always chasing your quarry and looking for a glimpse – for one of those very special moments when you suddenly see the full man. It can be a story detail or a snippet you find in the archive.”One such nugget popped up when he took Pilecki’s octogenarian nephew back to the Warsaw flat the nephew’s family had lived in when he was a toddler. The nephew was just three the night his uncle was taken away. He remembered that his teddy bear had just fallen out of his cot. Pilecki, writes Fairweather, “quickly picks up the bear and hands it to the boy and the mother lets the Germans in. ‘See you soon,’ he whispers to the child. Then, against every instinct he must have had, he steps into captivity.”The story must have become a family anecdote, Fairweather says. “For me, it really spoke of one of his great characteristics: at times of greatest stress, when you’d expect him to be thinking of himself, he was always able to reach out and engage with other people.” Part of the puzzle, adds the 41-year-old author, lay in working out what drove “this apparently ordinary man, with no great record of service, to expand his empathy, his moral capacity, to piece together the Nazis’ greatest crimes when others looked away”.Pilecki managed to get 10 reports smuggled out of the death camp during his two and a half years there, but they fell on deaf ears and were forgotten. Their significance only began to emerge in the early 90s, when Polish archives – sealed by the Soviets – were opened to Polish historians. But one important piece of the jigsaw was missing: the testimony Pilecki was known to have written during a spell in Italy after he escaped from Auschwitz by using a duplicate key made by a metalworker friend in the camp.“The goosebumps moment,” says Fairweather, “was when my researcher phoned me from the Polish Underground Study Trust in London saying it had been found.” The document – entrusted to a colleague when Pilecki made the fatal decision to return to his homeland under the Soviets – had been handed over to the Polish government in exile in the 60s, but had been kept secret for fear of reprisals against people it named. “There it was in his loopy blue handwriting,” says Fairweather, “still in a little beige folder.”One of the most poignant discoveries for Fairweather was that the second world war didn’t end in May 1945 for Poland and a lot of Europe. “For us, it was victory parades and celebrations. But for them, it marked the transition to the brutality of Stalin, when more than 80,000 people who had resisted the Nazis were arrested and tortured. Hundreds were shot and thousands more deported to the gulag.”Growing up in Wales, the eldest of four children born to teacher parents, Fairweather was steeped in a war history that made little mention of the Polish resistance. “We always think of the French,” he says, “but Polish intelligence was much bigger and more sophisticated.”Pilecki survived in the camp by using his underground contacts to wangle the relatively easy jobs of carpenter and hospital block handyman, though they did not shield him from witnessing Auschwitz’s horrors. “One day while scratching in the frozen earth for roots,” writes Fairweather, “he had the grim thought that they’d be better off if the British simply bombed the camp and brought an end to the suffering.” Pilecki developed this thought in one of his reports, reasoning that nobody would die in vain if Auschwitz was obliterated, because it would expose what was going on, while ending the “monstrous suffering”.Fairweather arrived at the book via an Oxford degree followed by a career as a war correspondent, which began when his tutor suggested him for a job at a Kolkata newspaper. While working there as a copy editor on the letters page, he took himself off to report on the 2002 terrorist attack on the US cultural centrein the city, selling it to the Daily  in the UK “for three months of my salary at the paper”. He was given a break as a stringer in Kuwait where, “by a bizarre coincidence”, a former schoolfriend of his mother’s turned out to be a member of the Kuwaiti royal family and head of the civil service. His first big scoop was an interview in which, contrary to official briefings, the Kuwaiti foreign minister said the country would be happy to be the launchpad for an attack on Iraq aimed at toppling Saddam Hussein.Stints in Afghanistan and Iraq followed, resulting in two books. He talks of “the heroism of ordinary people” – in particular, the Iraqi driver who, with Fairweather typing out the story of an attempted suicide bombing in the back seat, managed to outrun a Shia squad who had been sent to kidnap him. “We were bouncing all over the place for 45 minutes. I was saying, ‘Please drive more carefully. I’m trying to write a piece.” Only when they’d arrived back in Baghdad and he had filed his story did his driver tell him exactly what had been going on.It’s a great tale but, he says, it is nothing compared with what Pilecki lived through. “To be able to get this man’s story was the greatest honour of my career. My books about Iraq and Afghanistan were attempts to understand what I’d experienced. But in this case, I was trying to follow in the footsteps of this man – and be confronted by history as it confronted him.” He adds: “When we think of western war heroes, they give us solace and a story about our experience. But Poland wasn’t ever able to commemorate its heroes because for decades they were ‘enemies of the people’.”Fairweather – who now lives between London and Vermont with his American wife, the journalist Christina Asquith – is well aware that The Volunteer owes part of its power to the fact that Auschwitz is now passing out of living human memory. “I wanted to speak to as many people who had witnessed Pilecki in action – and many of the people I interviewed are now dead.”He pauses. “We’re living in a time of turmoil, with resurgent nationalism and rising antisemitism. That’s why Pilecki’s story is so important. I find it really inspiring. He immersed himself in the darkest moment of human history and somehow found the courage to rise above it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d13cfd0de5b7e4a2afd7a249e1cd8eb44e54d30a/0_315_2250_1350/master/2250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e5f356a1a8141fd2aad2df94efda062","title":"djinn patrol on the purple line by deepa anappara review","story":"Deepa Anappara’s debut novel begins with nine-year-old Jai competing with his older sister in a headstand competition on the bed. From his upside-down perspective, he can see five holes in the tin roof of his house: “There might be more, but I can’t see them because the black smog outside has wiped the stars off the sky.” On the TV (“the best thing we own”) he watches a jaunty news item headlined “Dilli: Police Commissioner’s Missing Cat Spotted”. He can also see his mother shaping rotis in the kitchen corner, because their house has only one room. Still, as Jai’s father says: “This room has everything we need for our happiness to grow.”We’re in the shantytown of an unnamed Indian city, and the TV’s cheerful solicitousness about the missing cat soon seems ironic as the scene is interrupted by a scream, and the family goes outside to learn that Jai’s schoolmate Bahadur has disappeared. What’s more, the authorities are callously indifferent a police constable allows Bahadur’s terrified parents to bribe him with their only valuable possession, a gold necklace, only to insist that the boy will come back on his own. Jai resolves that, like the heroes of his favourite TV show Police Patrol, he will find Bahadur himself and unmask the evildoers. Soon he’s hot on the trail, enlisting his schoolfriends, Pari and Faiz, in the effort. The sensible and studious Pari is reluctant from the beginning, and Faiz, who is from a Muslim family, keeps insisting that the real culprits are djinni, who are unlikely to be caught by sleuthing. But as more kids disappear, and the grownups seem more interested in blaming their Muslim neighbours than in finding the culprits, Jai’s trio of juvenile detectives seem to be the missing children’s only hope.Most of Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line is narrated by Jai and leavened by his unflappable personality. He knows all about the dangers and cruelties of his world, but talks about them with the glib disapproval of a loved child who assumes that adults will protect him from real harm. Children disappear all around him, but the narrative voice continues to reassure us that this is an adventure story where spunk and resourcefulness will save the day. There are also third-person sections that follow children about to be abducted, but these end with cliffhangers: we never see a child come to harm. The book’s prologue, telling the story of a  spirit that protects the rag-picker children of the city, has the reassuring title: “This Story Will Save Your Life”.Of course, the book inhabits a radically harsh world the rag-pickers’  spirit, Mental, was in life “a boss-man with eighteen or twenty children working for him”, and his methods of disciplining those children were brutal: “he turned on them the days they showed up with their noses red, their words mixing together like blood and water, their eyes swollen like full moons from sniffing whitener. Then Mental stubbed out his Gold Flake Kings on their wrists or shoulders, and he called it a waste of a good cigarette.” But the tone remains that of a story where plucky children band together to solve crimes. In a typical subplot, Jai adopts a little street dog whom he clandestinely feeds and names Samosa. The reader absolutely trusts that not only Jai but Samosa is surrounded by a bubble of magical safety. That’s how this kind of book has always worked.It’s difficult to convey what’s so special about Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line without spoilers, but suffice to say it’s transformed utterly by its concluding chapters. In a day, our child narrator changes beyond recognition, and through his eyes, the world he inhabits does too. A book that started by feeling like a cute comic novel about a ragtag gang of poor kids who ingeniously defeat the baddies turns into an unsparing portrayal of the real world. In this world, stories will not save your life, and, if the powerful will not protect them, poor kids can never be safe. There is no fun adventure story to be told about the trafficking of children.This is a first novel, and it has some of the clumsiness that goes with that. The bad characters can feel like caricatures at moments, Jai’s voice isn’t convincing as that of a child. Sometimes, too, the political message can be a little heavy-handed. But in the end Anappara, a journalist with a background in reporting on poverty and religious violence, delivers something more powerful and complex than the vast majority of more highly crafted novels. The narrative goes beyond portraying how the poor of India have been betrayed by their government, and suggests they might also be betrayed by the stories we like to tell about them. Jai has to grow up overnight: this book asks that the reader does, too.• Sandra Newman’s The Heavens is published by Granta.

They need to be more representativeThough left and right alike declare that birth shouldn’t determine where you go to university, a fierce debate still rages about Oxbridge access. This time, complaints come from the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), which represents private schools, in response to proposals from the Office for Students to increase the number of disadvantaged students studying at England’s elite universities by 6,500 each year from 2024-25.To illustrate the absurdity of these claims, consider the current proportion of poorer students at universities such as Oxford, which counts 15 students from the UK’s wealthiest neighbourhoods for every one from the most disadvantaged. The HMC claims, somewhat hysterically, that the move will squeeze out middle-class students by discriminating against private schools, insisting that admissions should be focused on “truly suitable students” rather than “class”.We should interrogate what the HMC means by that sticky term “suitability”. The very notion of intelligence is confused with the hallmarks of a private education. The confidence of a privileged education often carries you further in a university admissions process than determination or rigour. Private schools furnish children with the rhetorical skills and professional veneer to ensure that questions of competence and ability never really matter. Given how successful the private sector has been in supplanting our understanding of intelligence with these qualities, making admissions processes fairer and more representative of society won’t just be about numbers: it will require a radical cultural shift.At the root of the frustrations about Oxbridge access is the idea that people should have the freedom to buy their offspring access to the upper echelons of the professional society through sending them to private schools, without acknowledging the inequality and discrimination inherent in that aspiration. Among those angered by the news that fewer privileged students will be offered Oxbridge places in the future, I’m sure there will be many who consider themselves fair-minded and progressive.But discussions of inequality, lack of ersity and underrepresentation are futile if they fail to acknowledge the one factor underscoring and exacerbating them all: class.• Nathalie Olah is the author of Steal As Much As You Can"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40a42a2299a6b44456b74732a4d05bedfced62e0/0_0_4979_2987/master/4979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cfb1b6381e9a863be1c3e8e9cd91124","title":"teachers tell us if you think the planned pay rise is enough","story":"If you are a teacher working in England we would like to hear your thoughts on salaries in the profession In light of the government announcing plans to raise salaries for teachers in England, we’d like to find out whether this measure is enough to stop teachers leaving the profession.

It would do this by burning wood or plants and then capturing and storing the emissions. She said Drax’s carbon negative ambition could be achieved alongside “new, high efficiency gas power capacity as part of our portfolio” and provide electricity when the wind was not blowing or the sun shining.The UK government’s actions to tackle the climate emergency are under particular scrutiny this year as it will host a vital UN summit in Glasgow in November. The world’s nations must dramatically increase their pledges to cut carbon emissions at the summit to avoid a disastrous 3-4C rise in global temperatures.In its planning application, Drax said its proposal for four new gas turbines was warranted to replace its existing two coal-fired units ahead of the government’s proposed phase-out of coal in 2025. It said the new gas plant would be “capable” of having carbon capture technology fitted in the future.In overruling the planning inspectorate, Leadsom argued that the plant’s high carbon emissions were not a reason to block approval under the existing rules. “While the significant adverse impact of the proposed development on the amount of greenhouse gases emitted to atmosphere is acknowledged, the policy set out in the relevant National Policy Statements makes clear that this is not a matter that should displace the presumption in favour of granting consent.”ClientEarth says the government’s latest forecasts estimate the UK will need 6GW of new gas generation up to 2035. The UK has already approved more than 15GW of large-scale gas plants, it said, so approving Drax’s project would take this to three times the government’s estimates.The environmental lawyers argued the combination of the project’s large scale, level of carbon emissions and long operating life made it a significant threat to the UK’s carbon targets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aeb6e5771231d72cf19c0e6f50326da71f3a34f1/127_91_1561_937/master/1561.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87b718e3d1d06f44fb6bc396aa0b24f7","title":"talking about trees review sudan film industry documentary","story":"This poignant and witty documentary focuses on four directors whose careers were stalled by a military coup thirty years ago This witty and engaging cinephile documentary begins surreally with its subjects, four older male Sudanese film-makers, recreating the famous “closeup” scene from Sunset Boulevard. None of these directors has worked properly in years, since a military coup in 1989 triggered the collapse of Sudan’s film industry for religious and economic reasons. Now a power cut prevents them from even watching a movie, so they make do. Ibrahim Shaddad wraps a blue chiffon scarf coquettishly around his face as Norma Desmond, simpering: “I’m ready for my closeup.”Films are oxygen for these men, and Talking About Trees follows their mission to reopen a neglected outdoor movie theatre near Khartoum and give away tickets. There are almost no cinemas left in Sudan. As plans go, it looks as rickety as the 12ft ladders they climb to scrub the crumbling walls of the cinema. The four amigos – Shaddad, Suliman Ibrahim, Eltayeb Mahdi and Manar Al-Hilo – repaint the peeling sign, print posters and canvass the local community to decide what film to show first. (The people pick Django Unchained.) They accept setbacks philosophically, with stoicism and amusement. Shaddad finds it hilarious when the general from the morality police dealing with their request for a permit gives them the runaround, disappearing off to pray for two hours.Which is not to say Talking About Trees is laugh a minute. First-time director Suhaib Gasmelbari takes a meditative, gently observational approach here. He chooses not to directly interview the four film-makers instead, what unfolds is a rather lovely poetic portrait of male friendship, cinephilic obsession and elegant dignity. Gasmelbari also gives us a few tantalising snippets of the films these directors made in their youth, making clear the loss to cinema it has been not to have seen more work by these remarkable men.• Talking About Trees is released in the UK on 31 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ed08249546a3c9a6772897de5fb2466366715dc/0_346_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=276fad23570db54d8ba7d79bf44d7c4f","title":"why jojo rabbit should win best picture oscar","story":"Critics are ided on this whimsical satire about the Hitler Youth but ultimately it’s an uplifting movie about love trumping hateOnly the most die-hard Taika Waititi fan would think that Jojo Rabbit is anything but a plucky outsider when it comes to the best picture race. Comedy notoriously doesn’t do well at the Oscars but a whimsical satire about a fanatical Nazi-loving 10-year-old whose imaginary best friend is a stroppy Adolf Hitler? Well, it’s hard to imagine that going down comfortably with Academy voters who tend to be risk averse and much prefer to stick with worthy prestige dramas.But people love an underdog and Jojo Rabbit is far from an obvious choice for this category. Raising laughs from such a gruesome period of history is a tricky – and not to mention downright risky – tightrope to walk, but the New Zealand film-maker takes to it with acrobatic skill and poise applying his distinctive wit to a big-hearted and ultimately uplifting tale about family, acceptance and how ludicrous racism is.This isn’t the consensus across the board. Jojo Rabbit has become one of the most Marmite nominees this year (bar Joker), with critics cleanly ided between love and hate. Peter Bradshaw didn’t hold back, calling it “a pointless Hitler-spoofy YA adventure with a 12A certificate, obtusely accentuating little-kid cuteness and optimism amid the quaintly imagined non-horror” in a one-star review. Clearly, it’s not to everyone’s taste but, as Waititi said in an interview with the , appealing to “every single person” would just be plain “boring”.Still, you can put me firmly in the camp that was effortlessly charmed because it is a genuine delight. The surreal coming-of-age, an adaptation of Christine Leunens’s novel Caging Skies, is very much in the vein of Waititi’s body of work (Boy, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What We Do in the Shadows) blending irreverent humour and goofy slapstick with an engaging story. Sure, it doesn’t have the technical brilliance of something like 1917, but Jojo Rabbit is the director’s most mature film to date and the way he navigates the different shifts in tone, ricocheting between absurdity and tragedy so nimbly that it never seems jarring, certainly deserves plaudits.Newcomer Roman Griffin Davis as the brainwashed Jojo makes a hilarious double act with Waititi, a buffoonish Hitler, who becomes increasingly moody and unhinged as he gets shut out by the boy’s growing awareness that his antisemitic beliefs might be wrong. Scarlett Johansson is so affecting as Jojo’s mother, the always dancing and effervescent Rosie, that she earned an Oscar nomination (her second this year) for best supporting actress. Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson provide great comedic support as inept Hitler Youth leaders.Yes, it is at times a bit too silly (the scene where the Gestapo show up and it turns into a mass of Heil Hitler-ing, for instance) but it always knows when to rein it in with some genuinely tender moments. At its heart, it’s a moving and empathetic story about unconditional maternal love about believing your son is a good person even though he wants to be a Nazi. It’s the opposite of ignorance. It’s about love trumping hate. Always.Chances are the Academy won’t reward something this audacious, even with it’s timely message, but that’s just a stunning lack of imagination on their part. There’s an unabashed sweetness and boldness here that is painfully absent in the other contenders, most of which are telling stories that we’ve seen plenty of times before. You can’t say that about Jojo Rabbit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7347091d35be9e47925453fb75b84f01d661f1c/10_117_3493_2096/master/3493.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8296f8f18490a6ce42ede9b91b6edf84","title":"west ham united liverpool premier league match report","story":"The day is nearing when, if he were so minded, Jürgen Klopp could copy his strategy for FA Cup replays and hand the rest of Liverpool’s league season to their second string. Games in hand are only an advantage if you win them and this one was ultimately negotiated in comfort, confirming a 19-point lead that only a wild-eyed fantasist would deem surmountable.Nineteen points ahead 23 wins from 24 all 19 Premier League teams defeated at least once. They are statistics that will swill around for the rest of this week but they should not dull in the telling, even if the figures are likely to grow yet more jawdropping in the months to come. Liverpool did not please Klopp with this display and they certainly laboured in the 35 minutes before Mohamed Salah put them ahead from the penalty spot. The number of mistakes that crept in, even once Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had doubled the lead, was enough to afford Alisson the platform to remind everyone that his excellence underpins the imperturbable machine that ploughs on in front of him. But none of it mattered too much: West Ham were allowed their moments, but this is emphatically Liverpool’s season.“I’m only happy about the three points,” Klopp said. “We could have done a lot of things better. We could have passed better and defended better. These boys have played outstanding football throughout the season. Tonight was a normal performance.”Liverpool’s version of normal tends to be enough. They took time to find their bearings, with Klopp admitting that West Ham’s 5-4-1 setup made life awkward. “A very important element of football is countering the counter but for that you need the other team to have counterattacks,” was how he put it. They had come particularly close only through Andy Robertson, whose clipped effort was chaperoned away from goal by Issa Diop, in the opening half-hour but then Salah was granted the chance to hold his nerve.The opportunity arose when Roberto Firmino, finding the elements of time and space that had hitherto been lacking, did admirably to keep Trent Alexander-Arnold’s near-post cross alive. He duly threaded the ball across to Divock Origi, who had come in for the injured Sadio Mané, but the forward still had plenty to do given Diop and the 19-year-old debutant, Jeremy Ngakia, both stood in his way.Origi attempted to wriggle between them and was stopped when Diop, wafting out a leg, tripped him on the six-yard line. It seemed needless in such a tight area but Jonathan Moss’s award of a penalty was confirmed at length by VAR, which decided Firmino should not be penalised for what appeared to be a touch with his hand in the buildup. Salah sent Lukasz Fabianski the wrong way and the die was cast.Seven minutes after half-time, Salah delightfully assisted Oxlade-Chamberlain. Much to David Moyes’s frustration, the move came about when a West Ham corner landed straight on to the head of Virgil van Dijk.They were unable to deal with the second ball in midfield and this time Liverpool had their counter. The home side were caught ahead of the play and Salah, weighting a sublime pass with the outside of his left foot, sent his teammate bursting through. Oxlade-Chamberlain shrugged off the attentions of Manuel Lanzini and finished slickly. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200127-57121-gnl.fw.20200127.sj.fw2701.mp3 It was a particularly grim night for Lanzini, who should have equalised several minutes earlier but instead scuffed Robert Snodgrass’s cross weakly at Alisson. The Argentinian’s substitution, in the 69th minute, was cheered. Dispiriting moments like that have become this stadium’s stock in trade but Moyes knows West Ham, who face a potentially far more telling assignment against Brighton here on Saturday, need all the help they can get at this point.Even if Lanzini could not extend Alisson, a first-time effort from Snodgrass drew a fine one-handed stop and, towards the end, a tip-over from Declan Rice’s header was genuinely breathtaking. There was also a moment of slapstick when Alexander-Arnold hammered against his own upright fortunately for Liverpool, they could afford to get those moments out of their system.Salah clipped the woodwork himself in those dying moments one of the night’s more obscure statistics was that he had not scored in his previous nine games in London, but he grew stronger as this one progressed. Those who had travelled in support are well used, by now, to success in the capital and virtually everywhere else. “We’re going to win the league, and now you’re going to believe us,” they sang, but any moment of epiphany came long ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/528b62a0f626c1484d383416c8305661f9cdea05/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d93e1e4d361d2bc4de65b552ea7b5aab","title":"drought leaves tens of thousands in lesotho one step from famine","story":"Rural areas worst hit as massive fall in food production causes severe hunger for a quarter of country’s population Tšepo Molapo gazes into space, worrying about where the next meal will come from. Next to him, his two-year-old granddaughter plays, oblivious of their desperate situation.Molapo’s children all died at illegal mines in neighbouring South Africa, where they had trekked in search of work.Molapo, 80, relies on a monthly government pension payout of about $48 (£37) but the paltry amount cannot feed him and the eight grandchildren he cares for on his own following the death of his wife.“I do not know how I am going to survive with my grandchildren,” Molapo says.At least 71,000 people in rural areas are “one step away from famine”, says Jens Laerke, spokesperson from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which in December launched a $34m flash appeal for more funding.“We can’t plant any crops in this drought situation. The rains only came last December and everything we had planted had wilted. We have no livestock left to sell or exchange for grain. So, unless we get help, we are just going to starve,” says Molapo.Last October, the government declared a national disaster over the food crisis, appealing to its development partners for help.But the attention of minister appears to have been erted by internal conflict and unrest in the country.The prime minister, Thomas Thabane, has been at the centre of of a power struggle with his party deputy, Nqosa Mahao. Thabane, who leads the All Basotho Convention, the major player in a four-party governing coalition, has been called for police questioning over alleged links to the murder of his estranged wife, and has said he will step down.The government has also faced strikes and threats of strikes by teachers, nurses and factory workers, who are demanding wage increases and improved working conditions.Unprecedented strike action by magistrates, doctors and police officers has also taken place in recent months. The magistrates and doctors have sued the government for pay rises and better conditions.The government’s efforts to secure budget support from the International Monetary Fund have so far hit a brick wall, with the organisation imposing conditions that include reducing the high public wage bill, public financial management reforms and the implementation of the much-delayed multi-sector reforms, aimed at bringing greater stability to Lesotho, that were recommended by the Southern African Development Community.The EU ambassador to Lesotho, Christian Manahl, told the  that February’s budget speech will indicate what the government intends to do to address the food crisis.“We are waiting for the new budget to be presented, this will give us an idea about the government’s own efforts to address the challenges created by the drought of last year,” Manahl said.The World Food Programme (WFP) is expecting to reach 174,000 people with monthly mobile cash payments to eligible families over the next six months. Those unable to access mobile money will receive food parcels.Napo Ntlou, the WFP’s emergency coordinator for Lesotho, said that even when there is no drought, the agency provides assistance to at least 200,000 people annually in the country’s southern districts.“We have engaged the government to have some projects related to building the resilience of people in the southern districts. In our five-year country strategic plan, we have a resilience component which is going to be undertaken in the southern parts of the country to ensure that at least when there are shocks, the people can recover very quickly,” Ntlou said.For Mathabo Tlalajoe, from Mohale’s Hoek, it will take more than $52 a month to feed her family of seven.“The intervention is welcome but it’s still not enough. We hope that the next vulnerability assessment will give us more,” Tlalajoe said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a5166bf220b4bfe926b0c32ba1a5eb175be302c/927_95_5974_3585/master/5974.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e736801395b8a2298a0de13fae2aa95e","title":"tattoos and the armed forces in pictures","story":"Tribute Ink is a new exhibition featuring photographs by Charlie Clift at the National Army Museum, that explores how the military community uses tattoos.

Research by the Pensions Policy Institute (PPI) charity in 2003 and 2008 concluded that people from ethnic minorities, and certain other groups, were more likely to have many of the characteristics associated with lower pension incomes. In 2016 the PPI returned to the topic, and said it had found that differences in income were reducing, “but some will remain”.Many of the findings in the study are based on an analysis of a survey of more than 40,000 households carried out by the Department for Work and Pensions.“Our report highlights large inequalities, which will become starker as the growing ethnic minority population reaches retirement age,” said Gregg McClymont, director of policy at The People’s Pension, which is one of the biggest “auto-enrolment” pension providers with £9bn of assets under management.

It is in the withdrawal agreement,” says Wilson.“Even if you haven’t reached pension age and you have paid in for enough years to make you eligible you will have the right to an uprated pension for life under the withdrawal agreement.”Not all rights are guaranteed and the campaign group British in Europe has urged Brussels and London to secure those that have yet to be negotiated, which include freedom of movement and the right to return to the UK with an EU family member after Brexit. But the rights to study, work and retire remain for those moving before 2021.We spoke to some who have already taken the plunge.“I did a spreadsheet at 4am in the morning and concluded that we could probably go now and that’s exactly what we did,” he says.Andy and his wife sold their house and upped sticks from Manchester to Spain in October.“We had always planned to retire out here, then Brexit put that into stark relief. The way that had been implemented put the fear of God into us, really, in terms of getting out here,” says Andy.“I had the vague idea of retiring somewhere between 55 and 60. We have a strict budget and I’ll have to work but we’re glad we did it. We didn’t like the rhetoric and the type of deal people like Dominic Raab was talking about didn’t seem to stack up. There was nobody to talk to – you couldn’t ring the government and ask: ‘Is this the position? Is this cast in stone? Can we trust you?’“We are not economic migrants. We considered Australia many years ago but in terms of employment it’s more complicated. The freedom of movement is key. You can cross a border into France, Spain without even noticing and you have the ability to work with no questions asked. That’s why we chose to become residents here.“Emotionally it’s quite difficult. The biggest step has been leaving all the friends and family and you want them here with you. Three months in there are days when you do feel homesick but there is Facetime and Skype.”But he and his wife have no regrets. “Our fear was the drawbridge would go up and the rights we had pre-Brexit wouldn’t be there.”Lesley and her husband Colin moved in March 2019 from Coventry, where two out of three constituencies voted leave.A former Conservative voter, she now supports the Liberal Democrats although did tactically vote Labour in the last election.“I wasn’t planning to retire for a number of years, but with Brexit looming in March 2019 we decided to make the move. We got here at the beginning of that March to make we have residency appointments booked in good time before 29 March so our rights would be secured.“I worked for the NHS for 25 years and because I moved early I’m a bit poorer but I’m happier.”She and Colin, a former HGV driver, had already downsized property when the referendum happened and had not intended to move full-time to Spain.They thought they would get a camper van and enjoy their retirement years touring Europe. But he had reached retirement age and was on his state pension, and EU reciprocal healthcare rules means he will continue to get NHS-funded care in Spain.“I’m really glad we did it but I still feel angry and sad, not so much for me but my grandchildren. My overriding feeling is that it is the young generation that will lose out. I just feel sorry for them,” says Lesley.Moved earlier than planned in February 2018 because of Brexit.“Almost two years ago I found myself in a bit of a panic because of Brexit. I felt I wanted to move to the EU and I needed to do it pretty quickly.“I spent 40 years working in pharmaceuticals and was used to looking at things 18 months, two-year windows at a time. I thought: if we don’t do this within six months, the door is going to be slammed, the drawbridge will be up.”A orce and his age makes it difficult financially to buy a decent property where he wanted in London where his daughter is, but in Spain, where he rents an apartment for €600 (£500) a month, there are all sorts of possibilities. “Not only can I afford to rent but I can buy as well.”Served in the US, Canada, Sudan and Turkey, travels to Cartagena two or three times a year and has been going to Spain since he was 21.Peter had wanted to retire to Spain for some time but delayed it because his daughter was not so keen. “Then the referendum happened,” he says. He is putting his house up for sale and intends to move before the end of the transition period.“Leaving England would be a wrench. I often analyse why I feel so strongly about getting out of this country. The last sentence says it all because I didn’t say ‘why I feel so strongly about going to Spain’. The reality is that I want to leave the UK because I don’t feel I belong here any more owing to the fact that democracy has been so undermined, and since Boris Johnson has become prime minister my fears have worsened.“I often questioned whether I was just getting over-emotional because I was being deprived of something I wanted. But that is not the case. I have been angry since 24 June 2016 and nothing has happened to appease me.“When I look at the mess Brexit has created, I thought I would literally leave lock, stock and barrel and move my pension into Europe.“I’ve been an activist since 2016. I joined the Lib Dems and read the . I used to read the Daily  and for 40 years voted for the Tories. I consider myself right of centre but when I look at it I’m a social democrat. They have moved to the right and that leaves me left of centre.“This is not the same country that I was born in. It sounds overly dramatic, but I just do not feel comfortable in any way here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4846e73088f977dbc4a8b9e4e839eb74b2b01bc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1dba4eb9a7d4e63f486b661a457466e","title":"i finally had control it was my account starting over again in emergency accommodation","story":"For a woman staying in refuge, sorting out a new bank account is made all the more difficult when you can’t reveal the addressI suffered domestic abuse for several years when I was with my husband.

Then in the final appointment they said the manager had now refused because I didn’t have an address. I was so upset and frustrated. It was like I didn’t matter, nobody cared. It was humiliating and again I had no control. I was worried how I would manage without the universal credit money. I had to feed my children. We had been surviving with support from my family and donations.Staff at the refuge then told me that HSBC UK had started a new way to open an account for women in refuges, a way in which we did not have to give the refuge address. An appointment was made and I attended a branch of HSBC UK far away from the shelter with staff support. They were patient and really kind to the kids and me. During the appointment I did think they would say no at any moment, but when they said the account was open I was so relieved.I finally had control. It was my account. I could make my own decisions, and buy the kids the things they needed, without having to beg or fear his anger.HSBC UK is working with local housing and homelessness charities to provide bank accounts to people without a fixed address, helping to break the cycle of financial exclusion.

Rising columns of plasma, superheated to almost 6,000C (10,800F), show up as bright spots at the centre of each grain – epicentres for the violent release of heat from the sun’s interior to its surface. As the plasma cools, it descends back below the surface via narrow, shadowy channels between neighbouring granules.This intricate level of detail will help improve understanding of the sun’s behaviour and allow its activity cycle to be predicted more accurately.The US National Solar Observatory’s $344m (£265m) telescope features a four-metre mirror – the world’s largest for a solar telescope – and is located at the 3,000-metre (10,000ft) summit of the Haleakalā volcano on the island of Maui.Valentin Pillet, the director of the National Solar Observatory, described the telescope, which had been under construction since 2013, as a “formidable technological achievement”. A major challenge was maintaining the telescope’s primary mirror at ambient temperature while it looked directly at the sun – any temperature deviation causes air turbulence that could ruin the image quality. The heat is intense enough to rapidly melt metal at the mirror’s focal point.Each night, a swimming pool’s worth of ice is emptied into eight tanks. During the day, coolant is routed through the ice tanks and distributed through the observatory by 7.5 miles (12km) of piping. More than 100 air jets are also positioned behind the main mirror.Incoming light from the sun is deflected from the primary mirror into a chamber of mirrors that sits below the observatory’s dome. Here, the light is bounced from mirror to mirror as it is apportioned between spectrometers, polarimeters and other various other instruments. The observatory’s full suite of instruments, which will allow scientists to measure the magnetic field from the sun’s surface up to its outer atmosphere, will come online later this year.The observations could help resolve longstanding mysteries of the sun, including the counterintuitive feature that the corona – the sun’s atmosphere – is heated to millions of degrees when its surface is only 6,000C. Understanding the physics of solar flares and coronal mass ejections could also significantly improve the ability to predict space weather, which can render GPS systems unreliable, take down power grids and knock out communication channels.The release of the images comes as Nasa’s Parker solar probe makes observations from the edge of the sun’s atmosphere, and before the launch of the Solar Orbiter mission, a European Space Agency-Nasa collaboration, next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a50f6bd268551c51ea95947ed4f173b67aa36a81/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7d2a360d47b053f2f41dfbdcbeec35b","title":"most children own mobile phone by age of seven study finds","story":"The majority of children own a mobile phone by the age of seven, according to a study.The devices have become a fundamental part of life for most young people, it indicates.

A few days in the Algarve paid off a year ago when they secured a resounding round‑one win in Dublin but even the best-laid plans can be disrupted at any time.In this instance the Exeter hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie, who had been pressing for Jamie George’s starting place, has had to return to the UK for family reasons, opening up the prospect of Bath’s Tom Dunn winning an unexpected first cap off the bench.Mako Vunipola also missed training because of an eye problem, although England’s management insist he is not a serious doubt for the game at Stade de France on Sunday.All this comes, appropriately enough, at the exact moment that England have been talking about the importance of being more adaptable when circumstances demand it. There is now widespread recognition they did not respond well when things started going awry in the World Cup final against South Africa in November and Paris will be a litmus test for their progress in this vital area.As their fly-half George Ford has been reiterating, there is a lot more to winning games of rugby than simple physicality, particularly when the intended target is a fast-moving one.“Being brutal doesn’t always mean trying to knock the wall down and trying to run over the man straight in front of you,” Ford said. “You have to be smart and controlled and take the sting out of the game a little bit, or maybe throw something at a team that they are not quite expecting. Defensively it is more a case of ‘Right, let’s go get ’em and whack ’em’, but from an attack point of view you can be brutal and smart at the same time.”With Shaun Edwards now in charge of marshalling France’s defensive operation it could be that England’s management decide it is not a day for messing around or blooding too many new caps. It is more than possible that Courtney Lawes will be asked to wear No 6 with the combative Tom Curry at 8 and any huge starting XV experimentation behind the scrum feels unlikely.If Anthony Watson, Elliot Daly and Jonny May are raring to go the starting back three – in whatever order – virtually picks itself and it will be a surprise if the 10-12 combination of Ford and Owen Farrell is not reunited, if only to ensure England have sufficient kicking options to put France on the back foot.If any further incentive is required World Rugby has announced that the pool draw for the 2023 Rugby World Cup will take place after this November’s international fixtures. This puts an added onus on all teams to enjoy a successful 2020 if they wish to avoid ending up with a potentially tougher draw for the tournament, which will be hosted by France.Watson, meanwhile, hopes his Wiltshire-reared teammate Dunn will finally be given the chance, at 27, to export a bit of no-nonsense Chippenham aggression across the Channel this weekend. “If you wanted one person to run through a brick wall he’s probably the first person I’d ask,” said Watson. “It doesn’t matter how high or deep it is he’s going to run full pelt into it regardless.“He’s not the most explosive but he’s not going to take a backward step to anyone and I think you’ve seen that for Bath this year. His work‑rate is phenomenal and he’s also got probably the hardest – and biggest – head in world rugby. He’s like a ram he always gets stuck into things.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6709c771833e88cbf1aba2532a4d1d005b9e9b8/0_100_3516_2110/master/3516.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b940761a5bfb373280ecca84cd3a847e","title":"australian cricketers face sanctions after ridiculing non english speakers","story":"Some members of Australia’s Under-19 World Cup squad face sanctions for comments on social media that have been branded as casual racism. Cricket Australia’s head of integrity and security Sean Carroll has spoken with those players who recently posted broken-English responses to an Instagram post.“We are extremely disappointed that some of the Australian Under-19 squad members have used inappropriate language in posts on social media, which we reported to the ICC as soon as it came to our attention,” Carroll said in a statement. “Some of that language could be interpreted as ridiculing non-native English language speakers.”In response to an Instagram post by Jake Fraser-McGurk –\u0026nbspwhose tournament was ended earlier this week after being scratched on the face by a monkey at a nature reserve – which said “Quarter-finals here we come”, batsman Oliver Davies wrote: “Sir great player, big fan, and will play India one day.”Spinner Tanveer Sangha added, “You hit ball very hard sir” while all-rounder Liam Scott wrote, “Sir give me whatsapp number I want to be friend”. Middle-order batsman Lachlan Hearne then posted, “Young Steve Smith sir” and opening bat Sam Fanning: “How u bat so good young man.”The posts, now deleted, were made before the team’s defeat to India at the Under-19 World Cup which is being held in South Africa. “I have spoken to the players this morning and expressed in no uncertain terms that such language has no place in society and falls well short of the standards we expect as Australian cricketers,” Carroll said.“Cricket Australia will consider sanctions upon their return home from South Africa, which will include but not be limited to education and cultural sensitivity training. Most of the players do not have their parents present with them in South Africa and some of them are minors. Accordingly, we believe it is appropriate to consider sanctions upon their return home.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68e678f48f4cc465922c706d024fbacedbffdd38/0_68_2611_1566/master/2611.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efffd3dc60c9cc284c5f7a2a2b876421","title":"australian open women semi finals","story":"Ashleigh Barty fell just short of pleasing millions of Australians when the American Sofia Kenin gritted her teeth on the hottest day of the 2020 Australian Open to win their semi-final 7-6 (8-6), 7-5 on Rod Laver Arena on Thursday.Her opponent in the final on Saturday night is Garbiñe Muguruza, who beat the world No 3 Simona Halep in the second semi-final 7-6 (10-8), 7-5. The Spaniard, who arrived with a viral illness and was unseeded in a slam for the first time in six years, took the title favourite out of her stride at key moments in both sets, despite 44 unforced errors in just over two hours.Had Barty been able to drag the match into a third set, they would have had to take a 10-minute break according to the regulations of the tournament. The heat stress reading hovered just below five, which would have required the match to be suspended. Neither player wanted that. Both fought hard all the way.Kenin’s Russian-born father, Alex, (who calls her Sonya) arrived in America with $300 in his pocket – mirroring the experience of Maria Sharapova and her father – and he could hardly stop beaming in the stands. The journey has a little way to go, but this was a landmark event, passage into her first slam final at 21, saving two set points in each set against the world No 1.Those familiar with her from-childhood tennis have always regarded her highly, including her TV inquisitor on Thursday, Jim Courier, who shared a doubles court with her in Florida when she was seven – and they won, against Venus Williams and Todd Martin.She is hardcore tennis, surrounded by and cherished by the game’s tight-knit community. They will have much to celebrate in the years to come.Kenin, constantly looking towards her father, said in her courtside interview: “She’s such a tough player. She’s playing really amazing tennis and I just had to find a way. I’m speechless. I can’t believe this. I’ve worked so hard to get here. In the second set, she came up with some really great shots. There’s a reason why she’s world No 1.”The first set was a struggle for both of them – quite apart from the skin-burning heat, and was settled in the tie-break as Barty, who blew two set points giving the American space to work, abandoned her safety first strategy, went for one big crosscourt winner too many and billowed the net after just under an hour – and just under the century Fahrenheit mark.As the temperature headed north, stamina was now the third element in this contest. Wheelchair matches were suspended on outside courts about this time. Britain’s Joe Salisbury, who won his doubles semi-final with Rajeev Ram, said: “It’s been relatively cool the rest of the time here, even most of the time being in Australia for the other tournaments. It was a bit of a shock for all of us today.”Neither Barty or Kenin had returned as well as they would have liked in the first set, and the margins between them were slim, determined by the odd big serve or a mistake under pressure.On they slugged, Barty breaking early in the second and hanging on to it tenaciously with a slew of backhand slices against an opponent whose young legs were tiring, but whose grit grew by the rally. She wanted to wrap it up in two Barty needed to get into the third. She saved a string of break points, before thrashing a drive volley into the net.So close to a grand slam final, Kenin grew in confidence, and won nine of 10 points, holding to love. Barty had to hold her serve just to extend the torture. It was tough to watch as she went 15-40 down and the arena fell pin-drop silent. She saved one match point, persuading an angled forehand into empty space, but stretched on the deuce side, she put her final shot long.It was ugly. Her compatriot, Brad Gilbert, would have been proud of her. Kenin won, on heart and patience, beating the elements and the crowd favourite. “Both players battled the elements today,” he said later. “She just kept herself in it. When Barty’s level dropped, she found a way. If she was a UFC fighter, she’d get you to tap out.”The second match was supposed to be a tune-up for Halep against the unseeded Spaniard, but she had to win eight points in a row after being broken to level at 5-all in the first set.Although they both have won slams on clay and grass, Muguruza has had her measure on hardcourt, winning the three times they met. Now her tennis was unravelling in a blizzard of mistakes – 29 in the first set – before Halep cracked at the end of an absorbing tie-break.Halep had played with a smile on her face all tournament now she needed to fight. Shade crept across most of the court but it was still killingly hot in the late afternoon sun. While large swathes of seats in the exposed side of the arena were empty, ticket-holders taking refuge in the cool of the nearby bars, there was nowhere to hide for Halep and Muguruza.The Romanian was within sight of winning the second set when Muguruza found some of her best tennis to break for 5-all. From there to the end, the match was on a knife edge, each player scrapping for every point. Halep drove her final shot into the net and those who had endured the heat rose to acclaim Muguruza.Muguruza said courtside: “I wasn’t thinking that I was down. I was thinking, ‘keep going’, fighting with all the energy I had. Luckily I have 48 hours to recover.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a04190588dc5266954fa5733b115b06c55a08669/0_239_4830_2898/master/4830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2b5d0f1962d7215adbb53f943d6d32e","title":"san francisco 49ers super bowl liv team analysis nfl football","story":"Kyle Shanahan and John Lynch have developed a team with almost no weaknesses. The Chiefs will have to be superb to beat them on SundayWhat a remarkable turnaround this season has been for the San Francisco 49ers. A year ago, the team was already well into their offseason. Questions were starting to bubble about whether the coach-quarterback-GM axis of Kyle Shanahan, Jimmy Garoppolo and John Lynch was all promise and no substance.The Niners never wavered. There were no leaks, no dispensing of blame, none of the typical stuff that comes when a franchise has yet to ignite and is picking at the top of the draft again. Instead, they doubled down on their plan. The makings of something were there: the head coach was obviously a schematic savant Lynch said all the right things, and had a defined vision Garoppolo flashed talent. They stuck to the “process”, the most overused word in US sports. And, wow, did it ever work: From a 4-12 record to 13-3 in one year.The Niners have mauled teams on both sides of the ball all season. Only the 2007 Patriots have ranked in the top seven on offense and defense in down-to-down efficiency and failed to win the whole thing. The 49ers enter Sunday’s game seventh in offensive DVOA and third in defensive DVOA.It is that balance that defines this team. The exotic stuff comes on offense: they have paired the quickest running-back group in the league with a erse passing game and all kinds of nifty play-action concepts. Add to that an offensive line that can dance with the best of them and a tight end who’s not only the most efficient route-runner in the NFL but the best blocker of any skill position player.The star of the show is Shanahan, though. Architect of one of the greatest offenses in modern NFL history in Atlanta, it’s taken him a while to get all his pieces in place in San Francisco. This year, however, Shanahan has everything he wants: speed all over the field a weapon who can win one-on-one and an offensive line that prioritizes side-to-side movement over raw power.It’s the system and coach that’s key, not the quarterback. Shanahan has tried to turn Garoppolo into 2017 Alex Smith. Get the ball out on time, and I promise you the players will be open. Just don’t chuck the game away. Garoppolo has been efficient while trying to curb some of the freelancing tendencies that can lead to turnovers – he has 13 interceptions so far this season. When he curbs those base instincts, the Niners offense has been close to unstoppable.Shanahan’s brilliance is not in particular play designs, most of which can be found elsewhere in the league. It’s the timing of the plays he calls. No detail goes unnoticed. The hands of a defensive back here, the body language of the defensive coordinator there. Shanahan sees those little things on tape that lesser coaches miss:Each tip allows the coach to run the same plays over and over again, but sequence them in varying orders to keep his opponents guessing.Things aren’t much different defensively, albeit with more star power. It’s hard to scheme up a pass-rush the way you can a passing game on offense. Either you need superstars up front who can win one-on-one or two-on-one (like the 2007 Giants) or a secondary littered with future Hall of Famers, who take away everything on the back-end and buy the pass-rush an extra couple of beats – think of Seattle’s Legion of Boom. The Niners have tried to build the best of both worlds. They’ve imported that simplistic Seattle scheme on the back-end but added a batch of first-round pass-rushers to the mix.Nick Bosa is the star of the show, a rookie already playing at an All-Pro level. He has a special combination of springs, hands, and tenacity. His relentlessness has infected the entire team they fly around with a recklessness that borders on violence. They’re not out to stop you, they’re here to break you. It’s an old-school style, built in the image of Lynch, who was a bone-crushing safety during his playing days.Lynch has built this roster carefully and methodically, using all the avenues available. The core of their defense has come through the draft – Bosa, Jimmy Ward, Arik Armstead, Fred Warner— with a sprinkling of free agent and trade additions to push it to the next level: Richard Sherman, Dee Ford. All of them have been significant contributors, on and off the field.They built a rudimentary scheme, but one that amplifies the ability of their stars. Playing fast is all that matters. Shut your eyes and you can picture any of the Niners’ 15-wins this season: force turnovers on defense, control the ball on offense. When the Niners have been in trouble it’s been because Garoppolo has thrown a dopey interception or two. Stick to the script, get out the way, and Garoppolo’s teammates have been too overwhelming for anyone to contain.Contrast that with Sunday’s opponents. They have an all-time great quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, already at the top of the NFL just three years into his career. Land such a prospect and everything else slots into place easily, every decision you make as a franchise looks smart.Everything the Chiefs do is about Mahomes and their passing game, a terrifying supernova that’s ready to explode at any time. Only the Mahomes-led crew and the Chiefs’ special teams are a real threat. The defense has talent, but it’s more dependent on inidual matchups than the Niners’ unit.San Francisco have built the most complete roster the NFL has seen in recent years, staying true to the ideals of their general manager and coach. It will take a remarkable Mahomes performance to deny them a Championship."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8d2088c13d585d0f8013171a7fa20c53c66d5b0/123_280_3153_1892/master/3153.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=911523cd2d3e04af4110861411d27698","title":"roger federer novak djokovic australian open semi final live","story":"At 30-15, the pair are both flirting with the lines, and Djokovic then hits deep to Federer’s backhand, which loops well long. Djokovic quickly serves it out from 40-15. That’s three games on the spin for Djokovic. Just as he was for much of last year’s Wimbledon final, he’s been the inferior player for most of this set, but he could still find a way to silence Federer.As Federer steps up to serve for the first set, the crowd chant “Let’s go Roger, let’s go.” Cue Ross McGillivray. “Is there a more inane chant than ‘let’s go (insert name) let’s go ...’” he emails. “If I was in charge I’d chuck em out.” Perhaps to demonstrate the inanity of said chanting, Federer flops 0-40 down. He can’t find a first serve. And then Djokovic does what Djokovic does, stepping up in the big moment, laughing in the face of adversity, and breaking Federer to love after a long rally in which Federer eventually nets. They’re back on serve.One positive for Djokovic: he is, at least, serving with new balls. But even they don’t give him the instant boost he needs. 0-15. 0-30. Djokovic darts forward and thumps away a winner – but has his heart in his mouth for a brief moment when it looks as if he may touch the net and therefore concede the point. 15-30. 30-all. 40-30. Djokovic has missed only six first serves so far but still has his back against the wall. Deuce. Advantage Djokovic. Djokovic lives to fight another game in this set.Federer has been averaging 10 aces a match in Melbourne but he’s already up to seven in this semi-final. 15-0. 30-0. 40-0. He’s serving so sweetly. And a netted Djokovic return gives Federer a love game in just over a minute. Djokovic must hold serve to prevent Federer from taking an unexpected one-set lead in this match.0-15. 0-30. 0-40. Federer has nothing to lose and is going for broke. Djokovic looks shell-shocked. Djokovic’s box has something to cheer about when a well-judged challenge gets him back to 30-40. But there’s still a third break point to save, Federer steps in and attempts to put away the forehand ... and thwacks into the net! From 0-40 to deuce. This would be a massive hold for Djokovic. The Serb is a little lucky to get to advantage, is pulled back to deuce, edges to advantage once more, and holds when Federer flings a backhand wide. What looked as if it may be about to become a 5-1 deficit is now 4-2. How crucial could that be in this set?The spectators are screaming in delight when Federer’s smash gets him to 40-30. And a third ace of the game backs up the break.Raging against the lack of love from the crowd almost makes Djokovic a better player though. “When the crowd is chanting ‘Roger’ I hear ‘Novak’,” said the Serb after his Wimbledon win. “It sounds silly, but it is like that.” He appears on course for the most straightforward hold of this match so far at 40-15 but that quickly becomes deuce and then break point Federer. Djokovic survives and does so again on a second advantage for Federer, but is unable to resist a third break point when, off balance, he makes a mess of his backhand. That’s three breaks in a row and 11 points lost on Djokovic’s serve so far in two games. The crowd are happy but Djokovic is not.“Seeing how tremendously well Federer is playing with just having broken Djokovic, makes knew wonder whether or not he was injured in the previous game ...or was it all a tactic for that opponent and this opponent?” emails Xhindoli Lela. “Tennis is such a mental game and this match will surely be nothing short of that.”Neither of these players is having it easy on serve. No sooner does Federer break than he is broken to 30, with Djokovic demonstrating why he’s considered the game’s greatest returner. The crowd roared in delight when Federer broke Djokovic’s break is greeted by silence. Poor Novak. He’s the seven-times champion here – what does he have to do to get some love against Federer? Someone give him a hug.Federer appears to have that suspect groin strapped but he’s moving freely and flicks away a backhand winner for 15-30 on Djokovic’s serve. Djokovic goes for the sideline but skews his forehand just wide. 15-40. Now Federer has two break points after Djokovic had the same in the opening game. And Federer strikes on the first when he somehow threads a backhand through the eye of a needle to pull off a passing winner with virtually his back to the court! Wow. So it’s Federer to get this semi-final under way. And it’s not the most auspicious of starts. He slides 0-30 down. A strong serve reduces his arrears to 15-30 but then a longer exchange plays out on the next point – these are the kind of rallies where you’d put your money on Djokovic – and Federer eventually flaps into the net after a 17-shot encounter. Two break points for Djokovic right from the off. 15-40. Federer fends off the first and fires away a cross-court forehand winner off Djokovic’s return on the second. Deuce. Advantage Federer. Deuce. Advantage Federer. Deuce. Given Federer’s fitness issues he could do without such a long opening duel. Advantage Federer. Deuce. Advantage Federer, courtesy of a third ace. Federer eventually holds after a six-minute game. For the second consecutive match Djokovic is wearing the initials KB on his tracksuit in tribute to his friend and mentor Kobe Bryant. He takes it off for the warm-up, and is once again in green, with Federer in navy and purple. Do remember you can get in touch with any musings via email or Twitter. Let’s talk!Here they come, making their way through the corridors of the Rod Laver Arena, with Federer, the six-times champion, stepping on to court just before Djokovic, the seven-times winner. It’s 7.41pm in the evening in Melbourne and it’s still 38 degrees. Federer says: “Novak also has gone on all these runs like I did for 10 years. He did the same for the last 10 years. I think conditions suit us well here. Start the year strong. Probably something to do with court speed, feeling comfortable down here. It helps when you start the year off with a bang like he did at the ATP Cup.” Djokovic says: “He is one of the all-time greats and the match-ups against Roger and Rafa have made me the player I am today. You know he’s always going to play at such a high level, regardless of the surface.”So what does Federer need to do? He’ll have to hit the spots with his serve, be laser-like in hitting the lines, take risks and hold his nerve in the big moments. And perhaps put some stones in the Serb’s shoes. But back to Federer v Djokovic. This will be the 50th meeting between the pair. Djokovic leads the head-to-head 26-23, which includes a 3-1 record in Melbourne, and each of those three wins came in the semi-finals (Djokovic has a perfect 14-0 record in semi and final matches at the Australian Open). Federer has also not beaten his rival at a slam since 2012, but it’s not all bad news for him he did win their last meeting, at the ATP World Tour Finals in November. However that was on a faster court in a best-of-three-set match. This is very different.No Brit managed to make it out of the second round of the singles last week, but Britain will have a finalist in Melbourne because Joe Salisbury and his American partner Rajeev Ram have won their men’s doubles semi. The 11th seeds beat Kazakhstan’s Alexander Bublik and Mikhail Kukushkin 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 on theKevin’s been busy. Here’s his preview of Federer v Djokovic:And he’s also been giving his thoughts on Martina Navratilova and John McEnroe’s protest against Margaret Court:Here’s a report from our man in Melbourne, Kevin Mitchell:Ashleigh Barty fell just short of pleasing millions of Australians when the American Sofia Kenin gritted her teeth on the hottest day of the 2020 Australian Open to win their semi-final 7-6 (8-6), 7-5 on Rod Laver Arena on Thursday.Her opponent in the final on Saturday night is Garbiñe Muguruza, who beat the world No 3 Simona Halep in the second semi-final 7-6 (10-8), 7-5. The Spaniard, who arrived with a viral illness and was unseeded in a slam for the first time in six years, took the title favourite out of her stride at key moments in both sets, despite 44 unforced errors in just over two hours.Had Barty been able to drag the match into a third set, they would have had to take a 10-minute break according to the regulations of the tournament. The heat stress reading hovered just below five, which would have required the match to be suspended. Neither player wanted that. Both fought hard all the way.Kenin’s Russian-born father, Alex, (who calls her Sonya) arrived in America with $300 in his pocket – mirroring the experience of Maria Sharapova and her father – and he could hardly stop beaming in the stands. The journey has a little way to go, but this was a landmark event, passage into her first slam final at 21, saving two set points in each set against the world No 1.You can read the rest here:And we’ve also got some reaction from Barty:Perhaps Federer can take heart from the fact it’s been the day of the underdog. A short time ago in the women’s semis Garbine Muguruza, unseeded at a slam for the first time in six years, upset the Wimbledon champion Simona Halep, 7-6 (8), 7-5, fighting off four set points in the opening set and twice coming from a break down in the second. Earlier the inspired Russian-born American Sofia Kenin edged out the world No 1 Ashleigh Barty by almost the same score, 7-6 (6), 7-5, in the most sweltering conditions of the tournament so far (just hearing that the mercury hit 40 degrees is warming me up after my winter walk into  Towers). It will be a first grand slam final for the 21-year-old Kenin, a first Australian Open final for the former French Open and Wimbledon champion Muguruza, while for Barty and Australia, the 42-year wait for a home female champion will go on.It’s been a tough week or so for poor Roger Federer. First he was forced to come from 8-4 down in a final-set tie-break to get past Australia’s John Millman in the third round then he had to save seven match points against the world No 100, Tennys Sandgren, in the quarter-finals when he showed rare physical and mental vulnerability by playing on almost one leg and getting a slap on the wrists for swearing and now he’s got to face the virtually unbeatable Melbourne machine Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals. The same Novak Djokovic who, in their last grand slam meeting six months ago, had the audacity to save two championship points before denying him in that Wimbledon final. The indignity of it all! At least Dominic Thiem did him a favour by bundling out Rafael Nadal yesterday and ending the Spaniard’s bid to draw level with Federer’s record of 20 grand slam titles – for the time being at least. Had the GOAT become only the joint GOAT by Sunday, that really would have added insult to injury.In contrast Djokovic has been doing what Djokovic does at the Australian Open, moving through the draw with ominous intent. The Serbian cyborg has not dropped a set since his opening match against the big-hitting German Jan-Lennard Struff, has lost serve only once in the past four rounds and dominated a dangerous Milos Raonic as he laid down a marker in the quarter-finals. Djokovic looks to be close to his best and a record-extending eighth title would make him to this slam what Federer is to Wimbledon. It looks as if Federer may need a third Melbourne miracle to beat his great rival in their 50th meeting but, until the last ball is hit, the man who has been down so many times this tournament cannot be entirely ruled out. The players will be on court at around: 7.30pm Melbourne time8.30am GMT.In the meantime: why not keep yourself entertained with memories of their Wimbledon tussle from last year. The 11-minute highlights are probably preferable to the full four hours and 57 minutes if you want to check back in time for today’s encounter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b5ce39d227d831c434210cdf35977916f8f876e/0_0_5124_3073/master/5124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e00d6b308231638bc427a46750c8d36","title":"tell us about the websites your children visit","story":"We want to hear from parents and young adults about the non-mainstream sites they and their children accessWith new rules for technology companies to protect children online announced by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, we want to hear about the non-mainstream sites children and young people access.Some of these principles include:We want to know about the surprising sites that children and young people visit.

What is the best advice to give them about specifications etc, bearing in mind their finite budgets?A user who wants a desktop PC to deal with email and social media, office files, surfing the web and streaming some video will also need to buy peripherals, including a monitor. Some will need a printer. Often the advice will be to get the best PC possible, but they may not get the full benefit if other parts of the system are too compromised. DavidAlmost every PC on the market will perform basic tasks such as writing emails and browsing the web. Even cheap laptops can run Microsoft Office and its rival suites, which are relatively lightweight by today’s standards. Most can also do simple photo and video editing, though rendering and other video processing tasks can take a very long time. The problem is not so much the type of task as the resources required by the software and the size of your files.Any PC should be able to handle a one-page letter and post messages on Facebook. Editing 500-page illustrated books or Excel spreadsheets with millions of cells is a different proposition.Either way, it’s better to have too much power than too little. It makes everyday computing more comfortable, and provides some future-proofing. Peripherals are peripheral, and replaceable.I don’t want to repeat last week’s description of the desktop’s advantages over laptops in terms of expandability, reparability and upgradeability, but someone on a finite budget can start with a cheap refurbished desktop and improve it as they go along. But this is only worthwhile if the CPU is fast enough to last a few years, when you can replace the PC and keep the peripherals.Short of replacing the motherboard, most desktop PCs are easy to upgrade, once you overcome the fear factor. Often there are YouTube videos to show you how it’s done.Second hand printers are even less attractive, unless they are proper business machines or laser printers. Consumer inkjets are cheap and disposable because the real money is made supplying ink cartridges.You may be able to source hardware cheaply, from refurbishers, or free. A worthy community group might be able to get a local newspaper to run their story, along with an appeal for unwanted hardware. You will probably have to collect it, and you may be offered quite a lot of junk. However, people can develop hardware skills on junk PCs, and extract parts to sell on eBay. If not, securely wiping hard drives and recycling old PCs is still a useful social function.Thanks to two long-term trends, most PC buyers can now afford a system that will run Microsoft Windows 10 reasonably well. First, as always, components have become cheaper and more powerful thanks to technological and manufacturing advances. Second, Microsoft has spent a decade making Windows more efficient. Today, Windows 10 usually runs on PCs that could run Vista well in 2006 or Windows 7 from 2009. Not many operating systems can claim that.But the fact that Windows 10 runs in 2GB of RAM does not make it a good idea. You get much better performance with 4GB, which (roughly) provides 2GB for Windows and 2GB for browser tabs.When a Windows 10 upgrade arrives, you need enough room for the download, the new version of the operating system and the previous version, all at the same time. The old version is stored in the Windows.old folder so that you can restore it if something goes wrong. PCs should update correctly if given extra space on a USB thumbdrive or an external hard drive. However, if you start with only 64GB, you may end up running the Disk Clean-up app (remember to click “Clean up system files”) and deleting stuff to make space for updates.Today, I think the minimum specification for Windows 10 or Linux Mint is 4GB of memory and a 120GB SSD, but everyone should aim for 8GB and a 240GB or larger SSD. Video editors, photographers, gamers and “power users” will want, and often need, more.Picking a processor is the trickiest part of buying a PC, because their relative merits are far from obvious. Real-world processor performance is influenced by the amount of memory, the type of storage and the cooling system, which includes the fans and the case. (In thin laptops, the CPU can be throttled to stop it from overheating, reducing performance in the process.)No one who sits down at an unknown PC can tell which CPU it’s using without looking it up. Often, differences don’t become evident until you have real work to do, or try to play a demanding game. If you just run Notepad, a slow system might look like fast one. If you try to reprocess an MP4 video, the fast one may take a few minutes and the slow one hours.Businesses can justify buying PCs that are fast enough to run their business processes because time is money. It’s worth doing a task just a few seconds faster if it’s repeated dozens or hundreds of times a day over many years. Home users usually don’t know how much time their PCs are wasting, and if they did, they probably wouldn’t care. If you’re only using a PC for a few hours a week, you won’t spend a fortune getting a browser to load five seconds faster.There’s also a subjective aspect: speed is what you are used to. For example, one of our seven-year-old Core i5 laptops seems a bit slow from the relative height of my six-core desktop, but some visitors have been impressed by its speed. They have a different concept of “normal”.So, from a psychological point of view, your clients should try to buy PCs that are as fast as the ones they are using now, or faster. Using what feels like a slow PC can be frustrating, whatever its real performance.The good news is that lots of old desktop processors still perform well by today’s standards. In response to the market’s move to ultra-thin laptops, Intel has been developing chips that use less power, generate less heat, need less cooling and provide longer battery life. Since 2005, it has focused on providing more performance per watt, rather than more raw performance. As a result, the Core i5-2500 that came out a decade ago is still faster than some new laptop chips because it runs at a TDP of 95W while they run at 15W or even 9W.There are hundreds of different processors in the refurbished PC market, but you can look up each chip’s score on the PassMark benchmark and compare it with your own PC’s score. Chips with significantly better scores should run faster. (Small percentage differences don’t matter.)For a Windows 10 PC that gets more-than-casual use, I think a PassMark score of around 2,500 is the minimum, and anything over 5,000 would probably be acceptable to most of your clients. Doubling that score would make it suitable for me, and doubling it again would satisfy a gamer.In general, you should be looking at Intel Core chips in the ex-corporate refurbished market, and Core i5 versions are often the best value. If you’re buying new, aim for the highest spec you can justify. Intel Core chips are still very good but the AMD Ryzen equivalents may be better value.Have you got a question?

Now advocates worry the men are on the brink of death.The men have applied for asylum in the US and are waiting for an immigration judge to rule on their cases.Advocates have filed an official complaint against Ice, condemning the organization for not providing the men with proper medical treatment during the strike. Two men have reportedly been force-fed – an act that multiple medical associations and human rights groups in the United States have said is inhumane and unethical.A second complaint was filed alleging Ice has not released the medical records of two of the men for independent review, a right that exists for those in Ice detention to ensure they are getting proper treatment.The men are all from south Asia and are seeking asylum in the US out of fear of religious persecution or retaliation for their political beliefs back home. Advocates say all five have friends and family in the United States who are waiting for them to be released.One of the men, Mehla, 22, who wished to go by a pseudonym for fear of repercussions if he was deported, told the  he fled to the US after he was pushed out of India for converting to Christianity. After he fled, members of the RSS, a rightwing Hindu nationalist party, came to his family’s home looking for him and threatened violence if he returned.After arriving in Germany with help from a family member, Mehla then went to Spain, where he took a flight to Mexico. He eventually crossed the Mexican border into the United States. Mehla was detained by Ice on 21 January last year, and has remained in detention since.“I applied for asylum. I am not a criminal. I never did any crime. I’ve never been to jail,” Mehla said in Hindi through a translator. “My demand is that they release me so I can fight my case outside detention.”Mehla is one of hundreds of thousands of migrants who have crossed the southern border in recent years to seek asylum. The US is obliged to allow migrants to go through the asylum application process if they fear persecution at home.Historically, those who apply for asylum in the US have been able to wait out the application process, which can take up to two years, outside detention if a judge approves a release on parole or bond.But legal advocates say migrants are being routinely denied parole or bond, meaning they are indefinitely held in Ice detention until their cases are heard before an immigration judge.“It’s just inhuman to keep these people for so many months in detention,” said Victoria Mesa-Estrada, senior staff attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has filed a lawsuit on behalf of migrants seeking parole.Mesa-Estrada said “immigration detention is a profitable business, especially in a state like Louisiana.” Ice turned eight state prisons and local jails in Louisiana into migrant detention facilities in 2019, though the number of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border started declining in the fall. The detention facilities, such as the one in Jena, tend to be in rural areas hours away from the urban centers.Multiple hunger strikes have occurred at Ice detention facilities in the deep south in the wake of the alleged mass denials of bond and parole.Mehla and the other men started their hunger strike on 1 November last year. Mehla said he weighed 161lb before the strike and now weighs 116lb. All five men – who range from early 20s to mid-30s – are in wheelchairs because they are too weak to walk.Advocates say two of the men have been force-fed, which requires a judge’s approval, via a tube that is inserted through the nostril and passed down to the stomach. The process is painful, especially if a person is resisting.Ice first revealed it was force-feeding migrants who went on hunger strike last January, when it confirmed at least six detainees were force-fed through nasal tubes. The migrants on hunger strike at that time were in Texas, Florida, Arizona and California.Michelle Iglesias, an Ice contract physician based in El Paso, Texas, testified in August at a hearing to allow two men from India to be force-fed that Ice regulations required force-feeding if it was necessary to prevent hunger strikes from starving themselves to death.“There wouldn’t be anyone in a hospital who would do it,” Iglesias said, according to Texas Monthly.Ice did not respond to requests for comment.Michelle Graffeo, a volunteer who visits two of the men every Sunday, said Ice keeps the feeding tube, which migrants call “the pipe”, in the body for as long as three weeks at a time.Graffeo said that for one of the men being force-fed, the process was much worse than the pain of hunger.Mehla has not been force-fed, but is worried that it may come to that point. “I’m scared of that, but I can’t do anything,” he said. “If they’re going to do a force-feeding, I can’t stop them.”Two of the men on hunger strike are now voluntarily drinking Boost nutritional supplement, though they refuse all other food, Graffeo said. One has been transferred to a facility in El Paso, while the last two men are being held in isolation, Graffeo learned last Sunday.Despite the potential health consequences and the pain of being on strike, Mehla said that he will continue his protest.n “The day I will start eating and drinking is the day I start being free,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ab0cb26f79d4c5f0531c55eb5130e3389de83fa/831_967_2321_1393/master/2321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=975441c35818e54e9e3b98bcff9dd214","title":"the highs and lows of britains 47 years in the eec and eu","story":"The key moments since the signing of the accession treaty in 1972The European parliament sets the seal on Britain’s departure from the EU on Friday by formally voting to ratify the withdrawal agreement paving the way for the UK to leave the bloc after 47 tumultuous years.A sad day for many, a moment for celebration for others.Here, we look back at some of the highs and lows of the UK’s membership.Friday will mark the start of what is likely to be an uphill battle to get a trade deal done by the end of the year, not to mention all the non-trade issues that must also be resolved including security and intelligence cooperation, fisheries, data, education and research collaboration.Although everyday life will remain the same and the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union until the end of the year as part of transition arrangements, the withdrawal agreement will be a legally binding international treaty that comes into force. It carries sanctions for any “backsliding or half measures”, as Michel Barnier’s adviser Stefaan de Rynck has pointed out.We know little of the plans for the negotiations, and parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit has been restricted. The House of Lords EU committee has invited but failed to get Stephen Barclay to appear to explain the next stages, sources say.While business has been clamouring for the government to reveal its Brexit vision beyond the joint aspiration of a tariff-free, quota-free deal, little is known about Boris Johnson’s specific goals.Expect plenty of sabre-rattling on both sides, but negotiations are unlikely to begin before March. The European commission kicked off its 30-stage process in agreeing its negotiating goals before Christmas and these are expected to be signed off by member states at a meeting on 25 February.David Frost, who replaced Oliver Robbins as the chief negotiator, is expected to lead a team of about 30 calling on expert knowledge from civil servants and trade experts. Some have suggested the government should hire as many as possible from the Canadian team that sealed Canada’s new deal with the EU.\u0026nbspThis remains the single most contentious part of the Brexit deal because of the checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. De Rynck said in January that the EU and the UK would have to be “very disciplined” if they were to get a new system for trading in Northern Ireland ready for 31 December.Brussels and Irish political leaders are already alarmed by Johnson’s repeated declarations that there will be no checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea, even though some of these will be mandatory.Helen McEntee, Ireland’s minister for European affairs has contradicted him directly, telling Sky News’s Sophy Ridge: “There will be no checks\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland businesses have urged the government to set up a working group urgently so that the detail of the checks can be determined quickly.Sir Edward Heath, the then prime minister, signs the accession treaty to the European Economic Community, which takes effect on 1 January 1973.“What dictators have failed to do by force, democracies are undertaking by peaceful consent … and the voice of European civilisation so muted since the second world war will be able to speak in a united way,” said the British commissioner, George Thomson.Margaret Thatcher urges the UK to vote yes to stay in Europe in referendum … before saying “no, no, no” to the European commission president Jacques Delors in 1990 over plans to extend Europe’s powers and competence into national political matters. The seeds of Euroscepticism had been sown years earlier when the iron lady marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand, as she had put it earlier, “our money back” from the European community.“Our interests are best served by not being a member of this club,” Farage says. “The level playing field is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit an iceberg.”The leader of Ukip was fined 10 days’ MEP allowances – about £2,700 – after refusing to apologise to the the Belgian president of the European parliament, Herman Van Rompuy. “I don’t want to be rude, but you have the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low grade bank clerk,” said Farage.MEP Seb Dance holds up placard that reads: “He’s lying to you,” behind Nigel Farage as the then Ukip leader defends Trump’s ban on Muslims entering the US.In what he thought could have been his last speech, two days before the original Brexit day, on 27 March, Alyn Smith apologised for some of his colleagues’ behaviour over the years, and said: “I’m not asking you to solve our domestic discussions. I am asking you to leave a light on so that we can find our way home.”Brexit party MEPs turn their backs as the European anthem, Ode to Joy, is played after being elected in a European election they thought would never happen.The classic BBC TV comedy Yes Minister had it right all along.Minister: “Surely you are committed to the European ideal?“Sir Humphrey: “Reaaaaaally minister, ha, ha, ha.

While several children were questioned, none were charged.Bidar police chief T Sreedhara said: “We have started an investigation into the complaint by an activist who alleged that the play criticised and disrespected Modi.”The charge of sedition, which is based on a British colonial era law, has increasingly been used against those protesting against the CAA in a bid to frame their actions as anti-nationalist. Last week, dozens of women in the state of Uttar Pradesh were charged with sedition for staging a peaceful sit-in against CAA.There are fears that in conjunction with plans to carry out a national register of citizens (NRC) across India, it will only be the country’s 200 million Muslims who will have to provide documentation to prove their Indian nationality or face the threat of detention or deportation. It has led to one of India’s biggest periods of unrest for over forty years, with millions taking to the streets every week in protest against the CAA and NRC."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97cc73ed3d56b7073ab21a8f5700ae0fb937075e/0_101_1152_691/master/1152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e087d8ffc4c30c5cc929d2e504166e0e","title":"indian state school has two teachers a cook and one pupil","story":"Shy seven-year-old girl is the only student after exodus to private schools in rural BiharEach day that seven-year-old Janhavi Kumari arrives at school, her red bag slung over her shoulder, she receives a celebrity welcome. It is not simply that this shy Dalit girl is the star pupil – she is also the only pupil.For the past year, this tiny rural school with pink walls, located in the village of Mansa Bigha, Gaya district, in the Indian state of Bihar, has remained open solely to provide Janhavi with the education she craved, providing her with two teachers and a cook who makes lunch most days.“I have learned to write my name in English and could even tell you the name of fruits and colours in English,” whispered a shy Janhavi, “but I have no friends to study, play and talk with.”Schoolteacher Priyanka Kumari said she was “very impressed” with the commitment of her sole pupil, who comes from an Indian caste who have long faced discrimination and historically had poor access to education. “Little Janhavi is very prompt,” she said. “She has never missed her class right since she got admission in our school in the last session. We also eagerly wait for her every day as her absence means no work for us to do all day.”The primary school, which has been running since 1972, was not always empty of pupils, but a recent growing mistrust about the standard of government schools led to an exodus of students to nearby private institutions. Despite the best efforts of the local administration to convince parents to keep their children in state schools, offering everything from bicycles, uniforms and shoes to schoolbags and free lunches, the government-run classrooms have continued to empty.However, coming from a poverty-stricken family from the lower Paswan caste (also known as Dusadh) for Janhavi, whose father works at a petrol pump and her mother is a housewife, the school fees were unaffordable and so this small local school was her only avenue for education. When Janhavi enrolled at the start of this year, the community made a decision that her education alone was worth the cost of keeping the school going.“How could we have closed down the school? It would have been denial of justice to the poor girl had we shut it down. She too has the right to study,” the local village council chief, Dharmraj Paswan, said.Janhavi’s mother, Pinki Kumari, said she was overjoyed that the school had kept functioning to teach only her daughter. “We are very happy,” she said. “We are so poor … we couldn’t pay hefty fees to private schools. If it wasn’t for the school’s support, my daughter would have been left illiterate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6ed4797bbcd8a44c518c29ac89f2837407e5a7c/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1791994db12df7d133f6a1316db6489","title":"thursday briefing auld lang syne on eve of exit","story":"Tearful scenes as MEPs ratify withdrawal agreement … chancellor poised to back HS2 … and what it looks like on the surface of the sunGood morning – Warren Murray here to straighten out a few things before the day gets started.The European parliament has ratified the withdrawal agreement with its Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, declaring: “It’s sad to see a country leaving that twice liberated us, twice gave its blood to liberate Europe.” Emotions ran high, with MEPs breaking into a rendition of Auld Lang Syne after the parliament’s president, David Sassoli, announced the result of the vote – 621 in favour, 49 against and 13 abstentions.

Video: Enda O\u0027Dowd \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJim Wilson: \u0027This isn’t what I signed up for: to be told by the British government to just ‘suck it up, and too bad this is the way it is going to be’.\u0027  Photograph: Enda O’Dowd In the distance over Jim Wilson’s shoulder stand the famous yellow Harland and Wolff shipyard cranes Samson\u0026nbspand Goliath, symbols on the landscape reflecting Belfast’s one-time economic might.Directly behind him is the only loyalist mural in Northern Ireland – in east Belfast – paired with another in the nearby nationalist Short Strand.Wilson, a former loyalist paramilitary in the Red Hand Commandos, is now a community worker committed to peace, and proud of the mural and the journey it represents.The murals depict two children, one Wilson’s grandson and the other the niece of a former Sinn Féin deputy lord mayor. The children are reaching out to shake hands in the murals, based on a poem called No More. The message is clear: the next generation wants no part in the violence of the past.This mural was unveiled 10 years ago, but the recent political ructions caused by Brexit in the North have stirred new concerns and tensions within the loyalist community, particularly among the younger generation.Loyalists oppose a trade border in the Irish Sea, the compromise agreed by British prime minister Boris Johnson and the EU in October that paves the way for the UK’s orderly departure from the EU on Friday.Loyalists see the new border in symbolic terms as eroding their political identity as unionists and British subjects of the crown.They see the new customs and regulatory frontier on the Irish Sea not as London, Dublin and Brussels see it – a compromise to avoid a hard Irish land Border that could have sparked republican anger and potentially violence – but as a step to Irish economic unity.For this they blame Johnson, who vowed at the DUP conference in 2018 not to create any economic barriers in the Irish Sea. Their anger is not helped by the confused messages from Johnson and UK officials about the checks required on goods moving between the North and Britain after Brexit.Days after Johnson said there would “emphatically” be no checks on trade across the Irish Sea, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, on a visit to Belfast on Monday, said checks on goods entering the North from Britain were “indispensable” consequences of the deal.‘Suck it up’Wilson says there is “a lot of anger” in the loyalist community that Johnson “totally betrayed” the British people of Northern Ireland.“This isn’t what I signed up for: to be told by the British government to just ‘suck it up, and too bad this is the way it is going to be’.”After the deal was unveiled in October a series of public meetings and rallies brought together a broad sweep of unionists and loyalists to protest against the deal they call the “betrayal act”.Wilson says Johnson’s deal was a “complete somersault”, and “the ultimate sell-out” which breaches the 1998 Belfast Agreement that underpins the peace process.“Economically he is tying us to the Irish Republic, which is in the EU. It might seem like it is the EU but that’s not the way the loyalist people look at it: they look at it as we are being tied to an economic united Ireland, which was not in the Good Friday agreement.”Wilson fears a repeat of the 2012-13 flag protests when loyalists protested over the limited number of days the union flag was flown over Belfast’s City Hall. He said the protests left hundreds of young Loyalists with criminal records that hurt their future prospects.“Those sort of things are not realistic anymore. I would hope that there are a few things up our sleeves that we could do, but I wouldn’t want to ulge it now. It is hard to explain how you feel when you have been betrayed by your own prime minister.”The former member of Red Hand Commando – a group affiliated with the Ulster Volunteer Force that was responsible for 500 murders in the Troubles – is clear there is “no appetite” to return to the violence of the past.However, Wilson is fearful of the impact of the “armchair generals” and “Facebook warriors” provoking the anger of younger loyalists via well-followed social media channels, some of which are saying “we will not be the generation to fail Northern Ireland”.“I couldn’t tell you where it’s going to go, to tell you the truth,” Wilson says.Criminal elementsEarlier, Wilson had shared his concerns on how Brexit might be used by some criminal elements within the loyalist community during a talk on post-conflict Northern Ireland with a group of US students hosted by Queen’s University.Some in the loyalist community would “saber-rattle”, he warned, speaking alongside Sinn Féin Belfast city councillor and republican Séanna Walsh, who famously read out the IRA statement announcing the end of its armed campaign.“This is not about their loyalism or their Britishness. This about giving them a reason to exist so that they can turn around and can continue to do their drug-dealing, their gangsterism, their money-lending.” These people would “love nothing better than a conflict to start up again because it will mask what they are doing”.He said “loyalism is not in a good place at the moment”.East of Belfast on Bangor’s loyalist Kilcooley estate – one of the biggest in the North – Alison Blayney, who runs the Kilcooley Women’s Centre (part-funded with EU money), says younger loyalists who are active on social media are “hopping mad” and feel “hugely betrayed” over the Brexit deal, which they see as “a one-way route to an economic united Ireland”.She does not believe there will be violence from the loyalist community in response to it: she feels people are “passed that stage” and “wise to the fact that it doesn’t achieve what it used to”.“They are moving towards thinking things through, thinking their politics through, but how they channel that I am not sure. It is a worrying time because I think they won’t accept it.”Blayney is hopeful that the EU and UK can tweak the Irish Sea border arrangements in this year’s trade talks, but she warns against the “dangerous words” being used on the checks.“It’s dangerous terminology because no one really understands what is going to happen because there are different messages coming out.”DivisionsAt Ledley Hall Boys and Girls Club in east Belfast, young loyalists are worried that Sinn Féin is trying to take advantage of the isions over Brexit in the North to push for a Border poll on Irish unity. The party has pledged to secure a poll within five years as one of its manifesto promises south of the Border in the run-up to the February 8th general election.This, as loyalists see it, will inevitably cause tensions between the North’s two communities. “Sinn Féin’s election posters will be ‘we got the sea border, next we are going for the Border poll.’ We will be reminded of it every day,” said one of the youth club’s workers, who only wanted to be identified as ‘KC’.“Anything that we take as a win they take as a loss, so if they are taking it as a win we will be wary of it.”Nationalists will, he says, see the Irish Sea border as a “financial united Ireland” and “the first step to a united Ireland” – a prospect that loyalists abhor.“The words ‘united Ireland’ to a unionist or a loyalist is just petrifying because you have been told by your granny growing up, ‘it is never going to happen, not in your lifetime’, and now it possibly could,” he said.Wayne Gilmour (25), a self-declared loyalist activist from a working-class background who was a regular demonstrator in the flags protests, sees the Brexit deal as in effect giving Northern Ireland as “a delayed gift to the South”.He said it has created “great mistrust”, and fed “the paranoia and siege mentality” among loyalists-unionists.“I know people that would never have been political, wouldn’t have been openly hardline about anything, and they are falling into the fringes,” he said, sitting in a community office in the loyalist Tiger’s Bay area of north Belfast.Loyalists are angered by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s failure to take account of their community’s views or worries during the Brexit process. Gilmour was incensed by Varadkar’s comments in October that people in the North would still be able to post letters in red postboxes after the Brexit deal.Arrogance“Who does he think he is? The arrogance is unbelievable. He is the representative of a foreign state he shouldn’t have any say in the affairs of our state at all.”Although Gilmour is not suggesting violence as a means to oppose the deal, he said he could understand why it is seen as a possibility given that the compromise deal came about in response to the “threat of violence from Irish republicanism” over a potential hard land Border.“It would be foolhardy and naive of the British government to mistake or think that loyalism will be quietly pushed into a corner, and will be pacified and accept the deal as it is,” he said, anticipating “mass protests” from the likes of the Orange Order and other bodies opposed to it.Gilmour says Loyalists are “stuck between a rock and a hard place at the moment”, and that “any deal that dilutes the sovereignty of Northern Ireland will be resisted”.He says he is too young to have experienced the height of the Troubles, but is fearful of a possible return to violence.“I fear the night when you hear the rumble and you know what’s happened. It is that sinking feeling. It is just shared among the loyalist community at the moment there’s a feeling of despair that it is going backwards and we can’t stop it.”He says violence is horrible and wrong, but he warns of a “strange duality” within loyalism.“If it does fall backwards you are going to have to do what you can to protect your people’s birthright. If the state can’t do it, you do it.“That in-built sense, that I know it’s not normal to have, but that lies in the back of your head: what if? What are you prepared to do? And no one should be asking themselves that, but we feel that neglected and pushed.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireLeo Varadkar probably thought the biggest threat to a successful day out in Wexford on Wednesday lay outside the Fine Gael camp. The Taoiseach would have been fully aware of the ongoing threat posed by the Veronavirus and his team would have taken all necessary precautions to protect him from it. As it turned out, he never came in contact with Verona Murphy, the party’s much vaunted candidate in the Wexford byelection last year before she ran her mouth off about immigrants and was duly booted off the general election ticket.They don’t like to talk about her now.But the head of the Road Haulage Association hasn’t gone quietly and is running a very strong campaign in the county as an independent. Where once her face adorned posters in Fine Gael blue, she now looks out defiantly from a dark background of burnt orange – or black and tan as the locals are describing it. Apart from her remarks about migrant toddlers in Wexford becoming Islamic State recruits, her posters themselves are an abomination – a grammatical one. However, it was the presence of his own contingent of candidates, lusting after a bit of notice, which posed most risk to Leo – physical rather than political. He stepped from his car in New Ross and before he had time to stand up straight a trio of flying Fine Gael candidates burst from nowhere and hurled themselves at him. But these were no ordinary candidates. These were junior ministerial candidates. There is nothing so ruthless or needy as ambitious junior ministers hell-bent on political advancement. They have tasted a little of power and they crave more. Ministerial velcroPaul Kehoe, Michael D’arcy and John Paul Phelan were the three Fine Gael Ministers of State determined to Velcro themselves to Leo Varadkar during all his photo opportunities at the official opening of the New Ross bypass and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy bridge. Kehoe and D’arcy, on the Wexford side of the magnificent new structure, are fighting it out for the guaranteed Fine Gael seat in the constituency. A second one is looking increasingly like a tall order this time out. Phelan, meanwhile, would be on firmer ground in Carlow-Kilkenny, with colleague Carlow-based Pat Deering snapping at his heels. But every bit of publicity helps. All three were on a mission to milk this good news occasion by getting their mugs in as many photos with photogenic Leo as possible. With perseverance and luck, they might even bag a fleeting appearance on the television news. Alongside them, the Lord Mayor of Wexford, despite being a Fianna Fáil man, shamelessly elbowed himself into the frame whenever he could using his chain of office as a shield. Michael Sheehan is not expected to displace his party colleague and the constituency’s newest TD, Malcolm Byrne, winner of the Wexford bye-election in November, but it won’t be for the want of putting himself about. Byrne decided to stand back from the fray. “It’s a day for the engineers and builders” he said.Pride of Labour PartyAs Leo was engulfed in the rolling maul of his own ministers and one mayor, Labour leader and constituency elder statesman Brendan Howlin swooped in under them all, calmly greeted the Taoiseach and took it upon himself to escort him from his car. Brendan has a proprietorial interest in the new bypass. “I turned the sod on it when I was minister for public expenditure,” he said with pride. Howlin gave the green light to release almost €1 billion in 2012 for significant transport projects, including the New Ross bypass and bridge. And the happy minister for transport also claiming credit at the time was one Leo Varadkar. Graciously, Leo acknowledged his Labour colleague’s part in delivering the infrastructure during his speech. Also claiming credit on large posters in Wexford are the Ministers of State Kehoe and D’arcy: “Shortening your Journey. Delivering for Wexford.” You’d nearly think they built the road themselves. The large platform built on the pristine stretch of roadway with the impressive s of the bridge gleaming in the distance was groaning with public representatives for the formalities. Thankfully, a space was found for engineer (and local woman) Mary Bowe, the project manager.“This is the biggest platform party I’ve seen in a long time at one of these events,” marvelled a public servant. Why could that be? Something to do with the election? TDs from Wexford and Kilkenny took the bare look off the stage. Fianna Fáil’s James Brown and Bobby Aylward didn’t miss the the occasion. There were 21 men on the platform and 3 women (engineer par excellence, Mary Bowe the CEO of Kilkenny County Council and Rose Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, great grand-daughter of the Kennedy matriarch and JFK’s mother, Rose, in whose honour the bridge is named.)Vacant seatsThere were a couple of vacant seats. But Verona Murphy’s name wasn’t on one of them. She was there, at the edge of the crowd, standing near the large foundation stone waiting to be unveiled later by the man who invited her into Fine Gael and then booted her out. (Only herself to blame.)The photographers were hopeful. Windy junior ministers clustered around the Taoiseach aren’t the best material. So they kept an eye on Verona. “Will she approach him, do you think?” one of them asked a colleague. “I hope she f****** does,” came the reply.The speeches went on for a long, long time. There were three chains of office on the platform and more in the invited crowd. The Taoiseach was last to speak. He promised to be brief, recognising it was bitterly cold. At ten minutes, he nearly delivered on the promise. “By the power invested in me, none of you have homework tonight,” he declared, warming the cockles of the 100 hypothermic schoolchildren along to witness this great event. Contractors BAM, the contractors building the National Children’s Hospital, gave them all goodie bags – the children, not the politicians. They contained pens and sweeties. There was an ecumenical prayer service. The Church of Ireland representative cut an imposing figure, a very tall man, dressed for the weather with a voluminous black cape and a black broad brimmed hat. Some people thought he was Phil Hogan. A few Fianna Fáilers were calling the new road the “Howlin Highway”, just to annoy the Fine Gaelers. CountdownAfter the speeches, the Taoiseach went to the other side of the road to unveil the commemorative stone. Verona hovered, but was swallowed up in the crowd. The Taoiseach didn’t see her. Then he went further along the road, with the bridge to his back for the photos, and did the official cutting of the tape with Rose Kennedy Townsend. Leo was wearing very shiny black leather gloves. He held his side of the tape very tightly, wielding a gold pair of scissors and braced, feet apart and firmly planted, like he was preparing to cut the umbilical cord of an alien baby. Or cut all ties with Catherine Noone. He called for a countdown. There was silence. The junior ministers were so excited they couldn’t speak. So he had to do it himself. “5 . . . 4 . . .” Off to one side, Verona Murphy was working the crowd. Earlier, while the Taoiseach made his speech, she stood with her back to him, talking away to a companion. She made sure to avoid him after the formalities, yet was always nearby. He moved, she moved. Always within distance but never close enough for any form of contact. The photographers were beside themselves. But they were to be disappointed. When Leo left, the junior ministers melted away. “I tell you one thing,” mused an official as they departed. “If the Irish team performs half as well in the scrum as that lot performed today, we’ll win hands down against Scotland on Saturday.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4155422.1580333652!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"public transport in meath is broken there is no work life balance","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTraffic on the M3 motorway which links Dublin and Navan, Co Meath. File photograph: Alan BetsonPolitical promises come and go but patience when it comes to a long-standing pledge to deliver a train line linking Dublin and Navan, Co Meath, is wearing thin due to residents facing long travel times when commuting by car or bus.Locals say the traffic problem is getting worse as a result of growth in the commuter belt’s population, with buses often full before reaching stops along the route.This has seen the need for a rail line, and a solution to the problem of workers being stuck in cars and on buses for hours every day, emerge as an election issue in the Meath constituencies.“The old catchphrase of Navan being ‘only an hour from Dublin’ certainly doesn’t hold true any more for the commuters, many of whom could be home to their kids in a lot less time in the evenings if there was a train,” says Sinead Walker Nelson (49), who leaves her home in Navan before 5.45am to reach her job at AIB in Ballsbridge on time.Hefty costs“I work remotely two days a week and drive to work the other three as buses would not get me in on time. I leave early to beat the traffic and mornings aren’t too bad, taking about 1½ hours but the evenings are a nightmare.“I’ve tried every route and they are all the same. I leave work and am in the car by 4pm, so technically ahead of rush hour traffic. It still takes me 2½ hours to drive 62km. Regularly it takes me an hour to travel just 12km.”She says the costs are hefty too, with tolls coming to €120 a month and petrol a further €300.To help put these quality of life and infrastructure issues on the agenda ahead of next month’s general election, a public meeting entitled “Meath on Track” is taking place in in the Newgrange Hotel, Navan on Thursday, with Meath West Aontú TD Peadar Tóibín chairing.Rail services ran between Dublin and Navan until the 1960s, when the line was closed as part of a major rationalisation of the State’s railway network.The restoration of the line has been mooted many times since, often around election times, and in 2005 it was announced the line to Navan would be rebuilt in two phases as a branch of the western commuter line.Since September 2010, train services have operated from Dublin’s docklands to the M3 Parkway station near Clonee. An additional 21-mile stretch to Navan was to open by 2015 under the then government’s Transport 21 programme.After the recession hit, plans for the extension were omitted from national infrastructure plans. It was not included in the Government’s Project Ireland 2040 strategy last year and it was reported last summer that Minister for Planning Eoghan Murphy had issued a draft directive to the Eastern and Midlands Regional Authority to downgrade the status of the proposed rail line.Jammed busesEarlier this month, Minister of State and Meath West TD Damien English said the National Transport Authority and Department of Transport were to complete a feasibility study this year on the rail line and that once viability had been proven, the next phase would be the allocation of funding.For people like Andrew Ralph (23), who lives between Dunshaughlin and Ratoath, a rail option cannot come soon enough.He says commuting is the “single biggest issue” in and around Ratoath where he estimates that 70 per cent of people commute to work.“At the minute the biggest problem in Ratoath is that there are no direct buses to Dublin from a village of 11,500 people,” he says.Ralph estimates that he spends an average of 13 hours commuting per week commuting from the town, which is 25km from Dublin city centre.“At the minute, the buses are jammed. The commute is stressful and there is no work-life balance. Public transport in Meath is broken,” he says.In Johnstown, a village outside Navan, commuters report being left on the side of the road regularly by passing buses as they are full to capacity.“When a bus finally stops, there’s a seat lottery. Queues of people push and shove to get on the bus and get a seat,” says Clodagh Roche (45).She says it can take 5½ hours to get to and from college in Blanchardstown and that this means “our quality of life has been diminished”.“We are the people who get up early in the mornings – to try and catch a bus against the odds,” she said.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Politics latest news: Boris Johnson looks set for revolt over HS2 as backbenchers vow to defy whip if it goes ahead How will the Brexit transition period work?Brexit deal: what does it mean for you?Brexit day: what happens after January 31?Coronavirus infection: everything you need to know about the outbreak from China Alastair Stewart steps down from ITV News amid race row over Shakespeare tweetPlanned flight to evacuate Britons from coronavirus hit Wuhan delayed as experts mull declaring global health emergencyMotorbike gunmen kill two polio workers in PakistanComment: The stubborn and remote BBC is heading for self-destructionKobe Bryant\u0026#39s wife Vanessa speaks of her devastation after helicopter crashCoronavirus: Britons brought back from Wuhan could be quarantined in military baseRachmaninoff the most innovative composer ever...says computerBritain to stop exporting its plastic waste to developing countries under new environment legislation Homeowners should be asked how many neighbours they know to measure happiness, official review saysUnconditional offers with strings attached will reduce by up to 75 per cent in a year, Ucas saysNumber of children treated for eating disorders on NHS has increased by 50 per cent in two years, report revealsEnergy networks reap rewards as customers foot £800m bill, says Government We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus inside locked chinese city virus deja vu","story":"These days, getting fresh food in Foshan for Li Xiyan means waking early and having sharp elbows to fend off other people. Shops are struggling to replenish stocks after authorities blocked numerous transport links across China in efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak.“The supermarkets don’t have much,” said Ms Li, 55, who lines up before the doors open at 8am. “It’s OK, we just eat less.But simple meals at home are a far cry from how she normally spends this time of year, celebrating the Lunar New Year holiday at banquets with family and friends.  In Foshan, in south-eastern Guangdong province, local officials have cancelled public events and shuttered tourist attractions – including a theme park honouring homegrown kung-fu icon Bruce Lee. Few cars travel the roads, shops are closed and empty public buses criss-cross the city, which is known for its textile manufacturing.  Many have obeyed the government’s recommendation to stay at home to try to reduce exposure to the new virus, which has infected nearly 7,711 and killed more than 170.Guangdong has confirmed more than 200 cases, making it the second hardest-hit after Hubei province, which is home to Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. Wuhan is on lockdown as experts race to work out the cause of the virus, and how to stop it, and British nationals have been evacuated.For many in Foshan, this is old news – this city is where scientists believe the first Sars case developed, a coronavirus epidemic that originated in China, spread abroad, and killed nearly 800 people in 2002 and 2003.  “It’s not that scary,” Ms Li says. “We’ve been through this before.”  In a mall in Foshan, hand soap is almost sold out as residents try to protect themselves Members of the public have their body temperature screened as they enter the mall As of midnight Tuesday, the number of cases exceeded the 5,327 people infected by Sars nearly two decades ago.  The figures have been ticking rapidly upward in the four weeks since China announced it was investigating a new mystery disease, though the country\u0027s centre for disease control estimates a mortality rate of less than 3 per cent, lower than the 10 per cent that were affected by Sars.The government is providing more frequent updates now than it did in 2002, when officials actively suppressed news of the Sars outbreak, exacerbating disease spread and creating panic and confusion among residents. Still, there is growing evidence that the official numbers released may not paint the full picture just yet.The  interviewed Kyle Hui, 42, whose stepmother Chen Min, 65, died within 10 days of developing a fever and cough – symptoms consistent with the new coronavirus infection.  But doctors never tested her for the disease, and her death wasn’t included in the official government count, suggesting the scale of the problem remains far greater than Chinese authorities have acknowledged.  Updates are even harder to come by for doctors working in hospitals designated for treating coronavirus patients, including at the Foshan No. 1 People’s Hospital, where two workers in hazmat suits, blue latex gloves and face masks, pictured below, checked the temperature of everyone entering the building, as seen below.At Foshan\u0026#39s No. 1 People’s Hospital, workers in hazmat suits, blue latex gloves and face masks take the temperature of everyone entering the building The infectious diseases ward had its doors propped open, and a sole doctor’s coat hung outside the canteen, as teams of police patrolled the ground. One officer shooed the  away.Information about new developments, including the number of admitted patients infected with the new coronavirus, is hard to come by at the hospital.“There’s no internal communication – we aren’t told much,” said Mr Yang, a doctor at the hospital, who declined to give his full name as he wasn’t authorised to speak to media.Instead, details are being reported to senior health authorities, before being passed on and disseminated through China’s state-controlled media outlets, from where he and the rest of the country’s 1.4 billion citizens are getting their information.“The situation is very serious,” he said. “Now we know it’s contagious and the risks are very high.”“It’s tiring work, being a doctor – it’s hard and dangerous,” he said. “But this is the way things are right now in the country hopefully, it will get better.”  Locals, though, find the state media updates reassuring. Zhang Yonghang, 30, an English teacher, follows them daily, and remains unfussed, even though China has now raised the highest public health alert.“I don’t think it’s as bad as back then,” Ms Zhang said, referring to the Sars epidemic, when she remembers being worried. “This time, It seems like the government is more nervous, because of all the Lunar New Year travel.”“Staying at home, we’ve been quite bored,” she said, while taking a stroll with her husband and three-year-old daughter in a park next to the Foshan hospital. Long days of doing little will continue for the next few weeks as her school has delayed the start of classes until mid-February.Not everyone is so relaxed. Delivery man Mr Fei, 23, pictured below, in neighbouring Guangzhou, a city of 15 million and the capital of Guangdong province, slips on gloves for protection when he send takeaway deliveries to hospitals.“Of course I’m worried when I have to fulfill those,” he said. “But if I feel that way, others will, too, which means if I push it off, they might as well.”“So I think I better just do it – at this time, it’s better to be strong and help out.”Mr Fei, a delivery man in GuangzhouWith the disease outbreak, fewer orders are coming in, and he expects to take home half of his usual wages – at most 3,000 yuan (£330) this month. So he’s now looking for temporary jobs to make up the difference.Mr Fei, like anyone who ventures outside, is now required to don a face mask. People are also frequently stopped at mall entrances, toll booths, makeshift roadside stands, even parking garage entrances to have their body temperatures checked.  Workers are screening for a fever, an indicator of a potential coronavirus infection, though it’s unclear how effective this will be in combating further spread as scientists have found it’s possible to be infected and not display any symptoms.Experts are racing to understand the novel coronavirus, investigating how the virus jumped between humans and figuring out in what ways people become infected – all important clues that could inform disease prevention and treatment.  This week it emerged that scientists have successfully grown a version of the Wuhan coronavirus, seen in the video below, which could pave the way for the development of a vaccine against the deadly illness.“Now we know there are second, or third-generation cases that have come from those first cases,” said David Heymann, an infectious disease expert at Chatham House, who led the global response to Sars as the executive director of the World Health Organization’s communicable diseases cluster.  “The question we have is, how is it transmitted?” he said. “Is it just by close bodily contact, is it face-to-face when someone coughs in another person’s face?”Until experts discover more about the new virus, allowing health officials to get a better handle on the situation, many Chinese will continue lining up for fever checks and disinfectant spritzes – a handy solution as shops are all out of anti-bacterial hand gels, soaps, wet wipes and cleaning liquids.Cleaners will also keep disinfecting hotel lobbies, shopping centres, and elevators, with signs everywhere showing the sanitising schedule.It’s hard to think about much else with public health announcements emblazoned on billboards – “Have you washed your hands today? Did you remember a face mask today?” – along with propaganda slogans about “government control” over the epidemic.In rural villages, they’re even broadcast on loop over loudspeakers.  Still, Ms Li says life keeps on churning for her and her daughter, Li Sha, 28. The main difference is that they’ve hoarded face masks and always carry a bit of disinfectant hand gel with them.  But “the vegetables are a little bit more expensive,” complained Ms Li. Politics latest news: Boris Johnson looks set for revolt over HS2 as backbenchers vow to defy whip if it goes ahead How will the Brexit transition period work?Brexit deal: what does it mean for you?Brexit day: what happens after January 31?Coronavirus infection: everything you need to know about the outbreak from China Alastair Stewart steps down from ITV News amid race row over Shakespeare tweetPlanned flight to evacuate Britons from coronavirus hit Wuhan delayed as experts mull declaring global health emergencyMotorbike gunmen kill two polio workers in PakistanComment: The stubborn and remote BBC is heading for self-destructionKobe Bryant\u0026#39s wife Vanessa speaks of her devastation after helicopter crashCoronavirus: Britons brought back from Wuhan could be quarantined in military baseRachmaninoff the most innovative composer ever...says computerBritain to stop exporting its plastic waste to developing countries under new environment legislation Homeowners should be asked how many neighbours they know to measure happiness, official review saysUnconditional offers with strings attached will reduce by up to 75 per cent in a year, Ucas saysNumber of children treated for eating disorders on NHS has increased by 50 per cent in two years, report revealsEnergy networks reap rewards as customers foot £800m bill, says Government We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/30/TELEMMGLPICT000220036745_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq900leoZVuq6ru6F43OqP_jlaTMTxUhlzF8Rkw038U-A.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"radio 4s today programme editor sarah sands resigns amid bbc","story":"Editor of BBC Radio 4\u0026#39s Today programme Sarah SandsBBC Radio 4 Today programme editor Sarah Sands has submitted her resignation, it has emerged hours after the broadcaster announced 450 job cuts.Sands confirmed her departure on Twitter, saying: I have decided to move on from being Editor of the Today programme and propose to leave the BBC in September.It has been a privilege to be part of this remarkable team and I am proud to have championed our intelligent journalism and political independence.

Why is it that American citizens and Australian citizens are being airlifted out and Britain hasn’t yet been able to do that? Are we reacting in the right way?These are entirely reasonable questions which I think ministers.. It’s the task of ministers to make those decisions but then to explain them to the public. Democracy is a conversation and ministers of course need to look at the evidence but then explain through the media to voters, to citizens, why it is they’re taking the decisions they are.Meanwhile the World Health Organisation (WHO) said its Emergency Committee would reconvene behind closed doors on Thursday to decide whether the rapid spread of the new virus from China now constitutes a global emergency.Dr Michael Ryan, executive director at the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, said the decision to reconvene was due to the increasing number of cases and evidence of person-to-person transmission of the virus.He said: The whole world needs to be on alert now, the whole world needs to take action and be ready for any cases that come, either from the original epicentre or from other epicentres that become established.China\u0027s National Health Commission said the total number of confirmed deaths from the deadly new coronavirus in the country climbed to 170, with more than 7,800 infected globally. Coronavirus symptoms | How to prevent infection and keep safeCoronavirus symptoms | How to prevent infection and keep safeAlmost all the deaths so far have been in the central province of Hubei, home to about 60 million people and now under virtual lockdown. The virus emerged last month and spread from bats to humans via a single animal sold at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, the first genetic analysis of the virus has shown.Infections have been reported in at least 15 other nations, with 104 confirmed cases.Airlines around the world announced they were cutting flights to China, and Hong Kong was suspending rail travel to and from the mainland at midnight.Countries including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and the United States are working to evacuate citizens from Wuhan or have already started.Three Japanese who returned on the first flight on Wednesday were confirmed to be infected with the virus, said the health ministry, two of the three had not shown any symptoms.A second flight with Japanese evacuees from Wuhan landed in Japan on Thursday with nine people showing symptoms of fever or coughing, broadcaster NHK reported.Residents stage a rally to protest the government\u0026#39s decision to quarantine South Koreans returning from Wuhan in their home town in JincheonNearly 200 Americans, mostly US diplomats and their families, airlifted from Wuhan on Wednesday will remain isolated at a US military base in California for at least 72 hours of medical evaluation, public health officials said.South Korean protesters used tractors to block access to facilities earmarked as quarantine centres in the cities of Asan and Jincheon, about 50 miles south of Seoul, on Wednesday.South Korean President Moon Jae-in urged residents not to give in to fear as the country prepared to evacuate the first of around 700 citizens from Wuhan.The weapons that will protect us from the new coronavirus are not fear and aversion but trust and cooperation, Mr Moon said in a speech on Thursday, decrying fake news as creating excessive anxiety.Britons returning from Wuhan will be put in quarantine for 14 days and officials are looking at taking passengers to a military base once they arrive home, the Department of Health said.A Downing Street source said it was expecting about 200 British nationals to be returned from Wuhan and they had agreed to be placed in assisted isolation.Passengers will only be allowed to travel if they sign a contract agreeing to stay in the quarantine throughout the period. Ambulances arrive at Haneda airport in Tokyo after the arrival of the second charter flight from the Chinese city of WuhanMatt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said: We are working hard to get British nationals back from Wuhan. Public safety is the top priority. Anyone who returns from Wuhan will be safely isolated for 14 days, with all necessary medical attention.It came after the Foreign Office updated its advice on Tuesday to warn against all but essential travel to mainland China, saying it may become more difficult for British nationals in other provinces to leave.On Wednesday, British Airways announced it was suspending all flights to and from mainland China with immediate effect, but Virgin Atlantic said its flights between Heathrow and Shanghai will continue to operate as scheduled.The effects of the virus are already weighing heavily on China\u0027s economy, the world\u0027s second-biggest, with companies cutting corporate travel and tourists cancelling trips during the traditional Lunar New Year holiday period.A government economist said the crisis could cut China\u0027s first-quarter growth by one point to 5 per cent or lower as the crisis hits sectors from mining to luxury goods.A vendor of traditional masks wears a facial mask at his shop in ThamelVarious airlines are cutting flights to the country, from British Airways and Lufthansa to Air Canada and American Airlines.Alphabet Inc\u0027s Google said it would temporarily shut all its offices in China and Sweden\u0027s IKEA said it had temporarily closed all its stores in the country because of the outbreak.Meanwhile the World Athletics Indoor Championships in Nanjing, China, have been postponed until March 2021, World Athletics has announced.In many Chinese cities, streets were largely deserted. Tourist attractions were closed, while Starbucks coffee shops required people to have their temperatures taken and to wear masks.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

My mission to make our house more sustainable starts with thinking about making it warmer this week, I’ve been mostly thinking about thermostats.Given my day job is technology editor here at The Independent, it’s the technological solutions that seem most immediate. And starting with the thermostat seems an obvious one, given how much money and emissions are wasted on central heating.We recently got a smart thermostat, after struggling with a decidedly un-smart timer on our boiler. There was of course nothing green about that, given that it spent much of the time coming on when we weren’t even in. And there was plenty that wasn’t comfortable about it, either, since it would often be on when the house was too hot, or not in as we shivered in the cold. (In the end we gave up and mostly turned it off and on manually.)Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe have the Nest Thermostat E. (Nest, which is now owned by Google, are probably the most famous of the smart home companies, and the thermostat is probably their most famous product the E supposedly stands for a variety of things including “easy” and “energy-saving”, but basically means that it’s the cheaper version.) It works by getting your location and learning how you tend to like your heating, setting up a smart schedule and turning the heating off when you’re not there.So since the beginning of the year I’ve been thinking about how best we can optimise the amount of energy that thermostat uses. Though it is smart, it still works on what you tell it as such, you can change what sort of temperature you want it to be.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

So the main thing I’ve done is turn the heating down before we get into bed, ensuring that we aren’t wasting heat that will only be around once we’ve gone to bed. (Another of my personal pledges for 2020 is to ensure that I pay full attention to my sleep, after reading Matthew Walker’s luminous book on the subject, and this helps with that too.)Why I\u0027m making my home more eco-friendlyThe Nest gives you a leaf when you’re being energy-\u0026nbspand eco-conscious by having the temperature lower than it might expect. And I feel generally rewarded, too: while there’s no real way to know the impact this is having on our own gas usage, it feels like we almost certainly are saving energy.Smart thermostats – or, if you are like me and didn’t have a non-smart one before, any kind of thermostat – feel like a wonderful symbol of how easy it can be to be more efficient. As it turns out, we aren’t much colder our house is still heated when we need it. It’s just that it won’t be heated when we’re not there, or when we’re already warm enough. Saving money and emissions on heating has actually made life easier.Getting one is expensive, of course: the Nest Thermostat E is £199, and you’ll have to pay for installation if you live in a confusing, complicated house like ours. But most people probably won’t need to, and there are plenty of deals and discount schemes from energy companies that should make it a little more easy to swallow.I suspect, as we head through the year of making our house more sustainable, that not all the changes we make will be quite so seamless, comfortable or sacrifice free. But I certainly hope so, because this feels like the kind of change that is incredibly nice to make, not only helping save the world in the tiniest way, but also saving money, and saving us from being cold.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Factories outside Wuhan area will not reopen after the lunar new year holiday until 10 February, Mr Cook said, but Apple built the delayed restart into its wider revenue forecast.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Those currently paying a lot in daily fees are likely to see their borrowing costs reduced while those who are less heavily into their overdrafts will pay more.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Torches are lit using a flare ahead of the Up Helly Aa Viking festival.

It has previously warned that it would look at introducing a cap on overdraft charges if lenders did not introduce competitive rates.HSBC, First Direct, M\u0026ampS Bank and TSB will all introduce rates of 39.9 per cent while NatWest is to charge half a percentage point less. Nationwide has already brought in a 39.9 per cent rate for its current accounts and Barclays will charge 35 per cent.Lloyds Banking Group has said its customers will be charged new “personalised” overdraft rates of up to 49.9 per cent from April.In a letter to lenders, the FCA wrote: “We are writing to you to understand more about your new overdraft pricing and the measures you have in place to help customers who may be adversely impacted by the changes you are making to this pricing.”The watchdog introduced changes to overdraft rules after it found that unarranged overdraft fees can be 10 times as high as charges for payday loans.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The latest version of Apple’s wireless earbuds\u0026nbspAirPods sold well during the festive season.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShares in the company rose 1 per cent after the announcement.

Factories outside Wuhan area will not reopen after the lunar new year holiday until 10 February, Mr Cook said, but Apple built the delayed restart into its wider revenue forecast.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Those currently paying a lot in daily fees are likely to see their borrowing costs reduced while those who are less heavily into their overdrafts will pay more.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Torches are lit using a flare ahead of the Up Helly Aa Viking festival.

Britain will go to the polls tomorrow to voteA surfer off the North East coast at TynemouthThe FCA said on Tuesday that it has asked banks how they decided on their new rates, which have clustered around 40 per cent. It has previously warned that it would look at introducing a cap on overdraft charges if lenders did not introduce competitive rates.HSBC, First Direct, M\u0026ampS Bank and TSB will all introduce rates of 39.9 per cent while NatWest is to charge half a percentage point less. Nationwide has already brought in a 39.9 per cent rate for its current accounts and Barclays will charge 35 per cent.Lloyds Banking Group has said its customers will be charged new “personalised” overdraft rates of up to 49.9 per cent from April.In a letter to lenders, the FCA wrote: “We are writing to you to understand more about your new overdraft pricing and the measures you have in place to help customers who may be adversely impacted by the changes you are making to this pricing.”The watchdog introduced changes to overdraft rules after it found that unarranged overdraft fees can be 10 times as high as charges for payday loans.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ms Melis suggested that deregulation after Brexit could help persuade financial services businesses to remain in the UK.“If the government can position the UK as having a more favourable regulatory environment and separate it from the red tape of European regulation, then we may see the UK win back its crown and attract new talent to the sector,” Melis said.Adopting a light-touch approach to regulation after Brexit – dubbed the “Singapore-on-Thames” model by some critics – would likely prove controversial.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The world is watching to see if the UK and the EU can overcome the political hurdles around Brexit and secure a deal that makes economic sense.\u0026nbsp“With European economies facing significant economic headwinds, it is vital that policymakers keep a sharp weather eye on wider European competitiveness, and seek to maintain open and unfettered access to global capital markets through Europe’s primary international financial centre in the UK.”Separate research conducted by ZYen found that New York overtook London as the world’s top banking hub in September 2018 and extended its lead last year.Despite the increasingly bleak sentiment about London’s future, its financial sector is still expanding at a healthy clip, at least on some measures.The UK’s net exports of financial and related professional services grew by around 5 per cent to an estimated £82.8bn in 2018, up from £79bn in 2017.\u0026nbspIn currency markets, London has consolidated its dominant position, accounting for 43 per cent of global foreign exchange revenues last year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We know students who accept unconditional offers are more likely to miss their predicted A-levels.”“I welcome those institutions leading the way in committing to end these offers, but there is clearly more to do,” he added.\u0026nbspNicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students (OfS), said: “These offers actually come with strings attached, and risk placing undue pressure on students. Any such pressure is both unacceptable and unfair.\u0026nbsp“Universities’ admissions policies should always be designed with the student, and not the institution, in mind.”A Universities UK\u0026nbspspokesperson said: “While there are clear benefits in universities being able to use a variety of offer-making practices to reflect an inidual student’s circumstances, potential and the context of their application, it is important all are used appropriately, proportionately and in the best interests of students.“As part of our Fair Admissions review we are working with students, school, college, university and Ucas leaders to strengthen higher education admissions in the interest of fairness, transparency and in encouraging aspiration.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Ms Melis suggested that deregulation after Brexit could help persuade financial services businesses to remain in the UK.“If the government can position the UK as having a more favourable regulatory environment and separate it from the red tape of European regulation, then we may see the UK win back its crown and attract new talent to the sector,” Melis said.Adopting a light-touch approach to regulation after Brexit – dubbed the “Singapore-on-Thames” model by some critics – would likely prove controversial.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 4Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.After hosting the Golden Globes from 2010 to 2012, Gervais returned to the ceremony in 2016 – and chose to devote part of his opening monologue to joking about Caitlyn Jenner, who had recently come out as transgender and was documenting her transition publicly. “Hey @RickyGervais. It’s 2016. Jokes at the expense of trans people are so tired. Catch up,” GLAAD tweeted at the time. Gervais has since doubled down on this line of comedy in a Netflix special. In September 2019, he tweeted: “You can joke about whatever the f*** you like. And some people won\u0027t like it and they will tell you they don\u0027t like it. And then it\u0027s up to you whether you give a f*** or not. And so on. It\u0027s a good system.” Hence, the bottom spot in this ranking.Fresh off a particularly biting 2011 hosting set, was Gervais struggling to figure out just the right amount of meanness for the ceremony? The comedian didn’t seem quite like himself that time around. He delivered some good lines, among them: “For any of you who don’t know, the Golden Globes are just like the Oscars, but without all that… esteem” and “The Hollywood Foreign Press have warned me that if I insult any of you, or any of them, or offend any viewers, or cause any controversy whatsoever, they’ll definitely invite me back next year.” Still, this year doesn’t stand out in Gervais’s Golden Globes history.In 2011, Gervais’s jokes were so incisive, so daring and – let’s just say it, mean – that they elicited occasional gasps from the audience. Over the course of the evening, the comedian took aim at the 2010 film The Tourist starring Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie (“It seems like everything this year was three-dimensional, except the characters in The Tourist,” he quipped), Robert Downey Jr, and the president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which organises the Golden Globes. Gervais’s set was so controversial that some wondered whether it would prove to be his last – but the comedian has now been invited back three more times.Gervais’s first turn as host was also his best. Almost 10 years ago, the comedian proved to be a delightfully sarcastic emcee, capable of the most ferocious take-downs. His best lines of the night were delivered with fake enthusiasm, such as when Gervais – the creator of the original version of The Office in the UK, tore into the US version starring Steve Carell (“Where does he get his ideas from?” Gervais mused). The 2010 ceremony also included this brilliant bit about writers in Hollywood: “This next category is a bit of a downer, to be honest: it’s for writing. We all know writers get way too much credit in Hollywood, and that’s due to the generosity of actors sometimes mentioning them.” And let’s not forget what is perhaps Gervais’s most celebrated Golden Globes quip, through which he introduced Mel Gibson to the stage: “I like a drink as much as the next man,” Gervais said, glass in hand. “Unless the next man… is Mel Gibson.”After hosting the Golden Globes from 2010 to 2012, Gervais returned to the ceremony in 2016 – and chose to devote part of his opening monologue to joking about Caitlyn Jenner, who had recently come out as transgender and was documenting her transition publicly. “Hey @RickyGervais.

When they arrive at the Earth\u0027s ionosphere, they excite the oxygen and nitrogen atoms found in the upper atmosphere, and that energy is released as lights.Created with Sketch.Northern Lights across the UK - in pictures Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The beautiful colours of light shining through the Sycamore Gap at Hadrian\u0027s Wall in NorthumberlandThe sky surrounding St Mary\u0027s Lighthouse in Whitley Bay, NorthumberlandThis shot was taken in NorthumberlandThe beautiful skies could be spotted across the sea in Giant\u0027s Causeway, Northern IrelandThe lights seen over Great Park in NewcastleA beach in Saltburn, North YorkshireThe beautiful colours of light shining through the Sycamore Gap at Hadrian\u0027s Wall in NorthumberlandThe sky surrounding St Mary\u0027s Lighthouse in Whitley Bay, NorthumberlandThis shot was taken in NorthumberlandThe beautiful skies could be spotted across the sea in Giant\u0027s Causeway, Northern IrelandThe lights seen over Great Park in NewcastleA beach in Saltburn, North YorkshireWhile the northern lights are often seen as one phenomenon, they are something like clouds: there are a whole host of different kinds, each of which are formed in their own particular ways.The new discovery began when the University of Helsinki\u0027s\u0026nbspMinna Palmroth looked to collect these different kinds of northern lights, in collaboration with enthusiasts. Those hobbyists took photographs of thousands of different examples of the northern lights, which she picked through and categorised for a book to guide those watching the\u0026nbspaurora borealis.A complete guide to the Northern LightsBut as the hobbyists collected those images through Facebook, they found that many of them included a kind of auroral form that was not part of the existing classification. Those were set aside to be examined later, and the book was published.Just days after it came out, enthusiasts spotted the mysterious form again: they saw a green-tinged, even set of waves that looked similar to dunes on a sandy beach. They told Professor Palmroth, who was able to get to work looking into it.One of the most memorable moments of our research collaboration was when the phenomenon appeared at that specific time and we were able to examine it in real time, says Northern Lights and astronomy hobbyist\u0026nbspMatti\u0026nbspHelin\u0026nbspin a statement.The hobbyists and space researchers worked together to collate photos from across Finland. Combining the images – and looking for clues such as stars in the background – allowed the scientists to discover where exactly the lights were coming from.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Their waveform stretched 45 kilometres across.That height put them in a particularly neglected part of the sky: it is where the Earth\u0027s atmosphere collides with the edge of space, and is difficult for satellites to see.Due to the difficulties in measuring the atmospheric phenomena occurring between 80 and 120 kilometres in altitude, we sometimes call this area \u0027the\u0026nbspignorosphere\u0027, she said in a statement.The phenomenon appears to happen because of the bore phenomenon. Scientists say that gravity waves are born in the atmosphere and then rise up – but when they hit a particular layer, they can be bent and stretch out for long distances.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) in Hawaii — which is twice the size of the next largest solar scope — have captured an array of cell-like structures that cover the surface of the sun, each taking up space roughly the size of the US state of Texas.It is hoped that by focussing on these areas, scientists may be better able to predict changes in the sun’s surface — including solar flares that can knock out power grids and put satellites at risk.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFrance Córdova, National Science Foundation (NSF) director, said: “Since NSF began work on this ground-based telescope, we have eagerly awaited the first images.\u0026nbsp“We can now share these images and videos, which are the most detailed of our Sun to date.

His partner, Jade Samuel, is currently on maternity leave and is due to return to work in two weeks, but won’t be able to if he\u0026nbsphas left the country, which he said would leave her “struggling to cope”.Mr\u0026nbspNembhard, who has been fighting his immigration case for years, said: “I’m really depressed. I cry when I think about my child. It’s really sensitive because I’m the world to her, and she’s the same to me. We have a really close bond and this is all starting to affect her.“My partner will struggle to cope. I don’t know what I’ll do if I have to leave my kids. The Home Office is destroying their lives.”The Jamaica charter flight is an outrage – but so are many othersDozens to be deported on first Jamaica charter flight since WindrushThe Jamaican national arrived to the UK on a visit visa in\u0026nbsp1999. He met his ex-wife and applied to remain in the country with her but his application was refused.He continued to fight the case but was accused of assault by his ex-wife\u0026nbsp– whom he had by this point separated from and got together with Ms Samuel – an allegation he still denies.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe courts found him guilty and he was sentenced to prison shortly after his daughter was born. He was then immediately detained under immigration powers, before being released on bail and settling down in\u0026nbspLondon with Ms Samuel\u0026nbspand their daughter.In February 2019, he was one of several Jamaicans\u0026nbspthreatened with deportation despite being key witnesses in the inquest into the death of an immigration detainee – but he was granted last-minute reprieve after solicitors intervened.Without immigration status, Mr Nembhard has been unable to work, but Ms Samuel, who works as a supervisor at a jewellery wholesalers, said the family “makes it work” as he is able to care for the children while she works.“He’s an amazing dad. He is their primary carer. I want to be able to work and continue providing for my family. If he is deported I’ll become a single mum, I’d have to rely on benefits. I’ve never had to do that. It took me a long time to get to this position at work but this means I will have to stop working,” she said.“When he was detained on Monday, I did the school run instead of him. My daughter asked, ‘Where’s dad? Has he gone to that place again?’ She’s been emotional. I’ve had to let her school know. She keeps asking when he’s coming home. They’re really close.Dozens to be deported on first Jamaica charter flight since Windrush“The immigration situation has really shaken us up over the past few years. Every time we get a bit of stability, they seem to take him away again. He deserves to be with his family. Here is where his life is.”Mr Nembhard was detained despite the fact that he had a “further submissions” appointment with the Home Office in March where his immigration case was going to be reconsidered.David\u0026nbspLammy, the family’s local MP, condemned the Home Office for putting them in this situation, saying the lives of Mr\u0026nbspNembhard’s\u0026nbspBritish wife and children were being “devastated” by the department’s “gross mishandling” of the case.The Labour MP said more broadly\u0026nbspthat it was wrong for the Home Office to be chartering deportation flights to Jamaica and other parts of the Caribbean before the delayed\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspreview has been published, adding: “How can the home secretary be sure she is not making the same mistakes?”Naga Kandiah, of MTC Solicitors, who is representing Mr Nembhard, said his detention was making it difficult to effectively prepare for his Home Office interview in March, and accused the Home Office of acting in a “harsh and heartless” manner towards\u0026nbspBritish children and their parents.“Without notification, Mr Nembhard was detained. Due to the complexity of his case, we need to obtain all of his past papers from previous solicitors, coroner’s inquest papers, instruct medical and social worker reports, but we cannot do this as effectively as he is incarcerated,” he said.“His family are suffering due to the absence of Mr Nembhard at home. His British wife and British children are not only deeply worried by him being incarcerated with no certainty, but also, struggling to cope as a family unit in day to day activities.”The Home Office confirmed that it would be operating a charter flight to Jamaica in the coming weeks and said those being deported had all been convicted of crimes in the UK.A spokesperson added: “Foreign nationals who abuse our hospitality by committing crimes in the UK\u0026nbspshould be in no doubt of our determination to deport them.

It seemed like there\u0027s a disconnect.When he approached the candidate at a small campaign event at Urban Dreams in Des Moines, Mr Fallon says he was expecting Mr Biden to address the concerns I was raising about climate change.Instead, he says, he was surprised that Mr Biden appeared to deflect his support, should Mr Biden be selected as the Democratic nominee in the general election, during which he ostensibly would want to earn Mr Fallon\u0027s vote.He just made it more difficult, Mr Fallon says.Mr Biden has pushed back against several would-be voters throughout his campaign, including telling an immigration activist in South Carolina to vote for Trump and telling another man in Iowa — who the candidate also called a damn liar —\u0026nbspthat he\u0027s too old to vote for him.On his website, Mr Fallon writes that his most recent exchange is disturbing on a number of levels.He said: His propensity to violate personal space is a huge non-asset in politics, and his frequent gaffes are prime fodder for opponents and the media. ... Most important, Biden is simply wrong on climate change, and out-of-step with voters on so many issues.Mr Fallon says he supports Mr Steyer for his track record of environmental advocacy and promise to declare a climate emergency on the first day of his administration, if elected.On Twitter, Mr Steyer addressed Mr Biden, telling him: This is no way to treat an Iowan. He said he\u0027d vote for the Dem in the general bc he knows how important it is to beat Trump. We need immediate action on climate. If you don\u0027t agree, happy to talk @ debate.

German courts ruled egg producers could continue grinding male chicks to death until a scaleable means of determining the sex of an embryo in an egg was found.Shredding of chicks is permissible under EU law, so long as death is instantaneous and the bird is less than 72 hours old.\u0026nbspChick-fil-A to end donations to anti-LGBTQ organisationsHundreds of songbird chicks starve to death in European heatwaveSame-sex penguin couple have welcomed their first adopted chickParent bird spotted feeding cigarette butt to chickMr Guillaume said the same timescale would apply to banning the castration of piglets without anaesthesia, according to AFP.Boars are usually castrated to encourage animals reared for meat to put on weight, and because fat in the meat from uncastrated pigs can apparently gives off a more potent smell when cooked, and is known as “boar taint”. But boar taint only usually affects 20 per cent of uncastrated pigs.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We would like to draw readers’ attention to the fact that sadly, the UK egg industry treats male chicks as though they are inanimate waste products, not living, breathing animals who are all iniduals and feel pain and suffering. They are routinely gassed at just a day old.“Laying hens, even in free range systems, can be crammed many thousands at a time into noisy, dusty, filthy sheds, some never able to access the outdoors. This is a far cry from the deceptive imagery on egg box packaging, with happy hens roaming freely in the sunshine, abundant grass underfoot. Once their laying declines and they are no longer deemed economically viable, they are typically crammed into crates and trucked off to the slaughterhouse at just a fraction of their natural life.\u0026nbsp“But really, we have no need to use and abuse animals in food production. The best thing we can do to help end this shocking cruelty is to give up eggs and other animal products and embrace a cruelty-free, vegan diet instead.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

So far  people have been tested across the country - all have been confirmed negative by the Department of Health.The World Health Organisation is not yet calling this a global emergency - but how deadly is this outbreak Existing data concludes a rough fatality rate of two per cent, meaning one in  people die of the infection. Some  to  per cent of cases are severe, meaning people require hospital treatment or ventilation as the disease causes a pneumonia-like illness.While the SARS-like virus, known as -nCoV, is fast becoming an international cause for concern, it is still a far cry from the virus pandemics in the past, which have ravaged entire countries and claimed millions of lives.Here we take a closer look at the worst ever pandemic viruses to date.It was a case of pass the plague in  A.D. when an early case of smallpox broke out.Known as the Antonine plague, it began with the Huns who then infected the Germans, who passed it onto the Romans whose troops spread it throughout the Roman Empire.Galen, a Greek physician, witnessed the outbreak and recorded the symptoms: blackish diarrhoea, which suggested gastrointestinal bleeding, intensive coughing, foul-smelling breath and red and black skin eruptions all over their body.The total deaths have been estimated at five million, and the disease killed as much as one-third of the population in some areas and devastated the Roman army.This plague continued until about  A.D, claiming Emperor Marcus Aurelius as one of its victims.From  to  an outbreak of the Black Death ravaged Europe, Africa and Asia, with an estimated death toll between  and million people.Thought to have originated in Asia, the Plague most likely jumped continents via fleas living on rats that lived aboard merchant ships.It took ten to fourteen days before the plague killed off most of a contaminated rat colony, by which time, after three days of fasting, hungry rat fleas would then turn on humans, their bite causing a swelling – or “bubo” — most often in the groin, on the thigh, in an armpit or on the neck.Hence the name bubonic plague.The infection took three to five days to incubate in people before they fell ill, and another three to five days before, in  per cent of the cases, the victims died.The Black Death began in London in the poor, overcrowded parish of St. Giles-in-the-Field and ended up wiping out  percent of the population during that terrible summer.When it hit a household, the house was sealed, a red cross painted on the door and the whole family was condemned to death.Dead bodies became so prevalent that many remained rotting on the ground and it created a constant stench.The Spanish flu pandemic, often regarded as one of the deadliest in history, killed an estimated million people of the million it infected as it tore through Europe in  and travelled to the US, killing , Americans.By comparison, the First World War, which ended in , had around million deaths.The first wave of the  pandemic occurred in the spring and was generally mild with the sick experiencing typical flu symptoms such as chills, fever and fatigue then recovering after several days.However, a second, highly contagious wave appeared with a vengeance in autumn of that same year and victims died within hours or days of developing symptoms, their skin turning blue and their lungs filling with fluid that caused them to suffocate.At the time, there were no effective drugs or vaccines to treat it. Citizens were ordered to wear masks, schools, theatres and businesses were shuttered and bodies piled up in makesht morgues with many having to dig graves for their own family members.It became known around the world as the Spanish flu, as Spain was hit hard by the disease and not subject to the wartime news blackouts that affected other European countries.What separated the  flu pandemic from other influenza outbreaks was the victims — instead of killing young people and the elderly, it struck down completely healthy young adults, while leaving children and those with weaker immune systems still alive.By the summer of , the flu pandemic came to an end, as those that were infected either died or developed immunity.Asian Flu was a pandemic outbreak of Influenza A of the HN subtype that originated in China in  and lasted until .In the first few months, it spread throughout China and its regions but by the midsummer it had reached the United States, where it initially infected relatively few people.Several months later, however, numerous cases of infection were reported, especially in young children, the elderly, and pregnant women.The pandemic also reached the UK and by December a total of , deaths had been reported in England and Wales.Estimates for the death toll y depending on the source, but the World Health Organization places the final tally at approximately million, , of those in the US alone.The Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus transmitted primarily by the aggressive blood-sucking Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and symptoms included fever, rash, joint pain and red eyes.In May , the first local transmission of Zika virus was reported in Brazil and researchers believed the virus was introduced during the August  World Sprint Championship canoe race, held in Rio de Janeiro, which attracted participants from four Pacic Island nations, including French Polynesia, with active Zika transmission.The virus soon spread and affected more than .million people in  countries, thanks to the mosquito’s ability to thrive in city le, flourishing in litter, open ditches, clogged drains, old tyre dumps and crowded flimsy dwellings.The virus was also linked to thousands of babies in Brazil being born with microcephaly, a neurological disorder where the baby had an underdeveloped brain and an abnormally small head.There were also a rising number of stillbirths and miscarriages in mothers infected with the virus.The children that did survive faced intellectual disability and developmental delays.From the first reported case on July ,  in Hong Kong, it took only  days before outbreaks of this virus — referred to as the Hong Kong Flu — were reported in Singapore and Vietnam, and within three months had spread to The Philippines, India, Australia, Europe, and the United States.While the  pandemic had a comparatively low mortality rate, it still resulted in the deaths of more than a million people, including , residents of Hong Kong itself, approximately  per cent of its population at the time.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It began in the far eastback in  and since then, has spread to Italy, Argentina, Mexico, South Africa and Vietnam, where it’s presented by Hoang Rapper. Seriously.Five weeks ago the global pandemic reached Britain and those millions of us who were infected have spent an uncomfortable month trying to work outThe Masked Singer is so bad it’s good or merely so bad it’s an affront to humanity.Somewhat reluctantly, I’ve finally got to admit it’s the former, despite having more than enough self-inflicted wounds and production flaws to sink most programmes.The Masked Singer is, for starters, no sort of contest, and while some of the singers, like Chameleon Justin Hawkins, disguise their identity brilliantly, John Barrowman could no more hide his showbiz light under the Large Hadron Collider than he could a unicorn outfit.There are also issues with that hopelessly random , Jonathan, Rita, Davina McCall and Donny Osmond Ken Jeong, who are either deliberately muddying the waters or are actually thick and deluded enough to believe a Joel Dommett-fronted show might also feature “Margot Robbie”, “Ray Winstone”, “Gemma Arterton”, “Helen Mirren” and “Olivia Colman”, in fancy dress outfits.God knows, it must be hard for them to confront the idea The Masked Singer is now the biggest thing in their careers. The only people I actually feel sorry for, though, are the poor dancers who’ve suffered the torments of hell on this show.The absolute worst of which was doing the twist, wearing only towels and snorkels, while that trippy octopus thing sang Splish Splash standing up in a bath. Yet still I watch. Why  Well, I’ve no realistic choice when the alternative is as tedious as BBC’s The Greatest Dancer.But I’d also choose The Masked Singer over X Factor, The Voice UK and practically any other Saturday night alternative the two main channels have served up recently, for the simple reason the basic guessing game concept and the end-of-show reveal are infuriatingly brilliant.Indeed, I’d go so far as to say Tutankhamun removing his head to reveal former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is one of the TV highlights of the year so far. Inevitably, the overlong shows, repetitive nature of the process and relative disappointments, like discovering it was Kelis in the daisy outfit, will quickly cure me.I’m sticking with The Masked Singer for now, though, because a slightly better bet than Natalie Cole has just reared its head in the duck outfit. After several weeks insisting it was a Spice Girl, Jonathan Ross now thinks: “It could be Diane Abbott . . . ”And, you never know, she might even do her own version of a Spice Girls song,  Become . I’ve rarely wanted anything more.BEST TV hour of the past week was Channel ’s SAS: Who Dares Wins, despite the fact its contestants were only visible for about  per cent of ­Sunday night’s show.Rest of the time they were blotted out by a gigantic Atlantic p***-storm which had engulfed the beautul and brutal island of Raasay, on Scotland’s west coast, so that all you could actually see were some green blobs lumbering up and down the mountains and all you could hear was swearing, from Ant Middleton.Or Foxy. Or possibly Billy. Or maybe even Ollie. “Put the casualty on the f***ing stretcher. Grab the f***ing stretcher and f***ing get him off the f***ing hill. That’s how we f***ing do it. Now move.”A big ask, I think you’ll agree, and the only one who seemed equal to it was James, an estate agent, who’s cracked every single challenge but not a single smile since episode one.He has, however, hinted at a very dark backgroundand claimed, with an entirely straight face: “It’s dficult to sayI’m good at hiding my emotions, ’cos I don’t have many.”No sooner had he said it, though, than Ant and the boys were pressing play on a Skype message from his mum. “Hi Peanut!” At which point James turned into a blubbing, schoolboy wreck.THE burning issue and question on Channel ’s mind last night was Bring Back The Bush: Where Did Our Pubic Hair Go  Where indeed  If it isn’t exactly where you left it or down the back of the sofa.Who worse to investigate this pressing issue, then, than Chidera Eggerue, the creative force behind the “Saggy Boobs Matter” campaign, who clearly craves attention and victim status but hasn’t worked out any better way of getting them than by making a gigantic exhibition of herself.So she’d set herself a real “challenge” here. “I’m growing my pubic hair for the next six weeks.” Exactly the sort of zero-effort empty gesture millennials seem to love.Chidera wasn’t quite confident enough in the project to go it alone, though, so she’d roped in four other minge martyrs to sprout away, while she went to LA to gawp at a porn shoot and work out why it was all the fault of men and the media.With the help of some anecdotal cobblers and an old copy of Playboy, Chidera eventually established the “flawless, hairless women” era was all about blokes “policing women’s bodies”, and the only way to fight back was, as I’d feared: “By revealing our bushes to the world.”When push came to shave, though, two of her mates insisted on wearing massive pants for the climactic photoshoot, the smartest one opted out completely and Chidera herself unveiled something that could’ve been her chuff, but could just as easily have been Ben Kingsley in All Hail The King. Bring Back The Bush  Bring back National Service first, please.But I honestly don’t think they’d get it even then.THIS week’s winner is Susanna Reid and Penny Proud from the Proud Family cartoons.Emailed in by Ricky J.

So why risk it Why ignore other major nations who banned Huawei  Why gamble that the US is bluffing about limiting security tiesChina has our data in its grasp Boris is desperate to roll out lightning fast broadband nationwide by the next election, as promised.Banning Huawei would set that back, as we line up US or EU tech giants instead.Surely better, though, to risk political embarrassment than endanger national security and have this threat hang over us.WE know he has an election to win, but we hoped Irish PM Leo Varadkar had got past belittling Britain over Brexit.And his claim that the EU is stronger than us simply because it has more people is childishly naive. It’s not about population, or the Swiss would be humiliated in their bilateral trade deals.Our economy is far healthier than the EU’s. We are a vastly more attractive place to invest.

At times since the decisive referendum vote in , it looked asBrexit would remain a distant fantasy, thanks to the determination of much of the pro-EU establishment to overturn the result.But in the end, the will of the public has prevailed over federalist ideology. The dream of national freedom is about to become a reality.This change in status will represent a daunting challenge for Britain. No longer a regional province in the EU’s empire, we will take charge of our own destiny, with control over our economy, borders, laws, trade and justice system.With self-governance comes tremendous responsibility - and doubts and concerns about trade deals. But our nation can rise to the test.Indeed, Brexit could be the cue for the renewal of our institutions and the rebirth of our democracy.After all, we have achieved so much in the past as an independent nation, pioneering Parliamentary rule, leading the Industrial Revolution, and defeating tyranny in two World Wars.Given this heritage, there is no reason why Britain cannot embrace a new era of greatness.Yet that is not how the embittered Remainers see our future. Immersed in their worship of Brussels, obsessed with goal of European integration at the expense of nationhood, they continually preach the gospel of defeatism and despair.According to their gloomy propaganda, Brexit is a disastrous mistake, which will leave Britain hopelessly in decline.In their view, our country cannot survive on its own. The cold winds of isolation will be felt outside the warm embrace of the EU federation.This is the message that the pro-EU brigade has been peddling for years, ever since the referendum was first proposed.During the  campaign, the Government embarked on its notorious Project Fear, full of grim warnings about the dire consequences of abandoning our EU membership.One Treasury paper predicted that a vote for Leave would “represent an immediate and profound shock to the economy,” followed by a massive rise in unemployment and a meltdown in sterling.But these dire forecasts have not been realised. Instead, since , the British economy has proved to be remarkably robust.There has been no recession, no collapse in the property market, no explosion in the dole queues. On the contrary, the British jobs miracle has continued to accelerate.Only last week, official figures revealed that unemployment is down to its lowest level since , while the national workforce is at its largest in history.Particularly striking is the rise in self-employment to over five million, which indicates that the culture of enterprise is flourishing.Investors have not been deterred by Brexit.According to the Financial Times, “UK equities are positioned to outperform their peers in Europe and the USA.Manufacturing is also poised to prosper. Last week a survey by the Confederation of British Industry highlighted the biggest surge in confidence within this sector on record.Commenting on the “bullish” economic mood in Britain, the distinguished German journalist Alexander Von Schoenburg, editor-at-large of the bestselling BILD newspaper, wrote last weekend: “I see a nation with a strong sense of purpose, built on trust in its own capabilities and a powerful economy.I see a vibrant, open place that can attract huge amounts of foreign investment, has an unrivalled record in business start-ups and is a global pioneer in scientic and genetic research.”Von Schoenburg is right. Our independent future can be a golden one. Already the International Monetary Fund, which in  warned of recession, now predicts that over the next two years, economic growth will be twice as fast in the UK as in any other G state in Europe.What the pessimists ignore are the huge advantages held by Britain, like the global dominance of the English language, the cultural reach of our arts, music and entertainment industries, the strength of our financial services and the solidity of our political system - which was recently demonstrated again in the defeat of Jeremy Corbyn’s quasi-revolutionary Labour party.A recent poll of , chief executives, carried out by the consultancy firm PwC, found that the UK is increasingly attractive to global businesses looking for growth and investment opportunities.Commenting on the survey, PwC’s chairman Kevin Ellis said that “viewed against the turbulent global backdrop, the UK is a beacon of relative stability.”Indeed, on the eve of Brexit, the real crisis is faced, not by Britain, but by the EU and its member states.Whereas Britain can show its dynamism by the embrace of global competition and commerce, Europe is still trapped in outdated economic structures, characterised by heavy regulation, state intervention and unaffordable welfare.Almost every European nation is now in trouble, dragged down by sluggish growth and political dislocation.While Germany hovers on the brink of recession, France is in turmoil because of ferocious opposition to attempts by President Macron’s Government to reform its vast public sector and expensive pension schemes.Spain is now in the grip of socialism, Italy in economic sclerosis. Ireland’s current General Election is unlikely to give any one party more than  per cent of the vote, a recipe for more fragility.For the EU itself, Brexit represents a threat to its very existence.That is not just because of the loss of Britain’s budget contributions, signicant though they are.It is more becauseBritain prospers outside the EU, then the justication for Brussels rule would be permanently demolished.All the claims about the necessity of political integration would be exposed as delusions. That is why pro-EU campaigners so dread the possibility of a booming Britain on the continent’s doorstep.Our success would be the EU’s nightmare.There is, of course, no guarantee that Britain will flourish.There could be dficult times ahead, prompted by a global recession or the refusal of the USA to reach a trade deal because of security objections to the involvement of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei in our broadband network.Equally, the EU might prove tough in its own negotiations with us about a trade agreement. Already this week the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has warned that the EU has “the upper hand” and the “stronger team”.But the cause of British independence has triumphed over serious obstacles in the recent past.With determination and vision, our country can do so again, emboldened by the taste of freedom.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She can only take kg of hand luggage and she came here with about kg of stuff.She also has to make her own way from the airport in London to Lancaster and then self-isolate for  days.Thats after she potentially comes into contact with hundreds of people on her way - it is ludicrous.The killer coronavirus was spread from bats to snakes to humans, experts have claimed.An outbreak of the virus is understood to have started at an open air fish market in the Chinese city of Wuhan - which has since been put in lockdown after  people died and more than  people were infected globally.A new study published in the China Science Bulletin this week claimed that the new coronavirus shared a strain of virus found in bats.Previous deadly outbreaks of SARS and Ebola were also believed to have originated in the flying mammal.Experts had thought the new virus wasnt capable of causing an epidemic as serious as those outbreaks because its genes were dferent.But this latest research appeared to prove otherwise - as scientists scrabble to produce a vaccine.In a statement, the researchers said: “The Wuhan coronavirus’ natural host could be bats … but between bats and humans there may be an unknown intermediate.Meanwhile, scientists at Peking University also claim that the deadly virus was passed to humans from bats - but say it was through a mutation in snakes.The researchers said that the new strain is made up of a combination of one that affects bats and another unknown coronavirus.They believe that combined genetic material from both bats and this unknown strain picked up a protein that allows viruses bind to certain host cells - including those of humans.After analysing the genes of the strains the team found that snakes were susceptible to the most similar version of the coronavirus.It meant that they likely provided a reservoir for the viral strain to grow stronger and replicate.Snakes are sold at the Huanan Seafood Market in central Wuhan and may have jumped to other animals before passing to humans, they claim.But a senior researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, who asked not to be named, said the findings should be treated with caution.He told the South China Morning Post: “It is based on calculation by a computer model.“Whether it will match what happens in real le is inconclusive.“The binding protein is important, but it is just one of the many things under investigation. There may be other proteins involved.”The expert believes that the new strain was an RNA virus, meaning that its mutation speed was  times faster than that of a DNA virus such as smallpox.Lecturer Yvonne Grfiths, who is currently in a hotel in Wuhan, said she received news in the early hours of Wednesday morning that there is to be a flight from Wuhan airport to England.She told BBC Breakfast that Stansted is a possible destination, but that has not been confirmed and timings had not been been firmed up either.And weve to be on stand-by so that we can go to the airport very early, she said.Weve to be there six to seven hours before the flight leaves, and we would have a screening from some health people here in Wuhan, andwe are not showing any symptoms then well be able to board that plane.If we were to be suffering temperature or any other symptoms, breathing problems, then there seems to be a possibility of quarantining at this end.The lecturer told the programme: It has been frustrating up until today. I think the lack of certainty about the time of this flight isnt so worrying as long as we know that its going to happen.Prior to that, we had quite a long period of silence from the UK Government about whether there was going to be any contingency plan to get people home.A British teacher living in Wuhan, who asked not to be named, said that a number of other Britons she was in contact with had arranged tohome, with some scheduled on a flight at am on Thursday. The departure of that flight has now been blocked.The death toll in China from coronavirus has risen to , with confirmed infections surging to around ,.Four cases have been confirmed in Germany, making it the second European country to report cases, after France.In Australia, officials unveiled plans to evacuate its nationals from Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, with plans to quarantine them in the Christmas Island immigration detention centre.The Department of Health and Social Care said on Tuesday that  people in the UK have been given the all-clear for the virus, although scientists predict it may have already entered the country.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said officials are working urgently to get Britons out of Hubei province.He added: Due to the increasing travel restrictions and the public health situation, we now advise against all but essential travel to China.The Foreign Office has said UK nationals in China should make decisions based on their own personal circumstances over whether to leave other parts of the country.Following the latest Foreign Office travel advice, consumer group Which  said people with trips to China planned should be covered for cancellations by their travel insurance.Adam French, from the organisation, said those already in the country should be entitled to be flown out or be compensated for any changes to their itinerary.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The first one is of a young man holding a sign that reads: ‘Be kind to everyone you meet. It goes a long way.’Other messages included in the story read: ‘Kindness is when my teammates lt me up in tough times,’ ‘kindness doesnt cost a thing,’ ‘be there for each other,’ and ‘were all in this together.’The story concludes with a final message from the Duke and Duchess: We are so happy to be supporting Bells mental health campaign.”“Each time you watch @bell_letstalk official video on Instagram, Bell will donate  cents towards Canadian mental health initiatives.So please share, please talk and be part of the solution.The plea was finished with a Canadian flag emoji.The campaign is the first new initiative Meghan and Harry have promoted on their social media accounts since they stepped down as senior royals.It could mark the beginning of the Sussexes’ path to collaborating with media and commercial companies, as they embark on their path to become financially independent.Until now Harry and Meghan have been “prohibited from earning any income in any form”, but this has now changed after they stepped down as senior royals.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have launched a new website, registered in March  and developed in Toronto – the young family’s new home town, as they split their time between Canada and London.When in Britain they will also continue to use Frogmore Cottage as a base - the homes in the grounds of Windsor Castle gted to them by the Queen.While they said they will continue to support the Queen, they will no longer formally represent Her Majesty.Prince Harry last week revealed his great sadness at leaving the Royal Family but claimed he had no other option.In a speech before leaving for his new home in North America, the royal told a Sentenable crowd: It was so many months of talks after so many years of challenges.

He will surely find himself in court very soon.This week a senior US attorney, Geoffrey Berman, said the prince had offered “zero co-operation” to the FBI and prosecutors.This is over his friendship with the paedophile sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.Andrew admits he kept his friendship going with this horrible financier for longer than he should.No kidding, your highness. You still visited the bloke after he had been convicted of having sex with an underage girl. There has been no convincing explanation as to why you should have done so. Indeed, when you tried to explain it, on TV to the BBC’s Emily Maitlis, you sounded both deluded and deceitful.But there’s worse, of course.

She is one of five women bringing a suit against the now dead Epstein and they want Prince Andrew to testy.Andy denies ever having laid a finger on Roberts.

The sensible thing to have done would have been to speak to the US investigators right at the outset.Becauseyou’ve got nothing to hide, there’s nothing to worry about, is there, matey But Prince Andrew’s actions have not appeared as the actions of a man with nothing to hide. He has preicated at every stage. He needs to understand that just because he says he is innocent of everything, it doesn’t mean everybody has to believe him, you know And there are plenty out there who certainly do not believe him.Sources close to Prince Andrew say he is “angry” and “bewildered” over the accusation that he offered the FBI zero co-operation.Well sure. He’s always bewildered. He’d be bewildered by a piece of paper with “see other side” written on both sides. He’d be sitting there trying to work it out for ages. He is not the sharpest tool in the box.If you’re angry and bewildered, your royal personage, then give the FBI a ring first thing tomorrow morning, US time, and tell them you are anxious to help in their inquiries.Because until this business is sorted out, there is a dark cloud over the Royal Family. And thus a dark cloud over Britain.The terrible suspicion is that our Royal Family is coming apart at the seams.Put all of our minds at rest, Andrew. Talk to the police. And tell the truth.THE Scots have banned the smacking of children by their parents.Braying the bairns was a kind of national sport up there.

It seems certain people are jumping the gun.Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, has dismissed this claim, and stressed the FBI has made several attempts to contact Prince Andrews representatives.It has previously been reported the FBI had been trying to interview the under-fire royal since November.Mr Bermans office revealed the prince’s lack of cooperation on Monday during a dramatic press conference outside Epstein’s mansion.He said: “The Southern District of New York and the FBI have contacted Prince Andrew’s attorneys and requested to interview Prince Andrew, and to date, Prince Andrew has provided zero cooperation.”The top prosecutor said he was revealing the information because the prince “publicly offered, indeed in a press release, to cooperate with law enforcement investigating the crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators”.Speaking at the press conference – held to promote a new law to make it easier for child sex abuse victims to sue – Mr Berman said the probe into Epstein’s network was continuing.Virginia Roberts, an American mum-of-three and now , claims she was forced to have sex with the prince three times when she was a teenager, after being trafficked to him by Epstein.The royal has vehemently denied her claims.Sigrid McCawley, who represents Ms Roberts, said: Prince Andrew should take most seriously the deeply held belief in this country that no one is above the law.She added: Prince Andrews continued refusal to cooperate with the authorities after freely acknowledging that he would be prepared to answer enquiries raises even more questions about the role he played in the international sex trafficking ring Jeffrey Epstein and others operated.Jack Scarola, another lawyer representing Ms Roberts Giuffre, told The Sun: “It is obvious that Prince Andrew is persisting in a pattern of non-cooperation which is now been going on for years.“I would certainly believe that he should recognise his moral obligation to participate in the search for the truth.“With all that the victims of Jeffrey Epstein have been through – over so many years – I would say that they expected nothing dferent.”Andrew claried his intention to co-operate with the FBI following his disastrous interview with BBC’s Newsnight in November.During the BBC interview, Andrew said he would have to consult with his lawyers before testying under oath about his ties to Epstein.But in a statement after the broadcast, he said: “Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations,required.”FBI and federal prosecutors in Manhattan are trying to bring justice for dozens of Epstein’s victims – by going after his alleged accomplices.Epstein, , killed himself in jail last year while awaiting trial on child sex trafficking allegations – following numerous bungled probes into his conduct.Prosecutors had accused him of sexually exploiting dozens of women and girls in New York and Florida before he hanged himself.Shortly after Epstein’s death, Mr Berman issued a statement vowing to continue the investigation into his co-conspirators.They are now said to be zeroing in on Ghislaine Maxwell – a close friend of Andrew – who is alleged to have acted at Epstein’s ‘pimp’.Maxwell – who is currently in hiding – has denied any wrongdoing.Andrew was forced to quit as a frontline royal last year, following his car crash chat with Emily Maitlis on Newsnight.During the interview, he suggested that a photograph showing him and Ms Roberts together in the home of Maxwell was faked.He said he had “no recollection” of meeting Ms Roberts Giuffre and claimed he was at a Pizza Express in Woking on one of the days they were meant to have had sex.When asked whether he regretted continuing his friendship with Epstein, the prince said: “Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming  Yes.”“Unbecoming ” Miss Maitlis replied. “He was a sex offender.”A Buckingham Palace spokesman declined to comment on the FBI claims last night, but a source close to the prince said: “This issue is being dealt with by The Duke of York’s legal team”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There have also been instances of protesting fire- fighters setting themselves alight — albeit with fire extinguishers on hand to douse the flames.You are much more likely to have seen these disturbing scenes on social media than on the television news, probably because such images don’t fit with the anti-Brexit narrative of most UK broadcasters.You see, it was supposed to be Britain that collapsed into chaos, while our continental neighbours basked in the stability allegedly afforded by European Union membership.Most of us are vaguely aware that the image we are often presented of President Emmanuel Macron as the smooth-talking glamour boy of modern European politics is somewhat at odds with the situation on the ground in his country.We have heard a bit about the gilets jaunesprotesters who have been staging huge and sometimes violent protests every weekend across France for more than a year now.But despite France being our closest continental neighbour, we don’t quite know what is going on or why — mainly because these extraordinary scenes are so seldom explained or even covered by flagship news programmes.The truth is that civil stre in France, including the sheer level of violence and fury now being directed at its political establishment and at the police who enforce their will, is in danger of spiralling out of control.In painful contrast to La Belle Epoque, the famous “beautul era” of creativity and gracious living France enjoyed for the  years before the First World War, the country is now sliding into Le Mal Epoque — the bad times, which show little sign of ending.The immediate cause of the latest protests is Macron’s economic reform programme, a dose of unpleasant medicine the French economy probably needs to digest but which its powerful and militant trade unions have no intention of allowing to pass.Macron aims to abolish ious “sweetheart” pension deals enjoyed by dferent occupations, including many public sector groups, and create in their place a single national pension scheme he says will be more affordable and fairer for all.Some groups face having their pensions calculated on their career average earnings for the first time, rather than their final salaries at retirement, as  separate schemes are rolled into one. Everyone is faced with working longer, as the retirement age rises from  to  .Macron is also taking a tougher line on the pay and traditionally quite lax working practices of French public sector employees, which is what the firefighters have taken particular objection to.A six-week transport strike has just ended, while the country is also suffering from a wave of power cuts as electricity workers withdraw their labour.When you throw into the mix other major social problems, such as the alienation and chronic high unemployment suffered by youths from ethnic minorities in the “Banlieues” — grim outer estates that encircle Paris and other major French cities — and the ever-present threat of Islamist terrorist atrocities, then the multiple sources of pessimism and anger among the French public become clear.And that is before the famous gilets jaunes are taken into the equation. These protesters, mainly provincial, traditionally-minded people from small towns and villages, began their demonstrations as a protest against punitive new rates of tax on petrol that Macron had introduced to the acclaim of environmentalists and other fashionable metropolitan groups.That grievance has now morphed into a more general contention that Macron is a president for the rich and well-connected.Leftist union leaders have started to ape the language of the gilets jaunes.Firebrand Philippe Martinez — a kind of French Arthur Scargill — says Macron and his inner-circle are disconnected from reality and need to “shake the hands of a few who actually work”.In British terms, modern France is perhaps best likened to our experience in the s and early ’s, characterised by excessive trade union power, strikes, riots, terrorism, outbursts of police brutality and a general pervading sense of aggression on the streets.With the next French presidential election shaping up as a choice between more Macron or Marine Le Pen, with her Far-Right connections, some in France have started to look across the Channel for a better example.Leading lights in the centre-right Republican Party have even praised Boris Johnson as offering, “a third way between globalists and populists”.As Britain gets ready for a Brexit knees-up tomorrow, with no sign of violence despite the years of political angst we have gone through, we should count our blessings.Many in France would give almost anything to be in our shoes right now.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There may be other proteins involved.”The expert believes that the new strain was an RNA virus, meaning that its mutation speed was  times faster than that of a DNA virus such as smallpox."},{"url":null,"title":"burger pastie rival ram","story":"Benjamin Harbour, , was filmed hitting Scot Weller, , with his van after waging an eight-month campaign of abuse.Mr Weller, owner of Over The Top Cornish Pasties, had been warned by Harbour to get off the industrial estate where they delivered food.After several incidents, cops told him to record any rows.

The Chancellor promised just months ago that no department would have to shrink their budgets in . But today he wrote to cabinet ministers, asking them to draw up cuts of up to % of their spending plans. They’ve been told to go through their budgets “line by line” and be ready to justy any spending plans and projects they want to keep. In the note, Mr Javid wrote: “We have been elected with a clear fiscal mandate to keep control of day to day spending. “This means there will need to be savings made across government to free up money to invest in our priorities.”  But in Mr Javid’s spending round speech, just three months before the election, the Chancellor declared he had “turned the page on austerity.” Mr Javid said: No department will be cut next year. Every single department has had its budget for day to day spending increased at least in line with inflation. Thataposs what I mean by the end of austerity.Labouraposs Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: We were promised by Johnson and Javid that austerity had ended and the cuts in public services were over. They clearly aren’t on this evidence. Another Johnson lie exposed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"baby undergoes now never surgery","story":"NewsBaby undergoes now or never surgery in mums womb after heartbreaking diagnosisWARNING - GRAPHIC IMAGE: Joanne Crellin, , was  weeks pregnant when she went to Belguim so that doctors could perform now or never surgery on her unborn son with spina bidaShareCommentsByJonathan ColesLottie GibbonsNeil Murphy:,  JAN NewsJoanne Crellin with baby Blay \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA mum has revealed her heartbreak at learning her unborn son had spina bida and needed to operated on while he was still in the womb. Joanne Crellin, , was  weeks pregnant when she flew to Belgium to try and fix her unborn childaposs spina bida.Spina bida is when a babyaposs spine and spinal cord donapost develop properly in the womb, reports the Liverpool Echo.The condition leaves vital nerves exposed as the pregnancy progresses, causing irreparable damage. Mum-of-four Joanne was shocked to be told about the issue when she had her -week scan. Just two months later she claimed she had been informed everything was fine two months earlier. She said: Shaun [her partner] and I were laughing on the way into the hospital - thataposs what gets me. They gave me a leaflet after I was told [about the spina bida] and I couldnapost even look at it - I felt physically sick. Itaposs still something that really upsets me.  She had to rush off to Belgium because there were no surgeons available in the UK. Joanne was also informed that her baby had hydrycepahlus- which helped her make the decision. She was asked to stay near the hospital in Liverpool following the successful operation on October  - meaning she was away from her family for three months. She then gave birth to little Blay on December  via caesarean section.  The effect of the surgery is currently unclear and could be for some time, only becoming evident as the baby grows. But Joanne, from Douglas on the Isle of Man, is just happy that sheaposs given her boy a fighting chance. She said: When I touch his feet they donapost move at all - they donapost clench. Itaposs quite obvious he doesnapost have any feeling. He wonapost have full sensation - it would be deluded to think so. But he might have another operation which can bring back a bit. The biggest reason was I wanted to prevent him having a shuntbecause of where I am. If he did, every time it became blocked I would have to travel to hospital in Liverpool.  And, after the shunt has happened,you put them down to sleep it can be fatal - I wanted to protect him from that. At first I wasnapost sure about having it but I went home and researched what the outcome was. Because in spine bida the nerve endings are on the spine, itaposs the amniotic fluid around the baby that actually causes the damage. As the pregnancy progresses the baby is getting bigger and pressing the nerve endings against you - which are getting squashed. All the damage is done in the womb but the fetal surgery covers the exposed nerve endings so you canapost have further damage. Fetal spina bida surgery was first carried in the UK in .  Joanne had to undergo a series of tests after she agreed to the surgery during her -week scan including genetic testing, a psychological assessment and an MRI scan. She then packed her bags and went to London for what she expected to be an overnight stay - but actually beginning a whirlwind three months. She said: The next day I was sitting in a café waiting for my MRI when the hospital rang me and said they already had someone booked in for surgery for the date I would have to have mine. So, the only way for me to be able to have it done would be to go to Brussels. I asked them when I need to go and they said: aposWell youaposve got an appointment there at tomorrow at  oaposclockapos. I thought: aposHow am I supposed to get to Brussels apos. I didnapost even know where it was!  A friend came to her rescue and booked her on the Eurostar and into a hotel for two nights. Joanne added: I was then in the hospital family room for two nights and then I had the surgery. At first they were finding things with his brain and they werenapost sure about having it done but then they said it was fine. Joanne stayed in Brussels for a week following the successful operation on October  then flew back to Liverpool. She was advised to stay in the city until the birth as there was a high risk of rupture - forcing her to check into a nearby bed and breakfast for the next few months.  Blay was then born on December  via caesarean section at Liverpool Womenaposs Hospital and stayed in intensive care for four days. He was then moved to Alder Hey Hospital where staff pulled out all the stops to get the baby home in time for Christmas. Itaposs now a matter of waiting to see how successful the surgery was as Blay starts to grow - but thereaposs every reason to be hopeful. Joanne said: They did say to me in Brussels that my surgery was an hour quicker than theyaposd done it before and they managed to get four layers on him when usually they would get three. He no longer has hydrocephalus and his cerebellum was pulled down but now itaposs coming back into its proper position. You canapost tellhe will need a shunt but Iaposm feeling positive that he wonapost and he does have feeling in his legs apart from his feet. Itaposs known as a apossnowflake disabilityapos. You can have a baby that has the area on their spine affected in exactly the same place but the outcome wonapost be the same.

Mr Wood said: An interview date was sent to Ms Baker. This subsequently got cancelled. Ms Baker was then informed that she had to complete a set of interview questions over email. She completed these questions and a few days later she received an email confirming she had got the job. This was celebrated with Dove, who gave her victim a congratulations card. During the next seven months Kimberley was sent thousands of emails from ious supposed council members, giving her ious administrative tasks while feeding her excuses as to why her employment had not yet begun.These ranged from computer system failures to introductory meetings with key figures being cancelled due to weather problems. After going months without pay Kimberley confronted Dove and asked her for evidence that she worked at the council. Unconvinced by what she produced, the disgruntled employee went to the council where knowledge of Doveaposs employment was denied. Over the course of the strange scam Kimberley had lost £, in missed earnings at BT, while leaving her paranoid. She had been forced to cancel her wedding due to the financial impact. Her trust for Dove had run so deep Kimberley had asked her to be her chief bridesmaid and had visited potential wedding venues with her. Zahra Baqri, defending, said Doveaposs motive was not to cause her victim financial loss but a desperate and misguided attempt at keeping her friendship.  She said Dove lacked her own domestic unit, she craved that domestic closeness and wanted to help Ms Baker, but created a scheme that snowballed. Ms Baqri added: She says she did not know how to get herself out of the mess she had created and at the same time maintain the friendship. Sentencing Dove, Judge Robert Warnock said a psychological assessment revealed no signicant mental health issues. However, he refuted the idea that Dove had not intended to cause Kimberley financial loss, because she continued the scam after she share her mounting money problems. The judge added: You went to extraordinary s to perpetrate this complex, cruel and harmful deception.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA mum who endured two miscarriages on the same date in the same hospital room one year apart has finally given birth to a ‘miracle’ baby. Katie Bonful, , went through years of heartache before she finally gave birth to her son, Maximus, now seven months old. Mum-of-one Katie miscarried her first baby after experiencing some heavy bleeding during her second trimester on March  . She fell pregnant again, but went into early labour and miscarried in the same hospital room at St Thomas, Westminster, on March  . Katie fell pregnant for a third time in August  and had a high chance of premature labour so had weekly check-ups until she went into labour at  weeks. She gave birth to healthy lb oz boy, with Katie and her husband Richard, , describing rainbow baby Maximus is a ‘miracle’. Katie, an admissions officer, from Dartford, Kent, said: “Going through a miscarriage once is heartbreaking enough, let alone twice. “I couldn’t believe it when I was in the same room twice, going through the same thing again on exactly the same date but one year on – it was like a nasty déjà vu. “It was devastating but when I fell pregnant with Maximus I had some hope again. When he was born, I couldn’t believe he was actually here but I still felt worried. “I just wanted to hear him cry and when he did I was screaming for joy – I was so happy. He’s my little miracle.” Katie and husband Richard, head of maths at a school, couldn’t wait to start a family and were overjoyed when she fell pregnant in November . Everything seemed fine at the  week scan but Katie grew concerned when she started getting cramping and bleeding just before her  week check-up.  Doctors broke the devastating news that the baby was unlikely to survive and Katie went into labour – giving birth to a ‘leless baby boyapos at St Thomas Hospital on March  . Katie said: “My husband and I had been married for around four years and were ready to start trying for a family. “Suddenly I started bleeding everywhere – the whole cubicle was covered in blood. I was completely devastated and I felt numb. “I was so excited and had just started telling people I was pregnant. Nothing can prepare you for losing a child and we grieved for a long time.” Katie fell pregnant again at the end of  and tragedy struck for a second time when she went into early labour again at just over  weeks. She lost her second child, in the same hospital room at St Thomas Hospital, on the exact same date, one year later, on March  .  She said: “The second time I was getting ready for work and I felt strange. I thought the baby was having a growth spurt. “It felt like I needed a wee – like a pressure down there – so after work I went to the hospital. “They scanned me and saw that my cervix had opened and the fluid around the baby had started to flow out. They said the baby was unlikely to survive. “They contemplated an emergency stitch but onlythe pain and bleeding stopped but it didn’t. “I was in labour for about eight hours and my second son arrived stillborn. I couldn’t believe when it started happening again. I thought Iaposd know what it felt like, but it was dferent to the first time so I had no idea. “This time I was  weeks and five days along and it fell on the exact same date that I’d miscarried the year before. “Not only that but I was in the same hospital room and the nurses even recognised me. The cautious mum fell pregnant for a third time in September  and doctors closely monitored her throughout the pregnancy. As there was a chance of miscarrying again, they performed a cervical stitch, a treatment to stop the cervix from opening too early during pregnancy. Katie made it to  weeks and five days – giving birth to a healthy little boy Maximus who weighed lb oz on April  .  She said: After the second miscarriage my husband and I prayed for another child and said aposthis time next year, weaposll have our little boy.apos Having faith really helped get through such a dficult time. “The moment Maximus was born I was waiting for him to cry and the second he did I literally screamed in joy. “It was the most amazing sound I’d ever heard. “He’s such a little fighter – he was our little ‘rainbow’ baby because he arrived after the storm.

The Dreadnought in Leith, Edinburgh, describes itself as old skool and a pub that knows how to party. It won the Campaign for Real AleCity of Edinburgh Pub of the Year award in  and . But the trendy boozer has raised eyebrows by putting a sign in the window - telling men they will not be allowed inthey are dressed head-to-toe in grey marl trackies, or wearing shoes with no socks. The Dreadnought is also considering a ban on flip-flops. A sign, reading gentlemen’s dress code depicted a man dressed in a grey tight-fitting tracksuit cuffed at the ankles and trainers, described as jobby catchers. Another image showed a man wearing a leather jacket and turned-up jeans, with bare ankles and smart shoes - circled in red to draw attention to the fashion aposfaux pasapos. The move was welcomed by some people, who called for the ban to be extended to other items of clothing. Gary Saddler said: “Their pub. Their rules. And I agree with them. Iaposd add baseball caps and beanies to the list.” And Henry Campbell Gillan added: “Definitely no men in white socks.” Jenny Mitchell said: “Anything that encourages our younger menfolk to dress better should be applauded.” Some called for rules to be implemented for female punters too.  Andrea Peutherer said: “Yet lassies can strut in half naked. Very classy.”A post on the pub’s Facebook page defended accusations of snobbishness, claiming people in tracksuits just make the place look scruffy.“We do our best to keep the place looking reasonably smart and,the first you see when you walk in is a group of lads wearing matching grey marl jobby catchers, we may as well have installed a beaten up bus shelter in the corner and invited folk to take a slash against it, the post read. “Just to prove our sartorial prejudices cross all boundaries, we’re also taking a stand against this horrendous current trend of half mast jeans, bare ankles and shoes. “If you’re going to base your fashion choices on what the staff at Urban Outfitters were wearing, there’s a place created especially for you. “It’s called Brewdog.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rather bringing more kids world","story":"w.mantis  Colin and Sharon Jamison had two beautul little girls, but they always knew they wanted to have more children.  nWe thought over time that there are a lot of children out there who donapost have homes, Colin told .  nRather than bringing more in to the world, letaposs look after the ones already here.  nThat was  years ago, and since then the couple, who live in Belfast, have dedicated their time to helping to raise children as foster parents.  nTheyaposve had more than  children through their door with placements lasting anywhere between a few days and  years.  nColin, , said: We’ve had children who have had multiple carers before us and have lost their identity along the way.

Throughout their many years of fostering, the couple have cared for children with a wide range of needs and behaviours, including young people with challenging behaviours, teenagers and those with le-limiting disabilities. Speaking as part of Barnardoaposs Fostering Week, Colin says that as a foster carer “you have to look past what you’re seeing on the exterior and find the young child.” The coupleaposs daughters Nicola and Samantha were six and three when their first placement arrived, and Colin and Sharon admit they were worried about how it might affect them. Sharon said: That was a concern for us. They had to be our priotity. Luckily the girls loved having a new friend to play with and have always been very supportive of having other children in their home. They were really happy about it. They understood that some children need a bit of support. Theyaposre very caring girls. As theyaposve grown up theyaposve got more and more involved. Our eldest did get a bit jealous with our first placement, but she was able to come and talk to us. We understood that and made sure everybody felt included.  Their longest placement was a little girl who had motor neurone disease, who stayed with them from the age of nine until she passed away aged . Sharon said: We were told she couldnapost talk or communicate, she couldnapost even smile. She was just the most amazing wee girl. It was just like a flower opened up when she could give expressions, her eyes just sparkled. She passed away while living with the Jamison family. She had a really lovely le. She had fun and she never complained even though she was in a lot of pain. She inspired up and kept us going. Everybody around her, social workers, family, came together to make sure her le could be good. We look have very positively, everybody made her happy. The couple attended a Barnardoaposs information event after a friend saw newspaper advert at the same time they were discussing the idea of fostering behind closed doors and gave to them by complete chance.  Colin already knew about the incredible work Barnardoaposs does as some of his school friends lived in one of their childrenaposs homes. The couple now focus on giving the children who stay with them happy memories from their childhoods in a bid to ensure they have nice things to look back on when theyaposre older. He said: When children come in to a strange environment they seem a bit confused and scared. Itaposs great having chuldren who are close in age to them. As adults we stand back and let the children do a lot of the engaging. They soon settle in to the routine. Sharon adds: You can have a child that settles within a few weeks and feels like theyaposve been here forever. But some donapost settle for years. The couple once looked after one boy who packed his bags every time they had an argument as he was convinced they would say they had had enough of him and kick him out, even though he had lived with them for four years.

Scotland Yard has asked Neil Berriman, , to pass on all the evidence he has collected in his four-year investigation to find the missing killer. Neil, the son of nanny Sandra Rivett, who Lucan is suspected of murdering in , said: “I’m pleased they are taking it so seriously.” After his claim was revealed by the Mirror yesterday, the building contractor is now due to meet Det Insp Susan Stansfield, of the major inquiries special casework team at Putney police station in South West London. Neil said: “I know DI Stansfield is out of the country working on another investigation so I am pleased ... she will be meeting me at the first possible opportunity.I am very grateful for the police’s quick response.” The Mirror revealed that Neil had spent £, of his own money trying to track down Lucan and claimed to have found the elusive peer living as a Buddhist in Australia. Neil has already told Det Insp Stansfield about the eight aliases he believes the man has been using.And he has passed on the address where the man is living. Lucan would now be . Scotland Yard said: “The inquiry into the death of Sandra Rivett remains open, as is the case with all unsolved murders. “It has never been closed. Any signicant new information will be considered.”Lucan disappeared shortly after Sandra was bludgeoned to death. George Bingham, the son of the peer who has been th Earl of Lucan since his father was declared dead in , said he had been unaware of Neil’s search.The -year-old added: “I’ve met him a couple of times but had no idea he was looking for him and had spent so much... “He isn’t the first person to go to Australia looking.I remember the press went out there to try and find my father and instead found John Stonehouse who had faked his own death.”He added: “I am very sceptical about this. I had seen the story and it does seem odd. It would not be the first time someone has made a mistake. “This is all ancient history. It happened in  and now it’s . I guess people will always go on looking and they are welcome to do so.” He also revealed that on December , he and his we had a baby son Charles, who is in line to become the th Earl of Lucan. The Earl said: “I’ve more important things to worry about such as sleepless nights. My son is not sleeping very well.” Shortly after the murder, Lucan drove to the home of his friends in East Sussex and wrote a letter to a pal, asking that his children be looked after because he was going to lie low “for a bit”. ‘Spotted’ on a volcano and at ex-Nazi colony There are a huge number of theories on what became of Lord Lucan and long list of “sightings” – from backpacking on a volcano to living as a hippy in India. Some believe he boarded a ferry at Newhaven, others think he got on a private jet at Headcorn in Kent to fly across the Channel where he was picked up by a limo.  And one source insisted he had committed suicide and his body was then fed to tigers at the Kent zoo owned by his pal John Aspinall. Det Chief Supt Roy Ranson, who led the original murder investigation, claimed in his book that he believed Lucan fled to Africa with the help of influential friends. He was convinced that the discovery of Lucan’s car in Newhaven was a red herring. He also believed Lucan flew to Portugal in a private plane belonging to former Formula One champion Graham Hill, who died in . Later “evidence” suggested that Lucan was in Mozambique in . The first reported sighting of Lucan was in January  when he was supposedly spotted in Melbourne, Australia. Five months later he was “seen” in France at Cherbourg and St Malo. Police in South Africa examined fingerprints, supposedly left on a beer glass by Lucan in Cape Town. Sightings were reported in southern Africa, first in Mozambique and then Zimbabwe, and there were even claims he lived in India as a hippy called “Jungle Barry”. He was also “spotted”at an ex-Nazi colony in Paraguay, a sheep station in the Australian outback and backpacking on Mt Etna, Sicily. In , Barbados Police were asked by Scotland Yard to investigate reports that a British resident was sending money to Lord Lucan in South America. An ITV drama claimed the peer had been spirited away by wealthy friends, including Sir James Goldsmith and Aspinall.

Passengers were let down by a private company that overcharged and under-delivered. The new timetable was a disaster, delays a daily occurrence, overcrowding routine and cancellations commonplace. The Tories have finally ­realised this could not continue and have taken the service back into public ownership. Northern Rail’s customers will only really notice a dferencethe Government starts to invest in new track, electrication and signalling. The demise of Northern Rail should sound the death knell for rail privatisation. The policy, rammed through by John Major, is a total failure. It is not just in the North that passengers have been fleeced by train operating companies, as bosses have grown fat from public subsidies while providing an appalling service for ever-higher ticket prices. The only thing preventing the Tories from ending this fiasco is their ideological blindness. It is time for the blinkers to come off. If it makes sense to take Northern Rail into public ownership then it makes sense that the rest of the railways should be nationalised.

It’s not justice The Grenfell Inquiry has already heard that firms which made and installed the cladding knew it was a potential fire risk. Now these companies are demanding immunity from prosecution before staff give evidence. This is deeply insulting to the survivors and the families of the victims, who deserve the truth. Anyone who withholds evidence adds further stress and anguish to people who have already suffered unimaginable trauma and grief.

Grieving Lissie, who had only been married to the police constable for four weeks when he died, branded Andrew amazing in a heartbreaking tribute. She was speaking as she accepted a posthumous award on -year-old Andrewaposs behalf from his colleagues on Tuesday. Lissie, now , said: “‪Andrew wanted to be a police man since he was a little boy, fuelled with enthusiasm and a contagious love for adventure that never left him when he grew into adulthood. “I thinkyou were to have asked Andrew what the most important thing about being a police officer was, he would say protecting the innocent from harm and being the barrier of strength and accountability against the guilty… evenhe had to stay on late and buy another kebab from the notorious kebab van that he loved to visit. “‪Andrew joined the Police force when he was  years old. He gained so much from every sht and every new team he joined.  I don’t think he felt totally contented until he joined Roads Policing. He began to thrive more than ever, whether he drove alone or had some company he soon made a name for himself as one of the most productive and motivated officers in Thames Valley Police. “‪I wish more than you could ever know that I wasn’t standing up here accepting this acknowledgement on behalf of Andrew, I wish in so many ways that he had been just a little less brave.But then he wouldn’t be the amazing person that he was. The silent protector going about his job without expectation or recognition.” Andrew died on August  last year while responding to a burglary call-out near the village of Sulhamstead, Berkshire. The roads policing officer was dragged under a car and died from multiple injuries. He and Lissie were due to go on their honeymoon shortly after the tragedy.  He was awarded the National Chair’s Certicate for representing “the very best of roads policing and policing in general” at the Annual Police Federation Roads Policing Awards in Kenilworth, Warwickshire on Tuesday evening. Lissie said: “I do want to thank you for this heartwarming show of appreciation to Andrew for all that he gave. If one thing is for certain it is the unbreakable bond between officers. A mutual respect and unspoken pact to stand strong together and to take care of the families of the fallen heroes.  “I for one have been touched and overwhelmed with the immense support I have been given from the police family. For that I am eternally grateful. I know deep down in my heart that Andrew had extreme faith in his roads policing team and all that he worked with.” John Apter, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, added: “Every day police officers run towards the unknown, putting themselves in harm’s way and risking their own safety to protect others.  “When one of us falls, their loss is felt by all of us in the police family. But we remember with pride, their courage, selflessness and dedication to duty. “These are the qualities we associate with Andrew. A certicate may seem a small thing, but it is genuinely meant with love and compassion. He is a hero who will never be forgotten.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman physically sick after new","story":"w.mantis  An ASOS customer said sheaposs been put off from using the online retailer after finding period stains in a new jumpsuit she had bought and tried on.  nRoxy Williams, from Bishopaposs Cleeve, Cheltenham, said she felt aposphysically sickapos when she realised the garment was aposstained with someone aposs menstrual bloodapos.  nThe -year-old ordered the £ floral patterned Desree Akorahson unitard last Saturday and when it arrived on Monday she excitedly tried it on before spotting the aposdisgustingapos blood stain, she told Gloucestershire Live.  nMs Williams said: Iaposm tall, so I struggle finding clothes that fit in regular high street shops, which is why I turn to places like ASOS.  nI had already tried the jumpsuit on that morning but it was only when it was laid inside out that I saw the stain.  n  nBest hairsprays for volume, hold and shine that are suitable for all hair types   nASOSaposs clever new tool lets you see what dresses look like on dferent size models   nAt first I naively thought Iaposd started my own period early but the stain was dry and it was obvious that it had been worn by someone .

Heidi Broussard was found dead in the boot of a car parked at Magen Rose Fieramuscaaposs house in Houston, Texas, on December . Inside the home was the victimaposs three-week-old daughter Margot, The New York Post reported. More than a month after the grisly discovery Fieramusca, , was indicted on charges of capital murder and kidnapping in connection with the -year-oldaposs death. In an affidavit unsealed earlier this month it was alleged that Fieramusca had concocted an elaborate baby-based hoax.  She had pretended to be pregnant for months in a bid to pass her friendapos baby off as her own. When Margot was born Fieramusca told her ex-boyfriend that he was the father and she had birthed the child on December  - the same day Heidi and the baby went missing. An autopsy determined that the mom’s death was caused by “ligature strangulation,” officials said. Fieramusca’s attorney Brian Erksine said her legal team had only learned about the murder charges through media reports.

Mrs Brownaposs Boys won the award for best comedy, and whilst the cast were overjoyed, the reaction from those watching at home was mixed to say the best. The comedy show went up against After Le, Fleabag, Derry Girls, Sex Education and came out triumphant. After the announcement, Twitter was ided, with some furious fans of rival shows comparing the win to ious other world catastrophes. One person said: Forget Coronavirus, Brexit, bushfires or tensions in the Middle East... Mrs Browns Boys won an NTA ahead of @rickygervais After Le! Stop the planet... I want to get off. But that wasnapost the only person to compare the win to Brexit, another person said: Brexit, Boaty McBoatface, and now Mrs Brownaposs Boys winning an NTA over Fleabag, Derry Girls, Afterle and Sex Education. The public are not to be trusted. And: This is worse than Brexit. This country cannot be trusted with anything. Creator Brendan OaposCarroll who also plays his drag persona Agnes in the show, stood alongside his we Jenner Gibney - Cathy Brown - as they accepted the award. The show is based off the popular theatre production aposMrs Brownaposs Boysapos, and follows the lives of Agnes and her family.

And a home win over Dunfermline shows their form in Inverclyde is just as good as it’s ever been.Morton finding their feet both home and away makes what is always a dficult trip an even stfer test for Dundee.Win and their quest for consistency starts anew – lose and the Dee and McPake could be staring down the barrel."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/19798931-897x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united 2 2 hibs appere solo goal earns united cup replay","story":"Louis Appere earned Dundee United a Scottish Cup fourth-round replay as they twice came from behind to draw with Hibs.Christian Doidge gave the Hibees a dream start after eight minutes at Tannadice before Lawrence Shankland scored a classy equaliser in first-half stoppage time.Martin Boyle put the visitors back in front with a powerful drive on  minutes before substitute Appere curled home a leveller on  minutes which earned the Terrors an Easter Road replay and a place in the hat for the last- draw.United showed five changes from the team which faced Partick last weekend with Jamie Robson, Calum Butcher, Ian Harkes, Peter Pawlett and Paul McMullan coming in for Adrian Sporle, Declan Glass, Nicky Clark, Louis Appere and Mark Reynolds.It was Pawlett#s first start for almost three months, with McMullan and Harkes seeing their first action since the last Dundee derby.What had been billed as the tie of the round got off to a frenetic start. And it was the visitors who almost took the lead after three minutes. However, Mark Connolly was in the right place at the right time to clear Florian Kamberi#s effort off the line.Hibs weren#t to be denied five minutes later, though, as they opened the scoring through a low Doidge effort. Slipped in by former Dundee man Boyle, the Welsh hitman coolly slotted under Benjamin Siegrist for -.On  minutes, straight from a United corner, the Hibees broke. Boyle was again the creator-in-chief, with his surging run into the Terrors# half leaving United back pedalling before Melker Hallberg saw his shot foiled by Siegrist.Kamberi again fired towards his fellow-countryman just before the half-hour but this time it was an easy save for United#s Swiss stopper.The Tangerines were struggling to get a foothold in the match and had created few chances as proceedings approached the half-way point. When Liam Smith found Harkes at the edge of the box to fire in a fairly innocuous shot, however, the mood seemed to lt around Tannadice.On  minutes, Siegrist again halted a deflected Kamberi effort from a matter of yards as the Hibees continued to press. United were starting to enjoy more possession, though, and went in at half-time with the tie level thanks to Shankland#s th domestic goal of the season.In the last of three minutes of added time at the end of the first period, Harkes strolled through the heart of the Hibs defence before sliding in Shankland to slot home from eight yards despite being under heavy pressure.United weren#t level for long, though, as two minutes into the second period the men from Edinburgh were back in the lead.Scott Allan played provider as he laid in Boyle to drive home low beyond an outstretched Siegrist from fully  yards.Kamberi#s battle with Siegrist continued on  minutes with the goalie again denying the striker#s thunderbolt from distance with the rebound just evading Boyle on the follow-up.Allan fired over just after the hour as the Terrors, again, fell out of the game as boss Robbie Neilson ordered their first change of the afternoon, sending Appere on for Pawlett.And young attacker Appere had the desired impact  minutes after coming on, picking up possession on the left before twisting and turning away from Steven Whittaker and then David Gray to curl a delightful effort beyond the helpless Ofir Marciano for -.Both teams pushed for a winner in the closing  minutes, with Siegrist pulling off a top save from Doidge in injury time, but it never came, meaning these two will have to do it all again a week on Tuesday in the capital.Dundee United : Siegrist , Smith, Watson, Connolly, Robson Harkes , Butcher , Powers McMullan, Shankland, Pawlett .Subs not used: Deniz, Sporle, Reynolds, Sow and King.Hibs : Marciano , Naismith , Porteous , Hanlon , Stevenson Hallberg, Allan, Whittaker Boyle, Doidge, Kamberi.Subs: Bogdan , Slivka, Newell, Horgan and Shaw.Ref: Kevin Clancy.Att: ,."},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive hibs kid fraser murray set for dundee loan","story":"Hibs youngster Fraser Murray is set to join Dundee on loan until the end of the season, Tele Sport can exclusively reveal.The -year-old midfielder is a product of the Hibees academy set-up and has made  appearances for their first team.The Easter Road club are keen for him to get more game-time under his belt and hope a switch to Dens Park will offer that.The Dark Blues hope to have the deal sewn up this week in time for Saturday’s trip to Morton.Meanwhile, club-mate Sean Mackie has ed to Hibs after picking up an injury in his temporary spell on Tayside."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/KCes_Craigie_High_School_Police_Incident_Dundee_200519-14.jpg ","title":"major shake up of education in dundee to be debated as plans to merge craigie high and braeview academy unveiled","story":"A massive shake-up of education provision in Dundee has been unveiled by council leader John Alexander .The far-reaching proposals brought forward by Mr Alexander and his administration would see:Subject to consultation, a new £ million superschool, merging pupils from Braeview and Craigie, could be built at the former St Saviour#s High with a projected opening of .Braeview was ravaged by fire in September .

We see this as the way and Dundee and Angus College would be involved in taking this forward, with enhanced provision.#Both these schools are grade C in terms of quality and both need upgrading but looking at the financial elements we cannot afford it.#The priority is in the east and we cannot have Braeview Academy people sitting in portable cabins.#Mr Alexander, a former pupil of St Saviour#s High School, outlined how #vocational partnerships# between Braeview and Michelin would be continued at the new campus at Drumgeith Road.He added that a joint project between Dundee City Council and Dundee and Angus College would be launched to accommodate people with additional support needs.Mr Alexander said: #I spoke with three executives from Michelin and we are really focused on making things work.#The consultation,approved by committee on Monday, would start on February  and run until the end of March. We have to be honest with the public and we want the feedback from parents.#This is the very start of the process. And as a parent your focus is absolutely on what is in the best interests of your children.#Part of the consultation process will be looking at proposals for Craigiebarns to be part of the catchment area for Grove. That would take effect from August , so again there is a lead in time to give people the time to give feedback.#He told how boundaries are to be changed to help accommodate the uneven mix of schools which are under capacity and those which are over capacity both in primary and secondary.Turning his attention to the over side of the city, Mr Alexander said: #The re-alignment catchment areas for Harris Academy would remove Invergowrie and they would go to school in Perth.#Meanwhile, the future of a  much-vaunted new primary is also hanging in the balance — at least in the short-term.The council leader hinted that he understood that was likely to be a controversial decision.#We have also had a very detailed analysis of how many pupils in the area of Western Gateway and which schools they go to,# Mr Alexander continued.#There are  pupils on site , but we need to address the other issues with the priority being at the east end of the city, so Western Gateway is not a priority. This is not the time to do it and we cannot construct a primary school on the basis of  pupils.#We are not saying no to the school, but it is just not the right time now.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

Bulman, builders Kelso who had been involved with BUAS since . To have had only two main Contractors in over  years is indicative of their skills and loyalties.Graham was very clever at school with a good practical brain and I heard from his le long friend, Andy Shortreed, that he was an expert at, among other things, technical drawing and would make all manner of things out of wood and other material.He was encouraged to study and utilise these skills while at High School in Hawick but Graham was stubborn! All he wanted to do was leave school and join his father, Bill, and be a fencer, which he duly did in .Countless number of farms and estates throughout the Borders have benefited from Grahamrsquos skill, as have the three core events at BUAS. His younger brother, Neil, was in partnership with Graham for a number of years before ing to utilising his skills with heavy plant machinery.I cannot have more regard and respect for Bill and Graham and how they nurtured me when I joined BUAS as Secretary in . I listened and I learnt from them all the ins and outs of both the Showground and preparing these massive annual Events and bringing them together in such a professional manner and with an uncanny calmness that sometimes was frustrating but one knew that come the day the target was reached. The Ram Sales have evolved over the last  years with many changes and updates and it was a pleasure working with someone who was always conscious of the huge responsibility he had to the many thousands of people, whose livelihoods were often very dependant on a good Ram Sales or a good Show, whether buying, selling, exhibiting, a Trade Stand, providing a service or a member of the public.Grahamrsquos other passion in le was his racing pigeons, which he has bred and raced for over  years - and for the last  with his friend and near neighbour in Lilliesleaf, Bob Spearman. They had many years of great fun and indeed numerous successes with their birds and it was always a great pleasure and exciting for those at the Showground when in the spring Graham would very often bring a crate of young birds when he came to work and released them as part of their early training. A master breeder even he did not understand how the young birds knew which direction was home!He had a great eye and would spend many long evenings just watching the birds to learn which would be potential race winners and which to keep as breeding stock. They had their fair share of success in UK races, whether from Edinburgh or the south coast of England but their biggest success was when one of their favourites ndash Bonnie Lad ndash finished th out , birds released from the South of France. No-one does fathom how these incredible birds find their way home and I believe these two wise owls were also baffled but enjoyed the discussion and banter over a pint or two in the local pub.

Christmas time had been dficult because it was the first Christmas without her granny, who had died earlier in the year. But now she was back at school and into the routine with her friends.Her parents had hoped this would help, but her sense of loss was still overwhelming for her. Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman. At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did. And now shersquos melting.The next day at school was another dficult one for Jessica, and home time often didnrsquot make it better because in the past it had usually been her granny whorsquod picked her up.Her dad was waiting for her.ldquoWe are not going straight home today, he told her.ldquoWhere are we going ldquoTo Nanarsquos seat.A cloud suddenly came over Jessica. She didnrsquot say anything and just looked at the ground. This was a seat that overlooked the sea, where her gran had often taken her. They would sit together and look out to the Firth, spotting boats and looking for whales, while eating sweeties.Her dad had realised that Jessica hadnrsquot been there since the death of her grandmother.ldquoOnlyyou want to, he said.Jessica was silent and looked at the ground. Inside, her emotions were spinning. Then she looked up.ldquoI donrsquot want to, it will just make me sad, she said to her dad. So they didnrsquot go.But later that day, Jessica began to talk about Nanarsquos seat. ldquoShe always gave me sweeties and wersquod look for whales and pirates. She told me a story about how a pirate once landed here at Prestonpans, but he didnrsquot leave treasure, he just built the town.ldquoGreat story, said her dad.The next day, Jessica agreed to go to her nanarsquos seat. When they arrived, she hesitated to sit and had a wave of emotion.ldquoI miss Nana, she saidldquoSo do I. Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat. Her dad joined her.ldquoNo, dad, that was Nanarsquos place, you sit this side instead.And so they sat, missing Nana together, being sad together, but also remembering her together.ldquoCan you tell me the story about the pirate  asked the dad.ldquoDonrsquot want to.ldquoOK, maybe next time.The next day, they ed to Nanarsquos seat. This time, Jessica told a bit of the pirate story. The dad remembered it from his childhood and realised that his own grief in losing his mother had closed him down to talking about her. It had felt too painful.He began to sit on lsquoNanarsquos seatrsquo by himself when Jessica was at school, even though he had never done it with his mother when she was alive he had always been lsquotoo busy to watch the sea with her. But his daughterrsquos anecdotes and stories about the seat made it feel like a place of remembrance for him too.The power of stories, to rekindle memory and ease the sense of loss, became very real for both Jessica and her dad. At home, they made a special box with drawings and photos of memories, and things that reminded Jessica of her gran. Theyrsquod take them out and tell stories and share memories. Her dad even began to tell funny stories about his mum from when before Jessica was born, when he was a boy.lsquoNanarsquos boxrsquo was put in a safe place, but where Jessica could take itshe wanted to. As time passed, she opened it less, but it was always in her room. Sometimes she would put things in it, such as shells from the beach, because her granny had loved beautul shells.The loss of a loved one can never be completely moved on from, so there were always going to be times of sadness.

It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"garry-oconnor-referees-haddington-amateur-teams-successful-charity-match","story":"Haddington Town FC took time out over the festive period for a special friendly in aid of Back Onside.Former Hibernian and Scotland striker Garry OrsquoConnor, who is an ambassador of the good cause, refereed the match, which saw members of the amateur teamrsquos squad come up against one another on January .Matt OrsquoConnell, chairman of the club, which was formed last year, said they were determined to help support the charity, which helps young people and adults who face mental health challenges.He said: ldquoWersquore a club that was founded on the idea of bringing local guys together into a positive social and active environment.ldquoItrsquos well documented that the highest proportion of suicide across Scotland is men aged - and thatrsquos something we hope to positively redress in our town by facilitating a great environment in which local guys can improve not only their physical but also their mental health.ldquoOur connection with the charity Back Onside was really born of their slogan, #SupportThroughSport, a powerful statement that really resonated with us.ldquoTheyrsquore a great charity who are doing a hell of a lot across the UK and so for us, a small amateur club barely nine months old, to play a small part in helping a charity who share our ethos was immensely rewarding.Haddington Town play on Sunday mornings in Division Two of the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football Association , alongside fellow county side Meadowmill.The charity match, played at Knox Academy, finished - in favour of the lsquoawayrsquo Haddington Town team.Libby Emmerson, founder and CEO of Back Onside, said: ldquoWe are beyond grateful for the support received from Haddington Town Amateur Football Club and guest referee Garry OrsquoConnor.ldquoAs a small charity with a huge clientele, community events such as the Haddington Town AFC charity match are key to raising funds and awareness so that we can continue to support those facing mental health challenges.Mr OrsquoConnell thanked everyone for their support, with the match raising pound, ndash more than double the target.He said: ldquoHuge thanks to Libby Emmerson, FES FM and Garry OrsquoConnor.

As with Northern Ireland, where a new border has been created between Ulster and mainland Britain on the Irish Sea, a parallel border arrangement would inevitably be required between Scotland and England in the event of an independent Scotland re-joiningthe EU.Depending on the outcome of the negotiations about to begin between the UK and EU on their future trading relationship, tarfs and quotas on trade may also be required between an independent Scotland and England to maintain the integrity of the EU customs union. By promising to re-join the EU after independence, the SNP would therefore be handing a gt to our Unionist opponents.They would weaponise the border issue in exactly the same way they did with the currency issue in the  Independence Referendum.The chances of winning the referendum would be unnecessarily and substantially weakened.These issues do not arisean independent Scotland is part of a free trade agreement but not in a customs union.

The central part in delivering this objective will be to ensure that jobs are directly created in Scotland through a coherent and co-ordinated industrial agenda with a green skills strategy at its core.He said it was \"essential\" the UK government reforms the Contracts for Dferencescheme, the main mechanism for supporting low-carbon electricity generation, which incentivises investment in renewable energy by effectively guaranteeing prices for renewable energy suppliers.Mr Rafferty said that job creation and local economic benefit targets should be established in future CfD auctions.Research carried out by YouGov has found that people of all ages, from all regions across the UK, are ldquolooking for a job with environmental purpose.

To turn the area over to commercial activities from November, with an unsightly and unpassable clear-up lasting from January to May, is to commandeer the place for more than half the year. Eight weeks would be acceptable  is not.Naturally, this eyesore wont be published on any VisitScotland website. Most sightseers wont ever catch a glimpse of this inglorious aftermath. Meanwhile, between now and the middle of May, those who live and work in Edinburgh must pass by and avert their gaze, wondering how their city became a mere pawn of the entertainment industry and not an illustrious capital of which they could once be proud. As one of many disgruntled locals tweeted, this is ruination \"in the name of greed\".I cannot think of a city of comparable elegance, venerability and wealth ndash a Unesco World Heritage Centre to boot ndash where the first thing you see as you emerge from the train station, or arrive from the airport is a wasteland. Welcome to Scotland! Here we dont roll out the red carpet, but ndash after an agonisingly long delay ndash we do renew the turf.Theres a palpable feeling at the moment that Edinburgh is undergoing seismic change, under our noses but without public consent. News last week that planning regulations could be relaxed to allow restaurants, cafes, and a host of other non-retail outfits to move into Princes Street is a fresh cause for concern. If approved, this new dispensation could mean that one of Europes most beguiling bouleds ndash the street that sells Scotland ndash could become home to a casino, cinema, or even a sports facility.Why should this concern us  Given the tawdry quality of some of the shops currently trading, wouldnt bright cafes or restaurants be a welcome improvement  After all, the array of tartan tat, cheap-as-chips fashion and even an emporium dedicated to sugary sweets ndash the smell alone could rot your teeth ndash is hardly in keeping with the magnicence of the venue.Yet given some of the poor decisions already taken by the councils planning committee, it is hard to feel confident that this incomparably lovely avenue is in safe hands. One member of the committee says the idea is to create a \"more authentic\" space. Im not sure what that means, but it sounds like double-speak for attracting lucrative footfall. And while pubs wont apparently be allowed onto the street, this relaxing of regulations extends to George Street, Hanover Street, Frederick Street and Castle Street. Like it or not, the face of the New Towns commercial district is set for a facelt.With the demise of House of Fraser at the West End, now transformed into a whisky experience, and towards the East End the once-beloved Jenners department store due shortly to close , the heart of the city is struggling to keep up with bewildering change. Fortunately, nothing so awful is in the pipeline as the notorious proposal some years ago to build an elevated shopping mall in the gardens. Perhaps the most worrying aspect of a less stringent commercial climate is the signal it sends, and the trend it looks set to deepen.Wherever you go, Edinburgh is turning into a visitor attraction, a living museum and gallery. Useful shops for locals are a rarity. In their place is a proleration of chic cafes, glitzy on-trend eateries and luxurious hotels, all pandering to the tourist market. Thanks to the make-over of old premises and investment in new, the capital has a superficial shine, a high-cost stylish patina. But as Dickenss Mr and Mrs Veneering showed, putting your faith in appearances is risky. Yes, it creates jobs, though mostly of a lowly-paid, transitory kind. But at what cost  Do people make the trip to Edinburgh for its pubs and coffee shops, or to soak up the atmosphere of culture, history and daily le that, over centuries, have made its name Princes Street has undoubtedly been in need of improving its image for a long time now. Some initiatives are to be welcomed, such as the Quaich project, to renovate the run-down Ross Bandstand, and to \"wild\" the western part of the gardens, so they look less like a postcard from the s and rather more invitingly freeform. While that is a laudable aspiration for one side of the street, however, the other is in danger of losing whatever soul it has left.I understand that the council is in a dficult position, trying to safe-guard the future of a district caught in the retail nightmare of swtly changing, quixotic customer behaviour. That it is hoping to welcome a greater ersity of trade suggests that in one aspect at least, human habits are unchanged: eating and drinking and watching the world go by. In fact, we are consuming far more than we ever did before, willing to spend money as well as countless hours sipping lattes and beer and scoffing burgers and sushi. So much for austerity. When it comes to leisure, wallets fly open.There would be nothing wrong with broadening Princes Streets commercial scopeyou could trust those at the controls. Sadly, I have no such faith. On the evidence of recent years, the citys development is geared towards immediate gratication, mainly for migrating flocks of cash-splashing customers. Where is the long-term perspective, tailored to the true character of the city, and to the requirements and concerns of those who live in it  Why bother to ask. Such a perspective requires serious thought, knowledge and imagination, luxuries the current decision-makers dont want to afford.

A new book by local historian Roy Pinkerton has been launched to coincide with the  years exploring the history of the  churches, which have united to form the present-day Greyfriars congregation.In September there will be a spectacular flower festival which will see the building filled with colourful displays paying tribute to the rich history of the  churches.Musical highlights include a performance of the Renaissance masterpiece Spem in Alium by the Scottish Chamber Orchestra Chorus, led by the conductor Gregory Batsleer on  February.During Lent, in a joint concert, the Dunedin Consort and Scottish Ensemble will perform Sir James Macmillanrsquos Seven Last Words from the Cross on March .Edinburgh Royal Choral Union plans a special commission for choir, soloist and organ from composer Thomas LaVoy November . This will develop the theme of religious freedom in honour of the kirkrsquos anniversary and the landing of the Mayflower in America  years ago.The kirkrsquos history spans five centuries and the free lunchtime concert series, Greyfriars at , will explore musicfrom each of them, plus othercelebratory themes. There will also be chances to get involved, with a ldquoCome  Sing Brahmsrsquos Requiem, conducted by Angus Tully on Aprill , and further events planned.Rev Richard Frazer, who has been the minister of Greyfriars Kirk since , said: ldquoChristmas  marks not only  years of our building but  years of our congregation, an uninterrupted history that has been sustained from the dawn of the modern era and an astonishing record of faith in action."},{"url":null,"title":"brian-beacom-ban-talking-footie-work-woke-madness","story":"But who would have imagined the writerrsquos Thought Police were in actuality a little bit of a soft touch  What George should have anticipated was an insane future world in which chat of Alfie Moralesrsquo Rangersrsquo future be banned, or indeed Leigh Grfithsrsquo position as a Celtic remainer be considered gender isive.And Orwellrsquos mind control theme didnrsquot even consider how water cooler talks over VAR should be forbidden ndash on the basis they will segue into talking about scoring with the blonde whorsquos just joined advertising No, I havenrsquot just booted the ball of credibility right over the bar with this argument becausewersquore not careful wersquoll end up taking the likes of Ann Francke seriously.Ann Francke is the Chartered Management Institute head who argued on Radio  this week that sports banter at work can exclude women and lead to laddish behaviour, such as chat about sexual conquests. \"A lot of women, in particular, feel left out,\" she told the BBCs Today programme. \"They dont follow those sports and they dont like either being forced to talk about them - not being included.\"Francke, in claiming that bosses should clamp down on sports debates, suggests herself to be both misandristic and stupid.To say that women donrsquot follow, donrsquot understand, football is absurd, indicating she spent last summer on another planet while the World Cup was taking place. Has she not noted the intendant publicity, the number of female commentators and presenters on football television, such as Gaby Logan, or indeed the number of women working in the sportsrsquo media Francke also does women a huge disservice by talking about females being ldquoforced to talk about sport. What does this entail  They go home at night and study up on the new contact laws in football  Does this also imply women have been banned from introducing their own blether subject matter into the office, that any mention of Love Island, for example, should result in being docked a half-a-dayrsquos salary Ann Franckersquos out-of-touch argument is either an exercise in self-publicity or a pathetic woke attempt to ingratiate herself with what she considers a feminist vanguard.Either is pathetic.But therersquos a bigger picture to worry about here. The gender ide is being prised further apart thanks to the insanity attacks from Twitter. There are already too many attempts to widen the gap by citing the many, many faults of men. Yes, we all know the days of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace should be ended, the sexism, the inappropriate touching, but what we donrsquot need is a ban on talking up Mo Salahrsquos incredible penalty box touch.What we donrsquot need are these endless suggestions on behaviour by people such as this Management person. Indeed, we need to cancel the phrase lsquoWe need to have a conversation.rsquo What we need is to let people breathe.And we need to assume women are perfectly capable of forming conversations, and indeed cover subject matter that involves more than the anodyne.I can recall women in our office once introducing that age-old talker lsquoHow much money would you want to sleep with so-and-so,rsquo chat, and of course it was fun ndash and revealing ndash to discover how little money was involved to get intimate with the office horrors. Would that be allowed nowadays Yes, Francke is right to urge chat based on commonality but thatrsquos simply an ideal. Herersquos the reality people talk about what is on their mind, whether itrsquos whorsquoll win the league ndash or why David Walliams feels taking his trousers down is the only way to achieve column inches.Ann Franckersquos comments will not help productivity in business. It will in fact further a schism which is not good for morale at all. Andshersquos talking about a ldquocrack down does this demand HR staff in jackboots kicking against the office kitchen door and carrying off any man who has been heard to mutter the phrase lsquoIrsquom really not convinced VAR works.rsquoWhat we all know is that the workplace can be a demanding, pressured, stressful environment in which we need moments of release. Depression rates are rocketing. We need release at work, and that release needs to be free flowing Former sports, gambling, charities and loneliness minister Tracey Crouchcalled the Chartered Management Institutes advice \"a load of nonsense\".But itrsquos worse than that. Itrsquos dangerous. Becauseanyone listens to Ann Francke wersquore all likely to become Winston Smiths.

We will continue to make that case as robustly as we can”.In further worrying news for Scotland’s islands communities, the Western Isles and Shetland are of particular concern with  per cent and  per cent of communities rated as the most vulnerable.The analysis, carried out by the Rural and Environmental Science and Analytical Services, breaks the map of Scotland down into , geographical units called datazones.Across these datazones a series of factors that put communities at risk to Brexit — not just a ‘no deal’ Brexit — have been plotted.These factors include: access to services, what share of the population is of working age, income deprivation, workers in Brexit-sensitive industries such as farming and fishing, EU worker migration and how many EU payments are received.The iables are then weighted and combined to form a single indicator for each data zone — the Brexit Vulnerability Index.The report is being released with an interactive online Brexit Vulnerabilities Index Map, which can be used by local authorities and other organisations as a tool to help plan for Brexit.Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said: “We always knew that Brexit could be damaging to Scotland, but this analysis lays out in stark terms how vulnerable communities across the country — urban and rural — are to its impact.“As a responsible government, we will do what we can to mitigate and minimise its impact: this study only underlines the scale of that task and the recklessness of the UK Government in continuing to pursue Brexit at any cost.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After Members of the European Parliament voted to back the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, they sang Auld Lang Syne, Robert Burns’ version of an old Scottish folk song about friendship, as a way to bid goodbye to the United Kingdom.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen quoted George Eliot, saying “Only in the agony of parting do we look into the depths of love”, and told the UK that “we will always love you and we will never be far”. Guy Verhofstadt MEP, the European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator, tweeted: “It’s sad to see a nation leaving, a great nation that has given us so much: culturally, economically, politically, even its own blood, in two world wars. It’s sad to see the country leaving that liberated Europe twice.”The outpouring of goodwill was palpable and obviously genuine.: Watch: MEPs belt out Auld Lang Syne as European Parliament backs Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal: Brexit: EU flag will fly at Holyrood after Brexit, after government overturns decision of impartial parliament bodyIn contrast, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage expressed the hope that the UK’s departure would be the beginning of the end for the EU. “It’s a bad project. It isn’t just undemocratic, it’s anti-democratic,” he claimed, ignoring the fact that Britain was leaving as a result of a democratic process.The vision of the world espoused by Farage, Donald Trump and other members of what some call the alt-right and others view as the far-right is of entirely separate nations in a state of constant struggle. So Trump, the US President who puts ‘America first’, makes trade war on countries who dare to act in their own interests. After France planned a new tax on tech giants, who pay infamously little, Trump threatened vast tarfs on its goods.If the EU collapsed and populist leaders in the Trumpian mould emerged across the continent, all promising to put one over rival countries with dferent agendas, how long would it be before those trade wars turned into something more serious The EU has helped keep the peace in Europe for a letime after millions died in two horrendous world wars. And the fact that the UK and Ireland were both members meant those who were prepared to commit murder in Northern Ireland’s Troubles began to look as foolish as they were callous and brutal.There are legitimate criticisms to be made of the EU and it should take Brexit as a sign of the need for reform. But it is of profound regret that the UK is leaving and The Scotsman wishes our “auld acquaintance” all the very best.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish teacher and family living on lockdown in coronavirus ravaged chengdu in china","story":"A teacher from Edinburgh who is living in a virus-ravaged province of China has told how he and his we and kids are living on lockdown in a \"zombie apocalypse.\"Speaking exclusively to the Evening News, Andy Nesbit said he and Chinese we Miaomiao Nesbit along with their two young children, are virtual prisoners in their apartment in the city of Chengdu, surrounded by rising panic as authorities struggle to combat the spread of the killer coronavirus.As the number of confirmed cases jumped above , Wednesday - surpassing the , in mainland China during the SARS outbreak in - - and countries began evacuating their citizens, Mr Nesbit said he was considering evacuating his family to a nearby country or even back to Scotland.: Why the coronavirus could lead to cheaper petrol in the UKAt the time of writing, there are currently  confirmed cases in Chengdu, capital of the Sichuan Province in southwestern China.And Mr Nesbit, who is originally from Leith, said that it seems to be getting gradually worse each day.The -year-old said: \"At first, people werent taking it that seriously until we went to a friends birthday party on January  and that seemed to be the only thing people were talking about.\"People use Wechat, which is like Chinas Whatsapp, to share information and you can definitely sense panic starting to kick in as the days pass.\"Chengdu airport is still open but some main motorways out of the City have been closed but I think one or two people have died in Chengdu, and some people think the numbers could be far greater.ldquoWhen we went to the supermarket the other day the roads were so quiet and on that short trip we saw a total of five ambulances screaming by with sirens on - you cant help but feel a bit freaked out by it - it is a bit like a zombie apocalypse.LockdownOn the precautions they have had to take, Mr Nesbit said they only ever leave the house to pick up food or essentials and that his two children, eight-year-old Alan and four-year-old Jack, had not left the flat for six days.He added: \"Every city is dferent but in Chengdu you have to wear a maskyou enter any public place.

Vocal residents raised concerns over West Princes Street Gardens being closed for events.Carol Nimmo, speaking on behalf of community councils, said the organisations “broadly support the objectives of the Quaich Project”, but are concerned the ambitious vision could lead to a “disproportionate scale of development”.Ms Nimmo said the business case had been brought forward due to “the chronic and systemic lack of investment in the gardens”, pointing the finger in particular at the Ross Bandstand. She said: “We believe that this business case is nothing less than a roadmap to the over-commercialisation of West Princes Street Gardens, yet another example of the corporate culture now dominant in the council.”David Ellis, director of the Quaich Project, moved to reassure the public that “the intent of this project is to not increase the number of those major events from what is currently there just now”.The council’s senior manager for culture venues, Karl Chapman, confirmed that while there were five “major events” held each year, added up they became  days where the gardens were taken over by major events.This number of event days would remain the same to “help support community activities” which would be expanded under the plans, Mr Chapman said.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"met office world likely to see new record temperatures within five years","story":"The world is likely to see a new record hot year within the next five years as temperatures continue to climb, the Met Office has said.Global temperatures for each inidual year between  and  are expected to be between .C and .C above the conditions the world saw in pre-industrial times, analysis shows.: Edinburgh ahead of Grand Canyon in list of  most awesome destinations for solo travellers in  It means the current record for the hottest year, set in  with .C of warming, is likely to be broken.The five-year period as a whole from  to  is also expected to be the hottest five years on record globally, with temperatures over the period predicted to be between .C and .C above pre-industrial levels.That compares to the temperature over the last five years, -, which showed an average warming of .C, making them currently the warmest such period on record, the Met Office said.Rising global temperatures, compared to a pre-industrial average between  and , are consistent with continued high levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere warming the planet, the Met Office said.The forecast, which is based on Met Office computer models, also estimates there is less than a one in  chance any single year in the next five years will breach the key threshold of .C above pre-industrial levels.The UNs climate science body has warned of the dangers of allowing global warming of more than .C, and countries have committed under the Paris climate deal to \"pursue efforts\" to prevent temperatures rising by more than that amount.But while there is less than a % chance of the .C threshold being exceeded in the next five years, Met Office head of long-range prediction Professor Adam Scae said that moment was rapidly approaching.: One million trees to be planted in Scottish Highlands in effort to restore wild salmon stocks \"Barring a large volcanic eruption, these predictions show that we are rapidly approaching the point where we will see temporary excursions of global temperature above the .C threshold,\" he said.Professor Stephen Belcher,Met Office chief scientist, said going over .C in an inidual year did not mean the Paris Agreement would be breached, as the scientists recommended curbing temperature rises to .C over the long term.But he warned: \"However, with our forecast showing a further warming trend, the window of opportunity continues to narrow.\"Dr Doug Smith, a Met Office fellow and expert on decadal prediction, said: \"The latest five-year forecast suggests continued warming, consistent with sustained high levels of greenhouse gases.\"Uncertainties exist within the forecast, but most regions are expected to be warmer and forecast patterns suggest enhanced warming over land, especially northern parts of Europe, Asia and North America - extending the ongoing trend.\"The forecast also suggests current relatively cool conditions in the north Atlantic are predicted to warm, potentially exacerbating warming over Europe.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nafc pair shortlisted in national lantra finals ","story":"Valentina Romano and Jimmy Dakin are in the running for the Lantra Scotland awards.Jimmy Dakin from Sanday in Orkney has been shortlisted as Aquaculture Learner of the Year.

All can be done by looking at a computer screen.Any body with any sense knows there is no requirement to look in the sky, or on the runway or at the weather to see for yourself what is going on.If HIAL are determined to go ahead with this, perhaps there should be a #trial# period, of say at least a minimum of one year.Instead of just installing all the cameras and whatever other gubbins is supposed to make this work, feeding it down the phone line and hoping for the best. Why not pull down the blinds in the tower here and give the local controllers the same monitor screens to look at as they#re intending to use remotely to operate from instead. Meanwhile, also send the data to Inverness, and have them monitor and log on how many occasions and for what duration the data received is either interrupted or of inadequate quality.If the system is as resilient as HIAL claim, they have nothing to worry about or hide, the local controllers will have no complaints about using monitors instead of looking out the window, there will have been no data interruptions to Inverness, and any deterioration in data quality will have been minimal. However,serious shortcomings are evident, a controller only needs to raise the blind to regain actual vision and immediately rescue a situation.Bosses say their communications system has been affected, and that engineers are on the scene working to remedy the situation.# Well, that#s OK then.

No film-maker has documented UK society as forensically as Ken Loach. The desperation that comes from poverty, the bad choices that often seem like the only choices available, are his stock-in-trade. ‘Sorry We Missed You’ is another compelling exemplar of what the man is all about.Marriedparents Ricky and Abbie did all the right things. They followed the rules andworked hard and were on the brink of becoming homeowners when the Northern Rockbuilding society collapsed, taking their dreams with it. Now mired in debt, theyare shunted from one shabby rental to another along with surly son Seb andsmart daughter Liza Jane.Ricky’sskills are no longer in demand. Even though he is a “grafter” who has doneevery job under the sun, proper jobs – with set hours, agreeable conditions, anda decent wage – are like hen’s teeth. So he takes a punt, persuades his we tosell her car, and buys a nearly-new van. them. He doesn’t get a wage – he chargesfees. He is a self-employed knight of the road, free to make as much money ashis speed around Newcastle will allow.Theillusion is soon shattered. His boss at the depot is a bullet-headed bruiserwith all the empathy of a shark. That’s because he himself is trapped in jungleof competition with other depots.

He is in thehot seat this week, speaking to us about his love of music and choosing his top ten tracks - not an easy task by any means.Vincent enjoys a busy family le AND has five children and five grandchildren.He is a finance and property expert, and in his spare time helps out as a quiz master, which keeps him sharp!However music has always been a big part of his le, and he has had an interest in it since he was only a boy.“Music is a passion and something that has followed me since childhood,” explained Vincent.He confesses that his top  favourite songs are constantly changing, so when revealing his list, he decided to focus on a top  that brings back the strongest memories for him throughout his le.At number one is the Beach Boys with ‘God Only knows’.“This was released in  off the incredible Pet Sounds album. “Although I didn’t discover it until my teens, this is an enduring song of beauty.” Number two on his list is ‘The Long and Winding Road’ from The Beatles.He said: “It’s impossible not to have a Beatles track in here. This is just before my time but this song from the  ‘Let it Be’ album is my pick from many contenders.Number three is Love Affair – Everlasting Love. “This is my earliest memory from the  pop classic. “The remake of a ‘ hit for Robert Knight sung by the wonderful Steve Ellis.” The number four spot is reserved for ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’.“Coming up to its th anniversary, my constant favourite song of all time by Simon and Garfunkelis Bridge Over Troubled Waters.” Number five goes to Sam Cooke with ‘Bring it On Home to Me’“What top  couldn’t contain this amazing singer and composer who contributed to the success of Aretha, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Al Green.” Number six belongs to a Pink Floyd classic.“Probably in the mid ’s my favourite group was Pink Floyd. It was during this period that I began to collect albums.“Dark Side Of The Moon being my first Floyd purchase, however my pick is ‘Wish You Were Here’ off their ‘ album of the same name.”Seventh spot goes to The Eagles. “Sticking my mid ’s periodof music and my infatuation with The Eagles.“I rather quickly acquired their early albums ‘Desperado On The Border One Of These Nights’, however my selection is ‘The Last Resort’ off their th studio album Hotel Calornia.” For eighth spot, Vincent stays with The Eagles.“I’m still in my teenage years and sticking with the Eagles theme, although I’ve moved sideways to select an album I listened to nightly for a couple of years from Jackson Browne.“It was his fourth album and I’ve picked the title track, which is the wonderful ‘The Pretender’. As the list draws to a close, Vincent says: “Running out of room as I juggle with The Four Tops, The Jam, Steely Dan, Stevie, Wonder, Elvis Costello, Al Green, Spencer Davis, The Rolling Stones, George Harrison and OMD.“But I have to stick with my memory theme and at number nine I’ve gone with ‘Supertramp’ which I overplayed at university.“Mainly Crime Of The Century and Breakfast In America and Crisis What Crisis.“My selection is from the latter album and I’ve gone for A Soap Box Opera, it’s orchestral feel just does it to me.”For the last place on his top ten list, Vincent has included a track from the legendary Bruce Springsteen.“I needed Bruce Springsteen in here.“Although how do I pick just one track  Born To Run, The River Nebraska, Born In The USA, The Rising “Again sticking with nostalgia and being a romantic I’ve picked the  ‘Dancing In The Dark’ because it was the year I married Catherine and she’s had to put up with my music ever since!”It’s often hard to think of your favourite  tracks! Vincent admits these “are not necessarily my favourite ever songs as the list changes constantly, but they certainly contain my strongest and fondest memories from down through the years.

While he still enjoys the banter over the counter on a daily basis, hes made himself a local social media personality with his popular posts ranging from the daily headlines to his chatter sparking reminiscences about the confectionery of yesteryear. Editor Des Blackadder sat down with Eugene this week to hear just some of the stories he has to tell after four decades in his Broughshane Street shop.You could say that Eugene Diamond got his start in the newspaper industry and hes been associated with it for most of his adult le.Born in the late s in a long demolished row of mill workers cottages in James Street in Harryville, Eugene is one of nine children - three girls and six boys. Which must have been a tight fit in the James Street days.I was a baby when the family got a move to the houses in the Demesne Estate, just across the Braid River from Harryville. If you ask me I would say it was perfect place to grow up .. we had the ruins of a castle literally at the top of our estate and a forest pretty much on our doorstep!The neighbours were great people and there were lots of children growing up in the Demesne at the time. We used to have great fun making huts up in the woods - which we called the forest - just beside the old Intermediate School site. One of my best memories is making a hut under the pedestrian bridge over the Braid which led to the Ballykeel One estate - we could hear the people walking across above our heads and we thought we were some boys because they didnt know we were there! Innocent days indeed, laughs Eugene.There was no easy pocket money in those days so Eugene had to earn his by delivering newspapers around the sprawling Ballykeel Two estate which had been constructed in the late s.That was my first job in the newspaper business, recalls Eugene. I got the job with the late Tam Johnston who had premises at what used to be known as the Ballykeel One shops. He was a gentleman and his shop will be well remembered by the older generation around Ballykeel and Harryville.Having attended St Patricks High School, Eugenes first real job took him to the Murphys Bottling Plant which was sited just off Railway Street in Harryville.Always on the look out for an extra few quid, Eugene took on a weekend job serving in a clothes shop in the centre of Ballymena.That was me into the retail sector - and it was a great time to be in the clothing trade. A guy called Brian Close owned the shop which was called In-Gear. It was just at the corner of Bryan Street and Church Street - the same building occupied until recently by David Bellingham.Things went well and he offered me the post of manager so I left Murphys for good.It was an era of glam rock, outrageous stars and some outright fashion disasters.Top of the Pops more or less set the style. When the Bay City Rollers hit the heights their tartan striped half mast trousers and skinny college style jumpers were huge sellers especially with the girls.Most guys round Ballymena were pretty much content with a pair of jeans, a gingham shirt and a Shetland wool jumper. Younger lads wore a lot of Wrangler denim known locally as the Wrangler suit of jacket and skinner half mast jeans.I remember the night that David Essex appeared on Top of the Pops wearing a grandad shirt - the next day there was a huge demand for the style, we couldnt get enough of them!Bryan Ferry more or less brought the elegant suit back into fashion when he and Roxy Music made a comeback just after the punk era had faded. Guys all wanted the double-breasted suit with turn-up trousers at the time, he recalls.Eugene chuckles when I ask him about the fashion disasters he encountered.I sold an awful lot of velvet jackets at a time, he recalls. Black, blue, bottle green. They were very popular but I bet the guys who bought them wonder why when they look back.Then there was the parallel suit - I can remember the favourite colour was electric blue. Basically it was a sports coat worn with matching extra width trousers. You could have sailed the Atlantic with themyoud nailed them to a mast!But denim was, without doubt, the major seller in Ballymena and a controversial advert for one particular brand meant that Eugene found himself in the eye of a publicity storm which made headlines far and wide.In those days dferent shops were linked to a certain brand - for example Sam of Sams Boutique had what was effectively the Wrangler dealershipI remember. Edwin Maternaghan was another big name in fashion retailing locally and he had Brutus.By now the name of In-Gear had been changed to Bananas Boutique and we were selling Easy Jeans and a new product called Jesus Jeans.They had a full colour poster of a well-proportioned lady squeezed into a pair of Jesus Jeans with the slogan He who loves me, follows me. We put it up in the window and it was a marmite job - people either loved it or hated it! One religious group based out in the country started a petition about it so we started a counter petition in the shop.It was the time when Ballymena couldnt appear in a news story without the words Bible Belt being added on - around the same time you had the ELO showgrounds story making headlines too.While Eugene enjoyed the fun times at Bananas, he can well remember one of Ballymenas worst days of devastation during the troubles when Church Street was blown to smithereens by an IRA bomb.It was on Friday, May ,  and I remember I was chatting to a friend outside the shop when a police car raced up and an officer told us to clear the area because there was a bomb in a post office van parked in the street. I had got round to Wellington Street and was talking to my good friend journalist Lyle McMullan.I said to him theres a story for you and because there were so many bomb hoaxes in those days he replied onlyit goes off.With that the lower end of Church Street just lted. Ive never felt or seen anything like it before or since. It was a scene of utter devastation which people who lived through it will never forget. One of my vivid memories is how dficult it was to get re-opened - the shop had very distinctive rounded windows and it took a long time to get new glass  made by Pilkingtons. And of course a lot of people will remember the bomb damage sales which took place in the aftermath.When Bananas closed its doors in , Eugene reckoned it was time for a change of direction and when he came across a small shop for rent in Upper Broughshane Street he decided to take the plunge. It was called the First and last because it was the first shop on the way into town and, coversely, the last as you were going out!I had started off delivering papers as a wee boy and now I found myself in behind the counter of a paper shop, he said.”My first rent payment was pound a week.”Forty years later hes still loving the job - despite a horrying early .am start!Sure its only seven days a week, laughs Eugene.In those  years, Eugene has witnessed the high points of the newspaper market when titles like News of the World sold by the barrow load.You couldnt explain to todays generation just how huge the NOTW actually was. People might have bought the quality Sundays but they also bought the NOTW eventhey did tuck it inside the Sunday Times! Of course they were caught out in some abysmal practices and that cant be forgiven but they did break some enormously important stories too. I still have some NOTW publicity material on a side wall of the shop. It may well be the last such material still on display in Britain but I keep it there to remind of just how big the newspaper print industry was at the time.But selling papers was only part of Eugenes role and he was a past master at stirring up some publicity out of all proportion to the size of his tiny shop.Back in the early s I took a punt on getting my own Ballymena Rock made up by a firm in Newry. People thought I had lost the plot because everyone associated rock with seaside resorts and not a town like Ballymena. Thankfully local people loved the idea and I had a great sale on it. Quite a few bars were sent overseas too, he laughs.The ieties of sweets and chocolate bars Eugene has sold down through the years is staggering.In fact, Ive come to the conclusion that people here have the sweetest tooth in the world! If you want to start a debate in Ballymena all you have to do is ask someone what their favourite sweet of all time was.Im a diabetic so I dont do many sweets but I have a good knowledge of wnhat the public wants and to this day people will travel from all over the country to buy a certain brand of toffee or an old style boiled sweet which I stock. Sweets especially are memory jerkers and they have tremendous nostalgia value. If it gets people talking and laughing sure its a good thing. How many times have I heard stories about someone losing a filling to the old Rileys Toffee Rolls  And yet they still came back for more!And does he have a personal favourite Cinnamon Lozenges all the way, he says. As far as I know they are more or less an Irish-only sweet because people come in all the time and take away a few bags full to friends and family in other parts of the world.Talking about local flavours, Eugene says he still has regulars who come specically for the bottled minerals.You would not believe the number of people who still swear by Kali water! And the younger generation will have absolutely no idea wnat Kali Water is but older people will probably be remembering the day they took a drink of it by mistake.If digital technology is our pathway to the future then it is a time machine which works both ways and Eugenes nostalgia posts about old sweets on social media have been delighting the local public for the past few years.As one who was steeped in newspapers I was a latecomer to twitter and facebook but time waits for no man so I decided to embrace it. To be honest Ive had some great fun thanks to social media. People love the old pictures of products and just love to tell you their stories of why they loved a particular brand more than others, says Eugene.The recognition by the National Lottery reflects sales which have raised more than pound. million for good causes down through the years. As one of the last old style newsagents the award is well deserved and theextends its best wishes to Eugene as he embarks on his st year in the trade.

If you go somewhere that’s already been documented it takes the excitement out of it.”Most of the properties are in a bad state of repairHe said: “What I do I call it documenting. I go in take pictures and write a wee blurb about the place I’ve been. “Sometimes it’s a property that’s got a ‘for sale’ sign at it. You’ll come back in three months and it’s gone, it’s been flattened for redevelopment. It’s sad because when you’re in it you get a real sense of the character of the house, the essence of it.”Michael said he used to have a penchant for ghost hunting, but with his new pursuit he tries to steer clear of the paranormal: “I used to have a bit of a fascination with paranormal investigation, though I think it had more to do with the old buildings. I love walking round old places as you can pick up so much of the history from just walking around. “I used to do a few paranormal investigations so that gave me an appreciation of old buildings, the character of them, just how dferent they are to the ones now.“With Forgotten Places NI I don’t like to spook things up to be scarier than they are. That said, there’s a post I put up just this weekend about a house that I called the House of Ambivilence. It really did have mixed feeling about it. “It looked lovely from the outside, a nice farmhouse. Downstairs had a nice calm atmosphere, but when you went upstairs, honestly, you wanted to get out again, something just didn’t sit. I felt uneasy about the atmosphere. A well lived in room“That’s not generally the case, mostly you get a good feeling about the place because of the items you find in them – kids’ toys, religious pictures, birthday cards. It’s that connection I like.”Michael’s photos are largely focused on derelict properties in NI but he has also ventured into the Republic of Ireland: “Banbridge is a good location to have as a base. I can be in the south in  minutes, quicker than to get to Belfast.“For me it’s trying to find places that haven’t been documented. Everybody’s done Cairndhuand because of its popularity it has been subject to vandalism. Nevertheless it’s a fascinating place. It doesn’t matter what people do to it.” Michael, who has three children, said: “My daughter would come out with me from time to time for a wee spin. We’d trek up country roads to seewe can find any or maybe I’ll have some place marked to check out. “I’ll maybe read around online about an area to seethere’s any stories relating to old mills, old schools. You can look at satellite images before you go. We’ll maybe have eight or  places marked.“These places that I’m going into, people don’t even know they’re out there. There’s hundreds of them. I mark them on my Google Maps – there’s five or six hundred on there to explore.”Michael said he has a bank of photos stored on his phone that he hasn’t shared yet: “If I didn’t go out for another three months I’d have enough to keep posting. “Looking back at some of my older photos, they aren’t great. I think I’ve got better. “In July or August I had , likes on the page, by December it had doubled, now I’m pushing towards ,. “It’s amazing because I’m not doing anything with it, I’m just publishing photos with a small bit of a story, I’m not promoting it or trying to make money from it.”Michael is quick to point out that he is not the first person to find beauty in the Province’s derelict properties. He said Abandonned NI set the benchmark for this sort of photography.Michael said his obsession was a year-round one: “I’ll be out in winter as well as summer. In winter it’s good because the foilage dies back and you’re able to see things that would previously have been hidden. I remember once crawling through a hole and the hedge to find this property that you’d never know was there.” Asked what led him to begin searching for old houses Michael said: “It was my son who got me started, it must have been about three or four years ago. “He showed me this video on YouTube of a guy in America who was exploring this derelict mansion that used to belong to a drug dealer. “It looked fantastic, all the broken windows and doors hanging off and the stuff that was left inside. “My son said we should try to find something like that here. I said, ‘you’re not going to get something on that scale but we’ll have a look’. “What we did was we went to Cairndhu which is near Larne. It’s pretty much where everybody that does this starts. It’s so well known, it’s such a tragic story of how it fell into such disrepair. It’s so vast. As soon as I got in I was hooked.”Cairndhu which was built around  is the former home of Sir Thomas Dixon. It became a convalescent home before it was closed in .Michael said: “There are people on social media who tell me about a derelict house near to them, sometimes it can be just a shell. For me that’s not that interesting. “What I find interesting is somewhere that has personal possessions still inside. It could be furniture, it could be letters, there’s houses you go into and you’d think people had just walked out and left everything still in it.Michael said his passion was driven more by what people had left behind inside the properties rather than the buildings themselves.He commented: “Some people would look at a man in his forties out exploring the country like this as stupid, but for me it’s just that sense of adventure. “It’s good to be out and about. It’s a healthy interest and no one is harmed.“It’s like how you feel when you’re a kid when you go out exploring. “I’m not sure I was even this adventurous as a kid. Maybe I’m making up for it now.“It’s that excitement of the unknown, that danger of not knowing what you’re going to find. That’s why I do it. “It’s those wee unassuming houses that look like nothing and you go in and they’re just filled with stuff. You find out all about the owners, the le that they led.”Discussing some of the remnants of the past he has uncovered, Michael said: “You see so many of the old Singer sewing machines.“There was one house where I found the shell of a Mk II Jag. I found an old ambulance as well.“For me the best finds are the wee personal things like a Valentine’s card or a kid’s note that says ‘mummy has been mean to me and daddy’ – you’re hoping that was just a wee fleeting moment.”He continued: “I try to capture those items as they sit to tell the story of the house. “I take the photos on my phone, maybe I’ll upgrade to a fancy camera someday though photographers will tell you it doesn’t matter what you use, it’s your eye for a photo.“People say to me they can imagine a story around my posts. In my wee blurb I’ll not give the location away unless it’s a well known building. I’ll just describe it a wee bit as best I can and let the pictures tell the story.”Offering suggestions as to why houses end up derelict yet full of possessions, he said: “A lot of the time you’ll get an elderly person who will pass away, they may have nobody to leave it to or they may leave it to the family and they can’t agree what to do with it so it just sits.“Sometimes you get people who buy the property for the adjoining land but don’t knock down the original property.”Some of the items left behindThe scene in an abandonned kitchenBoots no longer made for walkingThis cupboard remains well stockedAn Evening Prayer"},{"url":null,"title":"new ulster hockey kirk cup sponsorship deal to help raise funds for ni children s hospice","story":"Ahead of the final, NI Law Firm of the Year, Millar McCall Wylie, has announced a sponsorship deal with Ulster Hockey to back the competition through to the end of .Chief Operating Officer, Christopher McCandless said: ldquoWe are thrilled to be sponsoring the Kirk Cup, both this season and next.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"janines wedding day is captured on camera","story":"WELL-known local woman Janine Howard will feature in tonight#s edition of the popular BBCNI documentary series, True North.‘Saving Face’ follows the story of -year-old Janine and her preparations for her marriage to fiancé Matthew Light in October.Janine was just two years old when she was diagnosed with leukaemia.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"register now for the craic 10k st","story":"BELFAST’S First Citizen was onhand to officially launch the annual SPAR Craic K.Set to kick-start St Patrick’s Day celebrations on March , thousands of runners are set to take part in the urban run which is celebrating its sixth year.Lord Mayor Danny Baker told the Andersonstown News that he will counting down the race as runners go through their paces.“I will be starting the race and as much as I would love to take part I have a sore knee at the minute and that’s my excuse,” he laughed. “This is a huge event for the city and I’m delighted that a portion of the funds raised will go towards Marie Curie cancer charity.

The results found that % of all gluten-free snack products were high in fat and % were high in sugar, with calorie levels similar to a standard chocolate bar.An Eat Natural Protein Packed Crunchy Nut Bar with peanuts and chocolate , which costs p, contains  calories and .g fat per g, for example, while a Meridian Peanut and Cocoa bar , costing £., has  calories and .g fat per g. By contrast, a Snickers bar , priced around p in a supermarket, contains  calories and g fat per g.Industry estimates suggest that the gluten-free food market in the UK was worth £ million in , up % on the previous year. Gluten-free food products are promoted by media personalities and sports stars as part of a trend for clean label, including free-from, food products.Ms Da Silva said gluten-free food, like high-protein food, is currently on trend and therefore \"big business\". \"In the case of gluten-free snacks, you could end up purchasing snack foods with lots of added fat and sugar which are of no added benefit to your health,\" she added."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/6954a/38907831.ece/BINARY/Yvonne.jpg","title":"coronavirus wuhan like ghost city its a relief to get out says northern ireland lecturer","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

What do those names mean to you minister ”Mr Murphy said the RHI episode was a “crisis” and in crisis situations all parties pull in a range of party figures to help co-ordinate the response.“That involves people who manage,” he said. “Now some people may draft in other people who are elected representatives, most parties have chief executives, they have people on their executive committees who aren’t elected representatives and you involve people who can manage negotiations as we have managed negotiations since the early s.”He added: “A party management team manages in the middle of a crisis and all of the inidual members of that team try to co-ordinate their activities.“That’s how we do business andthere was a crisis here tomorrow morning I don’t doubt we would draft in a team to try to manage our response to it, which would involve a range of people including elected and non-elected representatives.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  TUV leader Jim Allister claimed the appointment process for special advisers had been ‘watered down’ During his appearance before the committee Mr Murphy revealed that the Assembly budget would be struck before the Chancellor announced his budget on March .He said any additional money flowing to Northern Ireland as a result of Sajid Javid’s budget would then be factored into Stormont’s spending plans.The Finance Minister also reiterated his claim that the UK Government had failed to honour undertakings to finance the New Decade, New Approach powersharing deal.He said only £ million of the £ billion package announced by the Government was new money.He said £ billion was already pledged to the region as part of UK-wide spending commitments and £ million was previously contained in the  confidence and supply deal between the Conservatives and DUP.Mr Murphy said the £ million, which will be spread over five years, was well below what had been discussed during the negotiations ahead of the deal being published.“Those commitments that were given in that document weren’t a Santa Claus wish list,” he said.“They were carefully worked out through a series of discussions between all of the parties, senior officials from the department of finance, the head of the civil service hereand senior officials from the Northern Ireland Office.”Mr Murphy said his officials were continuing to engage with Treasury officials with the aim of securing more funds.The minister expressed frustration that the executive had to hand back £ million to the Treasury ahead of the next financial year at the same time as they were asked for more funding.But he pointed out that the £ million of unused Financial Transactions Capital could not have been erted to the powersharing deal.He said the FTC money could only be accessed in very specic circumstances – namely in the form of a loan to, or equity investment in, a capital project delivered by a private sector organisation.Mr Sterling, who appeared before the Executive Office Committee on Wednesday, was asked whether he expected the Government to provide more money.“You will know the Finance Minister had meetings in London last week, I think he was quite positive about how they went,” he told the committee.“It’s a matter of record that the Department of Finance is doing further work to identy the cost of the ious commitments, the challenges that are facing us and to go back to Treasury with a strong case for additional resources. I wouldn’t want to make a judgment on the likelihood of that leading to signicantly more money but I hope it will.”At the finance committee, TUV leader Jim Allister claimed a revised code for special advisers had “watered down” the appointment process by removing an obligation on ministers to canvas a pool of candidates and outline the reasoning for their choice.“Do you think that’s meeting the expectations of the public in terms of transparency ” he said.Mr Murphy said the priority was strengthening the code in respect of how special advisers operated when in post, not how they are appointed.“The question is are we more concerned with how they get there or what they do when they are there,” said the minister."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Lancaster, is hoping to leave Wuhan, told the PA news agency the current situation was that a flight may leave on Friday.“We are still in the flat,” he said.“We are more positive that the Government are actually doing something now and they are communicating with us better than before.“The situation is basically we won’t go to the airport until we receive the confirmation email.“Nobody has actually received an official email to say whether we are on the flight or not and what time it will be leaving, so will be still in their apartments waiting for that email.“They said that it’s probably more likely going to be tomorrow morning now, but again you know that could change.“The information is changing hour by hour so we will just have to see.”Jeff Siddle, from Northumberland, told the BBC his family faced a “terrible dilemma” after he and his nine-year-old daughter were told they could fly back – but not his Chinese we, who has a permanent residency visa for the UK.He said the flight had been put back to “provisionally” Friday but he had not been given an exact time.Passengers say they have been told only to take hand luggage on the flight.Meanwhile, the World Health Organisationemergency committee is expected to meet on Thursday to decide whether to declare an international public health emergency.The WHO said the “whole world needs to be on alert” over the new coronavirus outbreak.Its emergency committee said last week it was “too early” to pronounce a global health emergency.Dr Michael Ryan, executive director at the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, said the decision to reconvene was due to the increasing number of cases and evidence of person-to-person transmission of the virus.He told a press conference in Geneva that the Chinese government deserves “huge credit” for its response and transparency regarding the “extraordinary challenge”.The whole world needs to be on alert now, the whole world needs to take action and be ready for any cases that comeWHOHe said: “The whole world needs to be on alert now, the whole world needs to take action and be ready for any cases that come, either from the original epicentre or from other epicentres that become established.”The number of cases has jumped to ,, surpassing the , people diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndromeduring the - outbreak.The death toll, which has risen to , is currently lower than the  people who died in China from Sars.The first cases in the Middle East have been confirmed as a family-of-four from Wuhan that was visiting the United Arab Emirates.Four cases have been confirmed in Germany, making it the second European country to report cases after France.In Australia, officials unveiled plans to evacuate its nationals from Wuhan and Hubei province, with plans to quarantine them in the Christmas Island immigration detention centre.To date, about % of the nearly , cases are in China.Dr Ryan estimated the death rate of the new virus at %, but said the figure was very preliminary.We are working hard to get British nationals back from Wuhan. Public safety is the top priority. Anyone who s from Wuhan will be safely isolated for  days, with all neccessary medical attention.— Matt HancockJanuary , The WHO has said around one in five cases of coronavirus are leading to severe disease.Scientists say there are still many questions to be answered about coronavirus, including how easily it spreads and how severe it is.A Downing Street source said it was expecting about  British nationals to be ed from Wuhan and they had agreed to be placed in “assisted isolation”.It came after the Foreign Office updated its advice on Tuesday to warn against all but essential travel to mainland China, saying it may become more dficult for British nationals in other provinces to leave.British Airways has extended its suspension of all flights to and from mainland China until Monday.The airline said it will “continually review our schedule according to advice from the authorities”.Virgin Atlantic flights between Heathrow and Shanghai are continuing to operate as scheduled.Meanwhile, the World Athletics Indoor Championships in Nanjing, China, have been postponed until March  due to the outbreak, World Athletics has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"from nine mentions a year to 9000 how mps caught the","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They continue to surprise me.”The tunnel exposes limitations of President Donald Trump’s border wall, which stretches several feet underground in the area and is considered effective against small, crudely built tunnels often called “gopher holes”.The tunnel announced on Wednesday was found about  feet underground, well below the wall.Following the tunnel’s discovery in August, Mexican law enforcement identied the entrance and US investigators mapped the tunnel, which extends a total of , feet. The next longest tunnel in the US, discovered in San Diego in , was , feet long.The newly discovered tunnel is about five-and-a-half feet tall, two feet wide, and runs at an average depth of  feet below the surface, officials said.Agents discovered several hundred sandbags blocking a suspected former exit of the tunnel in a San Diego industrial warehouse area.The tunnel went under several warehouses in the district, where sophisticated tunnels have often ended, and extended into open fields.LeNoir, a veteran on the multiagency task force of tunnel investigators known as “tunnel rats”, said he made his way through about  feet of sandbags blocking the tunnel but could not go any further.An incomplete offshoot of the tunnel that extended , feet suggested to authorities that smugglers had plugged an initial exit point and were building another.The suspected previous exit “became unsustainable for whatever reason, so they built a spur,” Border Patrol spokesman Jeff Stephenson said.By federal law, US authorities must fill the American side of tunnels with concrete after they are discovered."},{"url":null,"title":"511843","story":"After receiving their transfer tests today, hundreds of young people and their parents will be making the decision as to which school they want to go to.To help them, Derry Now has collated information on all the grammar schools in County Derry.The information includes how many applications the schools received last year, how many applications were approved and the scores or grades the schools used to admit pupils.

So I’m writing this article, for a few reasons, the first to say please do keep your child off nursery they aren’t well, it’s no fun for them and no fun for anyone  when they get the bug too. I know le can be hard with a sickly child, I know how much we need that break sometimes but please, please keep your bugs at home. googletag.cmd.push My next reason is to share with you some tips, ideas and thoughts that I’ve heard and used over the years to help with coughs, cold’s and sneezes, please do remember though I am not a doctor soyou decide to use one of these ideas that I’m passing along to you then do check with a pharmacist or doctor that is is okay to do this with your baby, toddler and  or child. . DO make your child wear a vest or t-shirt under their jumper. Believe me I have met a few children this winter who just wear t-shirts, and always look and feel cold, winter clothes are for winter and summer clothes for summe.!  . TEACH your toddler how to blow through their nose, yes literally show them how to blow, this makes runny noses so much easier to manage. Yes of course you have to hold the tissue for them, butthey can blow then that means less of the runny stuff.  . DO put a little vaseline around their noses when your little one has a cold - this stops their nose getting sore, but also makes it sooo much easier to wipe. . Do keep this little pot of vaseline just for their nose though. . TREAT, some people do use medicines, paracetamol, baby Sudafed etc and this is a personal choice, it’s up to you as parents. But as my mum said, ‘with medicine the cold will be there a week, without medicine it’ll be there for a week’. The medicines are designed to make your little one feel better, they won’t necessarily cure the cold. Remember you know your child best, whether this be they need a little something, or an appointment at the doctor.  . WHEN your little one goes to nursery do pack a spare outfit including socks, shoes or wellies and trousers - not for toilet accidents but because it is till nice to play outside but it can be wet or muddy and it is not nice to sit about later in damp clothes.  . HELP your two and three year olds learn how to blow their nose AND put the tissue in the bin not back in the box- it is a skill and does need practise but the sooner they learn the more comfortable they feel. . TEMPERATURE, a normal temperature in babies and children is about .C but this can y slightly. A fever is usually considered to be a temperatureof C or above’ . It is handy to have a thermometer at home for these worrying times - do ask for advice from a pharmacist about which is best to buy and easiest to use. But always be mindful of your little one’s temperaturethey are poorly - and especially mindful with babies.  . PLEASE don’t wipe their nose with kitchen roll - this can make it sore, use tissues with balm in them - yes I know they can be more expensive but bargain shops do great deals.Be careful wiping noses with wet wipes as some can sting - soft tissues and vaseline don’t! . EXTRA, sometimes people use a vapour, like Vicks, to rub onto their baby, toddler or child’s chest, or feet, these can be soothing when applied to the body but you can also get them as a humidier, or as an oil to pop in the bath - it’s up to you to choose what is right for your little one. Please do be aware that there are age restrictions on them and not all are suitable for all ages.  . DO make your child wear a coat and a hat for very cold weather and maybea scarf and glovesit’s very chilly.  . DON’T force your child to eat too muchthey are poorly, little and often is best, snotty noses can often lead to sickly tummy’s, but do make sure they are getting plenty of fluids so they do not become dehydrated, water, water and more water or failing that juice. . . EVEN though it’s cold outside and your little may be full of cold sometimes a walk in the fresh air for a short time can help - fresh air can make you feel better and help your little one sleep better too - just remember to wrap up warm.  . DO encourage your little one to eat lots of vegetables and fruit, all the time not just when they have a cold, these are full of vitamins that will help them to develop a good immune system. Fingers crossed these few little things help, good luck fighting the cold bug. Atishooooo!

Speaking ahead of next week’s Apprenticeship Week at the North West Regional College , Brendan Duddy said he chose an apprenticeship, knowing he would be guaranteed employment, during, and at the end of course. Brendan, , from Bishop Street, enrolled for an apprenticeship at NWRC after he completed his A-Levels at St Joseph’s Boys School.He explained: “I knew % that I wanted to get a trade. At University I could spend years of my le studying to work in an oversubscribed area, so when I saw the apprenticeship opportunity with NWRC and Errigal Contracts, I knew it was for me.”The joint enterprise between NWRC and Errigal was launched in , offering two-year apprenticeship opportunities in a number of skills areas. During the two-year programme, students are given the skills in college to achieve a City and Guilds Award work with top professionals on jobs across the UK and Ireland, all while earning top apprenticeships wages.Brendan, who won the gold medal in dry-lining at the Live UK Worlds Skills Finals in Birmingham and will now go on to represent the UK at the  world finals in Shanghai, said his apprenticeship had given him the opportunity to work all around the UK, in Manchester, Liverpool, and Belfast, learning his trade.He’s now looking forward to the Skills Olympics next year when he’ll go head-to-head with the world’s best. The competition in Birmingham was tough,” he said. “As you work you are aware of the thousands of people who are looking at you. “When I won gold I was shocked and I’m delighted to now be going on to compete in Shanghai.“I’ve really enjoyed the opportunities that studying with NWRC and working with Errigal has given me and I’d encourage more young people my age to give it a go. I’m now working full time with Errigal and it’s been great.”From, - February, a series of events are being held across the Derry City and Strabane District Council area promoting the opportunities available for apprentices locally.North West Regional College will host two events to celebrate Apprenticeship Week.The Construction Futures event will be held at the Student Zone at Strand Road campus on Tuesday, February  from - p.m. An information evening on Higher Level Apprenticeships , will be held at the Strand Road campus the following nightat .pm.

A city that shows fantastic community spirit. The night of  December was no dferent. That was the night a group of local artists decided to give something back and did so by way of a “site specic performance” of a new drama performed on the Guildhall steps to an overwhelming audience of support. Brief Synopsis: Closed Shutters is a tragic comedy full with social commentary, spoken in a Derry voice but has a global resonance. It is a story of three homeless alcoholics, set at the mouth of Christmas and takes place over  hours in their lives.The creative decision was made to perform the piece outside, as the team wanted the story to resonate with the audience. Let them feel the cold. This is what is faced by many people on our streets nightly.  Preparations began in September, with the assembly of the creative team and rehearsals. From the very beginning, everyone involved in the production made a collective decision to waive any fees.

In the lead up to the event, as word started to spread about what was happening, the donations began… and they didn’t stop.The team reached out to the North West Methodist Mission first and were delighted when they agreed to come on board and help out, donating pound worth of brand new sleeping bags, all to be distributed to the homeless. As well as this, they provided all of the props needed and transport on the day. By way of a thank you for their kindness, North West Methodist Mission then received  bags of cold weather gear, as well as bags of food, toys and blankets. All of which went straight to those in need. A gofundme page raised pound which, in turn, was given to the North West Methodist Mission, to repay the investment they had made in the project, plus some extra. On the day of the performance, volunteers gathered around the city centre with collection buckets, while others gathered bags of cold weather items in the Guildhall. The total raised on the night was pound, which was then split between and recently presented to two local charities who do great work within the city - Derry Well Woman and Foyle Food Bank receiving pound.

More information will follow on when and how these two new lts will be operational but I expect that to be possible within the next few days.Cars or light vehicles which are five years old or more are eligible for a temporary exemption certicate, which will extend a vehicles MOT certicate by four months.However, four-year-old cars have never been tested and are, therefore, not eligible for the exemption.“I have instructed the DVA that they are to be focussed on testing taxis and four-year-old cars for private customers and also car dealerships in the first instance, said Mrs Mallon.I have also instructed the DVA to speak with the Federation for Small Businesses to ensure clear communication is being delivered. I have already ensured that all other customers can be covered by the issue of temporary exemption certicates.“My Department is not responsible for the clamping of vehicles, that is the DVLA. However, the DVA has communicated to the DVLA that customers unable to tax their vehicles due to this disruption should not be penalised.“I will continue to push the DVA for progress on increasing the capacity for testing, whilst ensuring that safety remains the top priority for customers and staff.”Meanwhile, Derry MLA Raymond McCartney suggested four-year-old cars could be given a one year extension to alleviatewaiting times.“Sinn Feacutein have raised the possibility of providing a one year extension on the requirement for four-year-old cars to get tested.This would free up testing lanes for taxis.“I welcome the independent investigation ordered by the Minister for Infrastructure to examine how this situation arose.“We need to get to the bottom of these problems to address the health and safety concerns of workers and drivers alike. The Minister also needs to directly address the capacity issues plaguing the DVA.“This should include exploring a similar testing regime used in the south for private cars between four and -years-old which are tested every two years - as opposed to yearly.“This could alleviate a lot of serious pressures on MOT centres. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This can help tackle both the obesity epidemic and improve childrenrsquos overall health and well-being.The Active School Travelprogramme which Sustrans delivers has successfully increased the number of pupils walking, cycling and scooting to school, with the charity explaining that it takes on  new schools each year.However, it says the programme needs to expand and provide more long-term support to school communities in order to turn around these statistics.In the   period, the number of children walking, cycling and scooting to school in the AST programme increased from % to % while, at the same time, the number of pupils being driven to school fell from % to %.Cllr Walker says he is ldquoall for getting more children to walk to school, but explained that in some parts of Down District, this simply isnrsquot possible as in many rural areas there are no footpaths. In addition, he said there are no dedicated cycle paths.ldquoI fully support the work of Sustrans and have worked with the charity on a number of schemes in my own area, he revealed.ldquoI recognise that the more children who walk to school, the less congestion there will be and fewer cars sitting in traffic queues pumping dangerous fumes into the atmosphere.Cllr Walker said mph zones have been introduced outside some local schools, calling for such schemes to be rolled out across all council areas.He added: ldquoWith the emphasis now on people taking more responsibility for their own health and getting fitter, encouraging children to walk to school when it is safe to do so will sew the seed of keeping healthy from an early age and this will stay with them for the rest of their lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Delay.jpg","title":"Delay for development meeting on Irish Street  ","story":"AN event designed to provide business owners in Downpatrick with an input into plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings has been delayed.Originally scheduled to take place before Christmas the meeting was delayed in the wake of the snap Westminster election, with hopes that it would go ahead this month.Now it has emerged that it could be February or March before what is being viewed as one of the most signicant town centre regeneration meetings ever to take place in the district takes place.A number of Downpatrick councillors were recently given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear which will feature heavily in the proposed redevelopment scheme.The old police base enjoys protected status and therefore cannot be razed to the ground to pave the way for any new development. As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials have this week reaffirmed their commitment to work with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site, with the project being spearheaded by the Department of Communities.Council officials say that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what local people would like to see and what would work at this particular site.Officials insist that there is little point developing options which they think might work, with the forthcoming meeting with all stakeholders designed to secure by-in from them and develop a project that is likely to succeed.The planned meeting with all stakeholders will help shape a development brief inviting potential developers to come forward to transform the site and kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.In addition, the development brief will outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Local councillor Dermot Curran said the recent visit to the proposed Irish Street development site provided an insight into its size and development potential.He is backing the move to involve businesses and residents in helping shape the development brief for the site and hopes that the planned meeting at which they will be asked for their input can take place soon.ldquoWhat we are talking about is the biggest ever investment in Downpatrick town centre. We have to get this right as it has the potential to not only regenerate Irish Street, but the wider town centre by attracting increased footfall which will boost existing businesses, many of them locally owned, said Cllr Curran.ldquoIt is clear that having viewed the Irish Street site that it offers massive potential and can transform Downpatrick town centre and provide a major boost for existing businesses.Cllr Curran said he has spoken to a number of business people who are keen to have the date of the meeting with consultants confirmed so they can attend to help play their part in shaping the future development of a prominent town centre site.He added: ldquoPeople want to see progress on this crucially important development.

Pat Havern, Corey Quinn and Donal OrsquoHare did most of the scoring that day, but Tipperary will be a dferent proposition at the weekend.New Tipp manager David Power, who famously led the county minors to an All-Ireland title in , has an abundance of talent at his disposal, but he will have to without star player Michael Quinlivan.The Clonmel Commercials man has decided to go travelling for a year and his absence is a huge loss to Tipperaryrsquos attack and the countyrsquos bid to regain their status in the top flight ahead of next seasonrsquos championship changes.Promotion is also a must for Down as well, as they too have huge aspirations of avoiding competing in the All-Ireland second tier competition.Down have just emerged from an indferent McKenna Cup campaign.Wins over Fermanagh and Antrim were cast aside when Tallyrsquos team were given a reality check by Tyrone in the semi-finals.Mickey Hartersquos experimental side simply over-powered Down and had too much physicality all over the park.Hopefully, Down will have learned from that game, but second guessing Tallyrsquos team selection ahead of Sunday is a dficult job.Definitely missing Sundayrsquos game will be vice-captain Caolan Mooney, the one player in the camp who has the ability to stand out from the rest. His unavailability through injury is a severe blow to Tallyrsquos aspirationsJohn OrsquoHare and Marc Hynes shared the goalkeeping duties in the two McKenna Cup games, but Castlewellanrsquos Rory Burns is still considered as the county number one.Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins, Burrenrsquos Kevin McKernan and Warrenpointrsquos Ryan McAleenan could well man the full back berths with Annaclonersquos Brendan McArdle also in the frame.A knee injury for Saulrsquos Pierce Laverty, picked up against Tyrone, could rule him out of action, but Daniel Guinness could well fill in for him at right half back. Captain Darren OrsquoHagan seems to be favourite to start at centre half back with a mixture of Ross Carr, McArdle, Mayobridgersquos Shane Annett and Guinness flanking him.Midfield has been a bit of a problem for Down, but Loughinislandrsquos Jonny Flynn should start in this sector with either Liatroimrsquos Liam Middleton, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan, Carryduffrsquos Owen McCabe or Longstonersquos Conor Poland most likely to get the nod.The set of six forwards will come from Poland, McCabe, Corey Quinn, Barry OrsquoHagan, Conor Maginn, Pat Havern, Donal OrsquoHare, Brendan Gallen, Ciaran Harney, Liam Kerr and Ross McGarry.Regardless of who Tally starts with, Tipperary will be no pushovers and now under Powerrsquos management, they will be keen to impress.Michael OrsquoReilly, Liam Fahey, Bill Maher, Robbie Kiely, Jack Kennedy, Conor Sweeney and Liam Treacy all showed up well in Tipperaryrsquos recent McGrath Cup campaign and did enough, even without Quinlivan, to suggest that they will be a tough nut to crack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 22%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Rumours were re this week that it could be another ten years before the adoption of the poundm-plus scheme to provide a lsquoring roadrsquo in Downpatrick.Work on the scheme first started in the late sixties and, ironically, the Department of Environment is preparing to make a public announcement within the next two weeks on the route they want the road to take.But on Monday Downpatrick councillor Mr Eddie McGrady told a meeting of Down councillors that there were local rumours of another ten-year delay.Within the past  hours it has become obvious that the warning could take on realistic proportions.It seems clear that a wall of objections will be raised of the scheme and it could particularly take years to smooth out negotiations and pare the way for a pubic inquiry, which now looks inevitable.Mr McGradyrsquos warning came during a council discussion on a planning decision to refuse alterations and extensions to a dwelling in Saul Street, which is expected to be in the path of the new road.He drew the councilrsquos attention to a planning approval for squash courts in St Patrickrsquos Avenue mdash also likely to be in the path of the road mdash offering one explanation for the conflicting decisions.ldquoThere are rumours that planning permissions might be given in certain circumstances because it might be ten years before the road is implemented, he said.CROSSGAR mdash The st Crossgar Boys Brigade will represent Down Battalion in the Northern Ireland district finals of the squad drill competition in Omagh on Saturday.The Lissara boys qualied for the finals by wining the annual Down Battalion competition held at Banbridge on Monday night.

beauty.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism.But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious geopark designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with those behind the bid confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors in particular.But securing geopark status is not just about delivering financial benefit.Geoparks in other areas have empowered local communities, providing them with opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.If the local bid for geopark status for a huge swathe of land covering Strangford and Lecale, the Mournes and Ring of Gullion is successful, the international designation is expected to play a key role in helping transform the local economy.The geopark brand will use the geological heritage of the three areas to develop sustainable tourism that generates economic benefits, while providing recreational opportunities and increased awareness of the arearsquos natural assets, working with landowners, businesses and communities.The ultimate aim of a geopark is to enhance the economy and develop employment opportunities for the people who live there, but the global brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a so-called bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020

The tourism season in Newcastle is now all-year long and we want to keep the car-park open.Cllr Devlin said that the council was ldquoa victim of its own success in being able to attract the numbers of visitors to the town.She questioned the proposalrsquos contention that Newcastlersquos parking demand ldquosignicantly decreases during the winter months.ldquoIt used to be that we would have parking problems during particular times such as the Festival of Flight and bank holidays. But now as long as its dry, Newcastle is busy and parking is a necessary part of the town centre, she said.ldquoWhen the overflow car park is not being used, itrsquos complete chaos and parking can create issues for residents in nearby folds.She asked council officers when the new overflow car-park would be open for business andthe current overflow area could be kept open in the interim to help with parking demand.Michael Lipsett, the councilrsquos director of active and healthy communities, said he envisaged the work lasting three months and promised that once the necessary planning approval was gained, his department would be preparing to tender for a contractor as soon as possible.Slieve Croob Cllr Andrew McMurray queried whether the car-park would be a ldquoblanket tarmac covering andit would encroach on the green space.He was told that the proposal was to use a synthetic grid which would allow grass to show through so it would look green but would also indicate the car spaces available and one-way traffic system planned.Mournes Cllr Harold McKee welcomed the development as a ldquogreat idea and said parking in Newcastle was ldquoan absolute nightmare at any time of the year.Cllr Devlin suggested that the current overflow parking area should be in continuous use until the new facility is opened.However, Mr Lipsett said he currently did not have the budget available to cover this but would investigate and report back..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Philip.jpg","title":"Philip and Helen in tandem at Kildare  ","story":"ON a bitterly cold Saturday morning Phillip and Helen Vint were at the start line for the latest in the East of Ireland Marathon series, at Staplestown, in North Kildare, which also provides half marathon and k alternatives, mostly for partners, like Helen who feel itrsquos nice to be there to support your other half, but who feel that running a marathon with them is pushing things a bit too far, . miles too far to be exact.The temperature was -C when they began running and a sultry +C when they finished and underfoot conditions were slippery by virtue of the frozen ice around the route.So, well done to both on completing what they describe as steady runs for their firsts of , Phillip in .. and fth place and Helen in .. and third place respectively.BornRunSaturday saw a big turnout,  in fact, for the sixth of the BornRun Run Forest Run Series.This week the venue was Gosford Country Park which will also host the NI  Ulster Intermediate and Masters Cross Country Championships next weekend.The only distance on offer this week was k and the route headed out in a loop around the start and continued towards the outer boundaries of the forest.The first k was quite level and took everyone into the scenic forest for k where there were a few small inclines, but overall it was a flat, fast course with a good run in the last k down to the finish line.No-one made better use of the terrain than East Downrsquos Jimmy Sloan, who fairly flew round the course in a superb ., which was almost two minutesahead of the second-placed Thomas Carson . with third place filled by Barry McAuley in ..I believe this is Jimmyrsquos first win in club colours and it certainly wonrsquot be his last, given his present form and continuing improvement, which in spite of hearing later that the distance was allegedly  metres short, nevertheless represents a great effort and time.

This year they donated a fantastic amount for the charities, said Raphael. ldquoI am delighted to see young people come on board to help others. They are a credit to their school and their families.Raphaelrsquos chance meeting with Martin, a homeless man living on the streets of Dublin whom he met during a visit to family members a number of years ago, was the catalyst for him to launch his annual appeal which has enjoyed tremendous community support.The photographerrsquos meeting with Martin underneath a railway bridge close to Pearse Street railway station had a profound impact on him, moving him to organise an appeal as soon as he ed home.ldquoThe sight of seeing Martin on Pearse Street back in  will be with me forever. To see homelessness on the rise across Ireland,north and south, means something is badly wrong. There doesnrsquot appear to be any political will to cure the problem. It there was, we would not have homelessness in a modern society. More needs to be done, immediately, said Raphael.Year on year the response to his appeal has increased and this year he will be looking for anyone interested in helping to get in touch to help with the collection, storage and distribution of donations.Raphael confirmed that he plans to launch his appeal for volunteers to join forces with him this October.ldquoI cannot begin to praise every single person who responded to my Christmas appeal. It was so overwhelming, he explained.ldquoAll I do is put the word out about my appeal and people come forward in great numbers to help. The response to the latest appeal was the biggest to date and I cannot thank people enough for their generosity and support.ldquoThe response from the public was truly unbelievable. I am particularly indebted to everyone, in particular, the staff and students at St Colmcillersquos High School.The annual appeal is particularly time-consuming for someone who runs his own business and that is why Raphael is hoping people will volunteer to help him in .ldquoEvery item that is donated has to be unpacked and checked to make sure it is okay to pass on. Then it has to be sorted, re-packed and stored until the time to deliver it comes. This takes up a lot of time and there is only so much one person can do, he explained.Raphael has also singled out the management and staff at Peter Fitzpatrick and Sons Estate Agents in Downpatrick for particular praise for allowing their Irish Street base to be used as a -off point for his appeal.ldquoThe business has been so supportive over the past number of years. I cannot thank them enough for all their help, he said.ldquoDePaul was over the moon with the items people donated and the fact that a signicant number of people took time out at Christmas to think of and help others is very humbling. If more people come forward to help me this year, together, we could do even more.In future Raphael hopes to deliver the majority of donations to more local charities and organisations. He said it only seems right that items collected are distributed locally so in future most of what he receives will go to local charities.He added: ldquoThe generosity and community spirit across the district is something to behold. All I do is announce details of the appeal and people across the community then donate in numbers.ldquoOnce the message gets out there, people are quick to respond and I am so grateful as are the organisations they are supporting.

Plenty of other charities out there who I will support – it has to work both ways. “Shame on you Macmillan and Cancer Research.” A spokesperson for Macmillan Cancer said that the campaign was not “aimed at encouraging people to go meat-free forever” and that they were “really disappointed” that people felt they couldn’t support their work because of the challenge.The charity’s Rachel Murphy said: “We’re very sorry this fundraising challenge has upset people in the farming community.

He looked at me straight in the eye, and said: ‘Son, I’ve got something that I need to tell you. It’s incredibly important. But I feel like I can’t go on with my le any more without actually sharing this information with you.’So we sat down at my kitchen table. We were eye to eye.He said: ‘Tim - for all of my le I have felt like a woman trapped in a man’s body.’I don’t claim to be deeply theological. I’m feet first, mouth first, brain second.Three men arrested after £ million cannabis seized - PSNI say drug dealers don’t care about communities Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Its a very odd moment in my le, where I actually stopped and I paused - and I said: God, what would you have me do in this moment And I just felt this sense of compassion. And I felt a sense of love. And I felt something inside of me say: I need you to hold his hand. I just need you to hold his hand.And that has been the defining moment in my relationship with my dad ever since.I gotta be honest with you. It’s incredibly dficult at times. There are times when I look at him and I want to punch him in the face. I want to kick him in the shins. I want to poke his eyes out.But I always come back to this thing, this heart, this desire, which is one of compassion, and the fact God said: You’ve got to hold his hand.‘HE TOLD ME HE WAS LEAVING MY MUM’He began to say that for all of his le he always felt dferent. He’d always felt like he was on the outside, like he never fitted in to any social group, and he found ways to cover that up - by being successful in business, successful in many dferent arenas and areas of le.He said: ‘I wake up every morning, I look at the mirror, and what I see doesn’t compute. What I see doesn’t make sense.’And so I got a little bit angry with him, I got a little bit frustrated with him, because he told me he was leaving my mum.I was fearful of the impact that was going to have on me as a ministry leader, as somebody engaged in le in the church, and how that would reflect on me and how that would look.I was afraid of how it was going to impact my children, who at that stage were all under the age of . What’s it going to be like for them in school  Grandad is now granny, and so on and so forth.And it was just this really really complex set of emotions, really. As a son I felt I was grieving the loss of a parent - that I was grieving the loss of my dad essentially because what I was now being presented with was what I believed to be an impostor.Now what I’d say is all of the characteristics that I admire in my dad still exist. He is incredibly generous, he is incredibly compassionate, he is incredibly loving. My dad was my hero. And my hero still exists today.And I think it’s really important for us as a church to remember those things. Whilst somebody might come and they might present themselves in a way that we think is foreign to how they should present themselves, the characteristics - the things that God put in them when they were born - have not disappeared.‘MUM THOUGHT HE COULD BE CURED’And so in my conversation with my dad and as we were unpacking stuff, I recognised and I realised that for  years my mother had been aware of the fact my dad was cross-dressing, that he had been struggling in this area of our le, and both of them together went to get some help from the NHS.When they presented themselves in front of the NHS, my mum thought they were going for a cure. What actually happened [was] the journey ended with my dad having an operation.I made an appointment to go and see the consultant that had approved my dad’s operation. And I sat down in his office, and I looked him in the eye, and I said: ‘Can you please tell me why you took my dad from me ’He said: ‘Tim, we’ve done research and we’ve seen that there’s a male portion of the brain and a female portion of the brain.And for somebody who’s struggling with gender dysphoria what has happened is what we believe medically is thatits your dad the female portion of his brain is more developed than the male portion of the brain.’ He said it’s like a cooker standing in the mirror and seeing a fridge.In the midst of all this and as I’m unpacking it, and as I’m kind of getting to grips with it and all of those things, I’m coming back to: I’ve got to hold his hand.And here’s what’s really important to remember: that just because we accept something as somebody ’s reality, it doesn’t mean that we have to approve of it...The journey for us has been one of has been one of anger, the journey for us has been one of has been one of pain.Not only have I had to minister to my dad and his point of pain, but I’ve also had to minister to my mum, and I’ve had to minister to my we, and I’ve had to minister to my children, and I’ve had to minister to my church.My mum believes that her husband was robbed. She will look at you and say: the so-and-so left me for another woman - himself! She’s just incredible and sometimes humour is just so helpful. But what I had to witness was my mum fall apart because of a decision that my dad made.Now I don’t blame my dad for that decision any more. I’m less angry with him for that decision that I was in . But the reality of it is that that decision ripped the heart of my family out.FATHER’S DAY I don’t know what to do on Father’s Day, so I run a mile.Do I send him a Father’s Day card or do I wait til Mother’s Day and send him a Mother’s Day card My dad sent me the most beautul text message.He said: ‘Hey son, I’m so proud of the father that you’ve become. I love looking at how you love your children, what your children are becoming and what they have become, and I love you so much.’And he signed it ‘dad’. So he doesn’t even know half the time what to be saying!And this is the reality of the conversation around gender dysphoria. Most of us haven’t a clue what to say.But the reality of it is this: that Jesus came full of grace and truth.I think in the church we think that there’s a ‘truth’ camp, and we gotta give them the Bible and we gotta give them the Word - and we do. It’s the mandate, the blueprint for le.But then there’s the other side where we think ‘oh we’ve just got to love one another and it’ll be ok...’. And we forget about the Biblical mandate.The reality is that Jesus came in equal measure: grace and truth...And so when we’re investing in relationships, when we’re journeying with people, when we come to that heart of compassion, and we hold hands with the broken and the lost, become full of grace and truth. And that’s the reality of my journey with my dad.•This talk was delivered by Tim last summer, and streamed online by the Evangelical Alliance.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"politics","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health. Especially the drugs part of it.ldquoI needed to do something about it and thatrsquos when I started my fitness journey.ldquoWith my addictive personality, when I do something, Irsquove got to do it ndash not just dip my toes in.ldquoI started looking into veganism because a lot of endurance athletes were vegan. The more I researched it the more it started making sense to me.ldquoI love animals. Irsquove got a dog and I wouldnrsquot eat him. Whatrsquos the dference between a dog and a pig  All these things started making sense to me.ldquoAs soon as I became vegan, I felt healthier. So many people were trying to put me off it.ldquoBut on a vegan diet, I did The Decker, which is  full Iron Men in  days.ldquoNow Irsquom looking at doing the Double Decker which is  in  days. On my th birthday Irsquoll be doing  of something for  years.ldquoItrsquos another way of proving to people that veganism helps me, and that age is but a number.Pritchard became vegan in  and began to film his own cooking show on YouTube. In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it. Therersquos a lot of education.ldquoWhen it goes out on TV, I get a lot of positive messages from people saying theyrsquove cut down on meat.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos more crucial than ever we re-elect a Welsh Labour Government in . But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

January , : pm\"\"Parents are dipping into their kids savings to supplement day-to-day living costs, a study has found.Researchers polled , mums and dads and found one fth have borrowed money from their childrens piggy banks and accounts in order to pay their living expenses.Nearly half of those have taken cash out of their little ones savings to pay household bills, with  per cent borrowing money to cover the cost of groceries.And, ironically, more than one sixth have done so in order to cover childcare.The research was commissioned by comparethemarket as part of their latest Parentdex report on pocket moneyJody Coughlan, Money Manager, at comparethemarket said: \"Fortunately for kids, the wider squeeze on the household budget seems to have had little impact on the generous amounts parents wants to give their children.\"That said, parents do need to ensure that they are able to give their kids this pocket money, without needing to dip into it to cover wider household bills.\"The report uncovers the spending habits of British children who receive an average of £ a month, totalling £ every year and giving them the equivalent of £.billion to spend collectively.Research also found kids savings accounts are relatively healthy, with the average child having a signicant £. stashed away.In fact, one fth of children have £, sitting in their savings.It also emerged children are generating a second source of income, with four in five parents giving their offspring extra money to cover unforeseen requests such as new clothing or nights out with friends.These ad hoc requests see one fth of parents topping up pocket money once a fortnight, and more than a quarter giving these extra handouts once a month.Meanwhile, the Bank of Gran and Grandad appears to be another fruitful source of income for kids.One quarter of grandparents find themselves contributing to kids income, with two thirds giving their grandkids generous handouts as and when they see them.Unsurprisingly, children in the capital are the recipients of the highest amount of pocket money compared to anywhere  in the UK, with the average parent in London giving £ to their child each month.In contrast, children in the east of England are given £ a month while those in the south west who are given £.Fortunately, the poll also shows mums and dads are confident in their childrens ability to manage their finances effectively, with almost three quarters believing the youngsters will be well equipped to handle money as they approach adulthood.In the absence of financial education at schools, this could be down to discussions at home, with nine in  stating they have talked about money management with their children.However, parents clearly feel their children would benefit from additional teaching in schools, with four fths of those polled believing schools should do more to teach financial education.Jody Coughlan added: \"Its incredibly encouraging to see the number of parents who are willing to talk to their children about financial management from such an early age.\"Not only will this do more to prepare them for financial responsibility in the long run, but it should also help to lessen their long-term dependence on the Bank of Mum and Dad as a result!\"\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\"

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/edel1.jpg","title":"leaders in business edel doherty beyond business travel","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster BusinessEdel Doherty’s grand ambitions for her business travel firm probably should come as no surprise to those who know her – it’s a sector which she has worked in her entire le.A decade ago she founded Beyond Business Travel, a business with a £m turnover and around  staff. Now, the aim is to grow that to £m, which includes a new office in Dublin to expand its market reach right across Ireland.“We are hoping to take that to £m in the next four years and we have opened an office in Dublin,” she told Ulster Business.“It’s an ambitious target, but we have grown year-on-year for the past nine years and have brought a lot of technology into the business and to our clients.”The client list reads like a who’s who of the giants of Northern Ireland industry, including poultry processor Moy Park, Almac and Devenish Nutrition. The firm has also looked after those on the Game of Thrones crew.“We have a strong track record of getting and maintaining good clients,” she says. “We are a new breed of travel management company. We want to make a dference in client businesses. “People, the human capital, is what the business is and making sure they are looked after while they travel is a big thing for us – doing it effectively, making sure they have the support,  .“I’ve been in travel for more than  years and I’m passionate about it. It has changed dramatically, with the rise of the smartphone.”That includes the development of booking tools for clients, but also looking ahead and building more advanced technology, incorporating articial intelligence and being able to personalise the experience for each traveller. Born in Belfast, Edel’s initial career trajectory looked set for university, but instead she wanted to go in to the world of work, and tackle the travel sector.“I went straight into the industry and I’m a great believer in le-long learning. I want to be the best version of me and to reach my potential,” she says. That includes working across dferent areas of the travel industry. But Edel says business travel “was always my love”.Edel is involved with the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Women in Business, as well as sitting on the CBI’s SME Council in London. She’s also just been named Businesswoman of the Year by Women in Business.And like many company founders, Edel hit the ground running with her own business as the world entered its worst recession in a generation. She was previously a director with a company for  years, before deciding to make the move and go it alone.“I made a business plan – I said to myself, I can do this, I know I can. I built a brilliant team around me, and almost  years later, here we are. It’s been hard work, but it’s enjoyable and I’m passionate about the Northern Ireland economy. I’m passionate about buying local.”As for Brexit, Edel says setting up the Dublin office was one was in which the firm was mitigating against any business concerns arising from Brexit.“It’s hard to plan when you don’t know. Business people are problem solvers,” she says. “Once we have a problem, we come up with a solution. But people are holding back on decisions. We did a complete analysis of our clients and they are down on last year. It completely filters down and there is a knock on effect and people are nervous.“A lot of our clients are exporters. If they are affected, everything from export documents, to the movement of goods and people – that willimpact.”Looking to the future and Edel’s ambitious £m turnover target she says leading the way in tech and being early adopters is helping to drive expansion.“We are looking out at what’s coming – some clients won’t work without technology, and we have tech bedded in. It’s tried and tested.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.
