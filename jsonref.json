The singer was having lunch at his Algarve retreat in August 2014 when the police raided his luxury apartmentThe ramifications of that dramatic raid on August 14, 2014, are still being felt today. But the sorry saga started two months earlier when BBC reporter Dan Johnson received a tip-off from a confidential source.It was at the height of Operation Yewtree, the extraordinary Metropolitan Police investigation into a string of celebrities following the Jimmy Savile scandal.A junior but ambitious reporter, Mr Johnson said his tipster had revealed there was ‘one more high profile person being investigated’. The reference was oblique, but the journalist guessed correctly it was Sir Cliff. And when the source told Mr Johnson, whose BBC patch is the north of England, that the investigation was ‘closer to home’, he also worked out it involved South Yorkshire Police.Although Mr Johnson never named his source, the court ruled yesterday it was most probably either a police officer from the Yewtree inquiry or someone associated with the police.The reporter was on the trail of what his boss called a ‘bloody cracking’ scoop – but he was described by the judge as ‘capable of letting his enthusiasm for his story get the better of his complete regard for truth’.‘BLACKMAILING’ THE POLICEOn July 9, armed with his sensational tip, Mr Johnson spoke on the phone to South Yorkshire Police’s head of communications, Carrie Goodwin. When he casually asked whether Sir Cliff was ‘on their radar’, she gave ‘an audible gasp’, he told the court.          Police officers search the property of pop star Sir Cliff Richards in Sunningdale, Berkshire in August 2014. Sir Cliff watched the breaking news Miss Goodwin, who had been privately briefed about the highly sensitive investigation by police chiefs, remarked that he had good sources, claimed Mr Johnson.Miss Goodwin told Matthew Fenwick, the detective superintendent leading the investigation, and chief constable David Crompton. The police say they decided to co-operate with the BBC to avoid the story being broadcast and tipping off their suspect before they were ready to swoop on his home.They invited Mr Johnson in for a meeting. At 1pm on July 15, he met Miss Goodwin and Mr Fenwick – and their discussion is hotly contested.The reporter claimed police voluntarily gave him information about their investigation, confirming it involved a 13-year-old boy allegedly sexually assaulted in a dressing room after a Billy Graham event in Sheffield in the 1980s.But the force said Mr Johnson already knew these details and used them to ‘blackmail’ police into giving the BBC advance notice of their raid on Sir Cliff’s apartment.Either way, a deal was struck. Miss Goodwin said the police would give Mr Johnson the date and location of the search if he agreed not to broadcast the information in advance.EXCITEMENT AT THE BBCJubilant that his ‘tactics’ had worked, Mr Johnson told his BBC editor Declan Wilson, who passed it on to his own boss, Gary Smith, with an email entitled: ‘Sit down when you read this.’In reply, Mr Smith quoted from Sir Cliff’s 1968 Eurovision Song Contest entry by saying: ‘Congratulations. And jubilations. I want the world to know I’m happy as can be.’ Mr Wilson claimed police had even considered arresting tennis fan Sir Cliff at Wimbledon, adding: ‘Off record, they want the publicity as they believe there are others.’          A very emotional looking Sir Cliff Richard seen leaving the High Court after winning his battle with the BBC. The judge said: ‘Excitement was being created in the BBC over the prospect of the story.’ When Mr Johnson was asked by his boss how he had managed to persuade the police, he said he had got detectives ‘over a barrel because of the tip-off I had received’.On the evening of August 13, police stuck to their deal and gave the journalist the details he needed. They even emailed him an aerial photo of the apartment block.The BBC machine swung into action. Camera teams were dispatched to the apartment in Berkshire, police HQ in Sheffield, Sir Cliff’s home in the Algarve and his other home in Barbados. And that helicopter was fired up.Mr Smith, the BBC’s UK news editor, wrote in a gleeful email: ‘The money shots will be police going in and out of his flat and loading bags of hard drives or whatever into their vans. We can only get this from the helicopter.’BBC BEAT POLICE TO THE DOOROn the morning of August 14, Operation Kaddie was launched – and hapless police found the BBC were already there.Mr Johnson and two other reporters and their crews had set up camera angles well before 9am, ready to cover the drama live. As the helicopter hovered overhead, a police press officer updated Mr Johnson with text messages.Woman \u0027saw a black Mercedes like the one owned by Borce...Share this articleIn five cars, eight police officers entered the gated estate at 9.35am. They spoke to a building manager who phoned Sir Cliff in Portugal to tell him police had arrived with a warrant to search his home. Sir Cliff later told how, as a decent, law-abiding citizen, all he thought was that he must help the police and instructed the manager to ‘Please let them in’.Police entered the apartment at 10.40am, and three minutes later Mr Johnson was informed by text.From the camera in the helicopter, officers were filmed going through the singer’s possessions. And on the ground, an officer read a prepared statement to a BBC crew. By now, Sir Cliff’s lawyers had been alerted too and were racing to the scene.A ‘HUDDLE’ IN THE NEWSROOMIn the BBC newsroom at 12.15pm, managers held a ‘huddle’ to discuss their scoop and whether to name Sir Cliff, even though police had not. The go-ahead was given by deputy director of news Fran Unsworth, who considered it ‘strongly’ in the public interest.At 1pm the BBC unveiled its ‘top story this lunchtime’ along with dramatic footage of the police raid.          News helicopter images of police arriving to search the Berkshire property belonging to Sir Cliff Richard in relation to an alleged historical sex offence. The ‘vile’ allegations hung over him for almost two years until the police dropped the case without any charges The broadcast went live to Mr Johnson outside the property, and he continued his breathless reports on the BBC News Channel all afternoon. In total there were 44 BBC TV broadcasts that afternoon, with Sir Cliff’s strenuous denials added to the reports from 2pm.A BBC editor, Richard Clark, sent Mr Johnson a congratulatory email saying: ‘Good work, Dan. Well done.’ The reporter replied it was ‘old-fashioned journalism’.But by the evening, an explosive row was brewing.THE FALLOUTOn Radio 4’s Six O’Clock News, respected home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw suggested the BBC’s tip-off had been an ‘attempt by the police to ensure maximum coverage’ of the raid.South Yorkshire Police responded angrily, saying they had not tipped off Mr Johnson, who had ‘blackmailed’ them. Press chief Miss Goodwin complained to him: ‘This wasn’t the case and brings the force into disrepute.’She wrote to her chief constable: ‘It’s wildly inaccurate. The Met leaked it and we asked the BBC not to run it.’ As police prepared an explosive press release claiming the BBC had been fed the tip by Operation Yewtree, Mr Johnson, knowing his tip-off had come from someone outside South Yorkshire Police, begged his superiors to put out a correction to the Danny Shaw report.

The boys attended a ceremony at Wat Pha That Doi Wao in Mae Sai near the Myanmar border where they prayed for longevity and a good life. The government also wants the boys to have a period of mental rehabilitation\u0027This (story) has all the right elements,\u0027 Vira said. \u0027If you talk about drama associated with filmmaking, it has everything. It has loss as well as jubilation. The content and story it has for filmmaking is very complete. Even if you don\u0027t create additional drama, these events had every flavour.\u0027Wissanu said that it is the boys\u0027 right to sign contracts for their own benefit, but added that the government committee would provide advice \u0027like a manager,\u0027 but without seeking any profit for itself.He said the government was \u0027very afraid\u0027 that some of those close to the ordeal could be coerced to sign contracts \u0027because once a contract is signed, that person can\u0027t do anything else, which is why someone with legal knowledge needs to step in and help.\u0027Several murals and sculptures have already been commissioned to mark the epic cave adventure.

Among the items on display is a family photo of Charles holding his first grandchild, Prince George, with the Duke of Cambridge beside him. (To the right is an 18th century Japanese-style bureau cabinet)          One of the works which reflects the Prince\u0027s cultural side is this 18th century masterpiece The Tribuna of the Uffizi by Johan Joseph Zoffany. Considered the German artist\u0027s greatest painting, it depicts a group of aristocrats set against a backdrop of masterpieces. It was commissioned by Queen Charlotte in 1772, but she actually disliked the finished product. Zoffany was criticised for including too many figures, and according to one historical diary, the Queen \u0027would not suffer the picture to be placed in any of her apartments\u0027. Charles, however, is a fan of the intricate painting          Charles selected more than 100 pieces from private family paintings and photographs, major art from the Royal Collection and work by up-and-coming artists for the attraction - entitled Prince and Patron - which marks his 70th birthday year. Among the items above, a painting of Charles II is adjusted by a member of the Royal Collection Trust staff. On display are works from such masters as Holbein, Raphael, Rubens and Titian  In one section, painted oil sketches of William and Harry (above, right) by Nicola Philipps are hung next to watercolours painted by Charles in the 1990s on the Queen\u0027s private Balmoral estate. Below are marble busts of the prince\u0027s great-great-great-grandparents Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, who themselves were well-known art lovers. The piece in the centre is a sketch of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, circa 1841  One of the highlights of the exhibition is Napoleon Bonaparte\u0027s red felt hooded cloak (left) - a stunning artefact the heir to the throne knows well from Windsor Castle, where it was on display for a number of years. The cloak was taken from Bonaparte\u0027s baggage train immediately after the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and given to the future George IV by the Field Marshal who fought alongside the Duke of Wellington.

She said that when trade in services and repatriation of profits are taken into account, the figures favor the U.S.Merkel, now in her fourth term, said tit-for-tat tariffs imposed or threatened between the United States and China could cause collateral damage to German automakers such as BMW, which has its biggest plant in the U.S.\u0027We see these potential tariffs both as a breach of WTO rules and also as a danger to the prosperity of many in the world,\u0027 she said.Merkel said that trans-Atlantic cooperation, including with the president, is \u0027of course central for us and I will continue to nurture it,\u0027 adding that cooperation produces \u0027win-win\u0027 situations.Merkel, a conservative who grew up in Communist East Germany, welcomed Trump\u0027s invitation to Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet in Washington this autumn and said it should become normal again for US and Russian leaders to meet.But she added that she had been right to say a year ago that Europe could no longer rely on the United States to impose order on the world, and that it needed to take matters close to home into its own hands.\u0027We can\u0027t rely on the superpower of the United States,\u0027 Merkel said, describing possible U.S. tariffs on imported cars as \u0027a real threat to the prosperity of many in the world\u0027."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/20/06/4E69AC8E00000578-0-image-a-12_1532064542749.jpg","title":"Barbican chairman blasted comparing Welsh language dyslexic","story":"    The chairman of the Barbican centre in London has been slammed over this tweet in which he appeared to make fun of the Welsh languageMs Wood tweeted him saying: \u0027As the chair of the Barbican centre in London, why would you show such ignorance, spite and lack of culture as you have displayed in this tweet?\u0027If it was meant to be a joke, it just isn\u0027t funny.

While her owner searched for her in vain for hours, Rosie swam five miles to shore          Rosie\u0027s owner, Scott Crewell, said that he\u0027d just removed her life vest to let her fur dry off and they were about to head home, when Rosie jumped into the lake to chase ducks  But, just as they were getting ready to go, Crewell said Rosie saw some ducks by the boat and \u0027decided she was going to go chase them.\u0027Rosie, who Crewell said loves chasing all manner of small animals, jumped off the boat and immediately disappeared into the darkness. \u0027I started moving with the boat, listening for the ducks,\u0027 Crewell said. \u0027I could hear them getting further and further away. The direction she was going in was the worst direction on the lake because it was the farthest distance.\u0027Crewell then enlisted a friend\u0027s help to search the water for Rosie. They looked for the pooch all night and into Tuesday morning. He said that after so much time had passed, he eventually got to the point where he \u0027wanted to find her one way or another whether it was her floating in the water. I just wanted to find her.\u0027          A local lost pet group was able to help reunite Rosie (pictured  after the ordeal) with Crewell           The vet said that Rosie was in good shape, although she was tired and weak from her swim. Her eyes were also irritated and she was put on antibiotics and a bland diet  Crewell said that whenever they\u0027re out on the water, he\u0027ll be leaving Rosie\u0027s life vest on until they reach dry land, just in case she feels the need to jump in after ducks againShare this articleDuring his search, Crewell turned to his close friend, Steve Caporizzo, coincidentally a NEWS10 meteorologist and local animal advocate, for help in getting the word out about Rosie, in case anyone had found her. At 5.33am on Tuesday, Caporizzo posted a missing pet alert about Rosie on his Pet Connection Facebook page.  The social media alert paid off — as a fisherman had found Rosie by the shoreline.Caporizzo updated the alert at 3.39pm to say that the fisherman who found Rosie initially thought she was a wolf, until he saw that she was wearing a red harness. He then called his daughter, who happened to have seen Rosie\u0027s missing pet alert online. The fisherman\u0027s daughter called Crewell and \u0027boats and jet skies made their way to this spot and they found her,\u0027 Caporizzo wrote.It turned out that while Crewell was desperately searching for Rosie, she\u0027d been steadily swimming the five miles across the lake, heading for dry land.  \u0027I don’t even know how she made it that far. It’s amazing,\u0027 Crewell told the news station while wiping away tears. Caporizzo posted yet another update to Rosie\u0027s story on Wednesday, revealing that veterinarians had checked out Rosie. She was tired and weak and her eyes were irritated, but she was otherwise in good shape.  The vet put Rosie on antibiotics and a bland diet since she had a hard time keeping food down.   Going forward, Crewell told NEWS10 that whenever he takes her out on the water, he\u0027ll be keeping Rosie\u0027s life vest on until for the duration, until they\u0027re firmly back on dry land, on the off-chance she decides to jump in after any more ducks.Dog swims 5 miles to safety after jumping off boat"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/20/18/4E706E1D00000578-0-Prince_Philip_is_not_often_seen_at_public_events_following_his_r-a-103_1532106454625.jpg","title":"When time Prince Philip attended Royal event Queen","story":"    The Queen and Prince Philip were photographed together at the Royal Windsor Cup polo patch in late June      Virgin Media customers to lose access to all 10 UKTV channelsGeorge RR Martin\u0027s Nightflyers: Everything we know so far about the Netflix showCats movie: Cast, director, plot and moreWho is Bristol Palin?

Thirteen-year-old boy who spent 18 days...Prayers for a hero: Thai cave boys visit Buddhist temple on...Share this articleWissanu said the boys are protected by child protection laws and information protection laws.The rescue, carried out successfully against high odds, was a rare bit of feel-good news from Thailand, which has been mired in political conflict and heavy-handed military rule for more than a decade.Even as the world watched the cave saga, a boat sinking off a southern resort island claimed almost 50 Chinese tourists, an event that normally would have registered as a high-profile debacle.The cave rescue also allowed the government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who has been criticized for political maneuvering to stay in power after elections planned for next year, to share in some glory.Thai officials vet scripts and regulate filming           The rescued boys have been praised for showing great morale, mental and physical strength during the ordeal. Culture minister Vira Rojpochanara said boys could sign contracts but government could advise \u0027like a manager\u0027  The boys have been allowed to returned to \u0027normal\u0027 life following a press conference where they spoke to the world\u0027s media. Vira said the committee would oversee content, licensing and the protection of privacy of the rescued team and their families The government\u0027s Thailand Film Office already regulates the production of films shot in Thailand by foreign companies, including vetting scripts and issuing filming permits.Vira said the committee would oversee content, licensing and the protection of privacy of the rescued team and their families.Vira, speaking after a film board meeting said five foreign film production companies have shown interest in making a movie or documentary about the cave rescue and some had already been on location to collect information.Thai film producers have also shown interest but have not yet contacted the government, Vira said.The boys and coach of the Wild Boars soccer team were released from the hospital on Wednesday and at a news conference described how they got trapped in the cave, and after 10 days cut off from the outside world, were astonished to see two British ers rising from muddy waters and assuring them work was underway to rescue them.          The boys attended a ceremony at Wat Pha That Doi Wao in Mae Sai near the Myanmar border where they prayed for longevity and a good life. The government also wants the boys to have a period of mental rehabilitation\u0027This (story) has all the right elements,\u0027 Vira said. \u0027If you talk about drama associated with filmmaking, it has everything. It has loss as well as jubilation. The content and story it has for filmmaking is very complete. Even if you don\u0027t create additional drama, these events had every flavour.\u0027Wissanu said that it is the boys\u0027 right to sign contracts for their own benefit, but added that the government committee would provide advice \u0027like a manager,\u0027 but without seeking any profit for itself.He said the government was \u0027very afraid\u0027 that some of those close to the ordeal could be coerced to sign contracts \u0027because once a contract is signed, that person can\u0027t do anything else, which is why someone with legal knowledge needs to step in and help.\u0027Several murals and sculptures have already been commissioned to mark the epic cave adventure. Many focus on Saman Gunan, a former Thai navy SEAL who volunteered to help with the rescue effort and died while ing on a mission to supply the cave with oxygen tanks essential to helping the boys escape. Saman is being treated as a national hero.          Artists are creating a huge mural of the cave rescue in Chiang Rai, Thailand"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/20/11/02BDC7C500000514-5973881-image-a-3_1532081675539.jpg","title":"Queen s income estate rises 1m","story":"    The Queen\u0027s private income has been boosted by almost a million pounds to just over £20million, new accounts have revealedThe Queen\u0027s private income has been boosted by almost a million pounds to just over £20million, new accounts have revealed.Money from the Duchy of Lancaster estate, which is used to fund her public and private activities, increased by 4.9 per cent.Figures for the 2017 to 2018 financial year show the amount Her Majesty received has risen from £19.2million the year before to £20.1million.The 18,433 hectare Duchy estate, which was founded in the 13th century is a unique portfolio of land, property and assets.The assets range from office blocks in The Strand to holidays homes, Bolingbroke Castle and a swathe of the tidal mudflats in Lincolnshire - held in trust for the sovereign.It also owns the Savoy Estate, a stretch of prime real estate in central London which houses the iconic Savoy Hotel.The Queen is not entitled to touch the capital of the estate but profits from the property empire go into the Privy Purse, providing a ‘private’ source of income for the monarch.The Queen is entitled to spend the money as she wishes but also uses it to help support members of her family like Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Princess Anne.

While her owner searched for her in vain for hours, Rosie swam five miles to shore          Rosie\u0027s owner, Scott Crewell, said that he\u0027d just removed her life vest to let her fur dry off and they were about to head home, when Rosie jumped into the lake to chase ducks  But, just as they were getting ready to go, Crewell said Rosie saw some ducks by the boat and \u0027decided she was going to go chase them.\u0027Rosie, who Crewell said loves chasing all manner of small animals, jumped off the boat and immediately disappeared into the darkness. \u0027I started moving with the boat, listening for the ducks,\u0027 Crewell said. \u0027I could hear them getting further and further away. The direction she was going in was the worst direction on the lake because it was the farthest distance.\u0027Crewell then enlisted a friend\u0027s help to search the water for Rosie. They looked for the pooch all night and into Tuesday morning. He said that after so much time had passed, he eventually got to the point where he \u0027wanted to find her one way or another whether it was her floating in the water. I just wanted to find her.\u0027          A local lost pet group was able to help reunite Rosie (pictured  after the ordeal) with Crewell           The vet said that Rosie was in good shape, although she was tired and weak from her swim.

He then called his daughter, who happened to have seen Rosie\u0027s missing pet alert online. The fisherman\u0027s daughter called Crewell and \u0027boats and jet skies made their way to this spot and they found her,\u0027 Caporizzo wrote.It turned out that while Crewell was desperately searching for Rosie, she\u0027d been steadily swimming the five miles across the lake, heading for dry land.  \u0027I don’t even know how she made it that far. It’s amazing,\u0027 Crewell told the news station while wiping away tears. Caporizzo posted yet another update to Rosie\u0027s story on Wednesday, revealing that veterinarians had checked out Rosie. She was tired and weak and her eyes were irritated, but she was otherwise in good shape.  The vet put Rosie on antibiotics and a bland diet since she had a hard time keeping food down.   Going forward, Crewell told NEWS10 that whenever he takes her out on the water, he\u0027ll be keeping Rosie\u0027s life vest on until for the duration, until they\u0027re firmly back on dry land, on the off-chance she decides to jump in after any more ducks.Dog swims 5 miles to safety after jumping off boat"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/20/19/4E6F5E3B00000578-5975683-image-a-15_1532110911064.jpg","title":"Worlds test tube baby pays tribute forgotten IVF pioneer gave life","story":"    Louise Brown, the world\u0027s first test tube baby, in her mother\u0027s arms.

No one trusted him, this outsider with a southern accent and a fancy camera, parachuting in from the city’s leafy Nether Edge area. They didn’t appreciate him hanging around Hyde Park flats, snatching photographs of them as they went about their lives amid the brutalist concrete they called home, perched on the hill above Sheffield railway station.He started to leave his posh Billingham bag at home. His Hasselblad, worth thousands, went in a carrier bag with a towel at the bottom to protect it. Sometimes he never even took it out. “Often I’d go up there and not take any pictures,” he says. “I’d just sit on a bench and smoke and chat to people, go for coffee at the drop-in centre. There’s always someone on an estate who knows everyone, so I found that person and got them to introduce me to everyone else.”It was 1988 and Hyde Park was set for demolition. Barely 20 years after its construction, residents were about to be scattered across Sheffield’s seven hills. It was a sad ending for what had been – along with its sister development, Park Hill – the ultimate symbol of Sheffield council’s pioneering postwar vision for social housing.It would have been easy, says Stephenson, to have just done “alienation” photography: “You just get someone standing in this brutal concrete environment with the building towering over them and the wind whistling around them.” The flats have often been depicted as a brutalist nightmare: director Shane Meadows used Park Hill as the home of his This Is England ’90 characters when they started smoking heroin.But Stephenson didn’t want to go down that road. The people he met, wandering around with his carrier bag and its precious cargo, loved living in Hyde Park. Yes, times were tough, with many residents unemployed after the closure of the pits and the steelworks. But they were proud of their community and didn’t want to move. He set about photographing them at home, sunbathing on the balconies, playing snooker at the youth club and canoodling in the doorways. There are bubble perms and stonewashed denim, knee socks and white stilettos, Saturday night gladrags and grubby playclothes. One particularly pleasing image shows Sue, a community linchpin and owner of the estate’s shop, stacking Nice’n Easy hair dye in her overalls. Her slightly raised eyebrows seem a warning to anyone who asked for credit – known locally as “strap”, as in “strapped for cash” – and didn’t pay it back. She’d name and shame them, Stephenson recalls, using cards placed in her shop window. Another afternoon he caught two girls, Anita and Emma, looking fed-up as they delivered newspapers in their rollerboots and school skirts.It wasn’t strict documentary photography. Most of the images are posed. Stephenson calls them “semi-formal”. He didn’t manipulate his subjects or get them to do anything they weren’t already doing, but he had their permission to shoot and they had a veto on their photos being made public.His favourite image was of a strapping young black lad known locally as Tony the Ton, who was mucking about with his eight-year-old nephew, Martin. Both are topless: Tony in red tracksuit bottoms and Martin in little grey shorts, his knees knocked together as he mirrored his uncle’s crossed arms. “I was just there talking to them and captured the moment,” says Stephenson. “They didn’t feel threatened by me.”Many of the pictures show what had become a very mixed community. One captures a teenage couple, Faisal and Paula, their arms entwined outside the service lift. He is wearing Joe Bloggs jeans with transfers on them, she is in baggy denim and an argyle sweater. He looks Asian, she is white – and seems shyly delighted to have bagged a boyfriend.Stephenson admits to seeking out these relationships. “At the time,” he says, “there had been a series of race riots across the UK and the press liked to talk a lot about racial tension, which I didn’t think told the whole story at all. What I saw at Hyde Park was a community that integrated beautifully.”The resulting pictures featured in a show at Sheffield’s Untitled gallery in 1988 and then toured nationally. Thirty years on, Stephenson’s pictures are about to go on display again, this time only a few minutes away from where they were taken. S1 Artspace, a gallery and collection of artists’ studios, has relocated from the city centre to the old residents’ garage behind Park Hill, which was listed by English Heritage in 1998 and is midway through a massive regeneration project by developers Urban Splash.S1 Artspace reopens in its new home today with Love Among the Ruins, a show that juxtaposes Stephenson’s pictures of Hyde Park with shots taken by another social documentary photographer, Roger Mayne, between 1961 and 1965. Mayne had been commissioned to show the early days of Park Hill, when it was the place everyone wanted to live – and before the Corbusier-inspired walkways designed for milkfloats had become a convenient escape route for ne’er-do-wells doing drug runs on their bikes.His images show the utopian vision of the architects, Jack Lynn and Ivor Smith, who had been tasked with solving the city’s housing and health crises by creating high-rise communities that would enjoy the same amenities as traditional neighbourhoods. The striking difference between Mayne and Stephenson’s images is the gender mix. In the 1960s, Park Hill appeared almost entirely populated by women. Bundled up in overcoats, curlers visible under head scarves, they went to the bingo and bossed the kids around while the men were out at work.By the time Stephenson arrived, the men were unemployed and the council considered Hyde Park flats a failed experiment in social housing. Shortly after he took his final frame, the bulldozers were sent in. He has kept in touch with many residents. One, Donna Hargreaves, contacted him recently after seeing a photograph of herself that was used to advertise the S1 show in the Sheffield Star. He captured her as a 14-year-old, straddling the fourth floor concrete balcony in white shorts and a red and white striped T-shirt with her friend Carmen. Now in her mid-40s, she planned to attend this week’s opening.Others did not make it into middle age. One boy took his own life a girl died after a life of health problems. For some, being photographed was a confidence boost. Leroy, whom Stephenson photographed on the Hyde Park swings as a 14-year-old, contacted him recently. “He said, ‘I was amazed you wanted to photograph me. People like me were invisible then: black teenagers living on a housing estate like Hyde Park.’ He’s doing really well now and has a great job as an IT guy.”Life changed for Stephenson too. He started a family and, unable to make ends meet doing social documentary photography, began taking commercial work: weddings on Saturdays, TV work and PR gigs that never made his heart sing. But he will forever be proud of the eight months he spent traipsing around Hyde Park with his camera in a carrier bag."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78e4c12eed8d8b8f1014a46c869a61787f291e39/654_757_5943_3566/master/5943.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a2a1f48ae21b32f518f6acb4aaba2f3","title":"chuck palahniuk interview adjustment day black ethno state gay parenting incel movement","story":"The American novelist talks about extremism, learning about failure from Brad Pitt, the power of protest – and why losing nearly all his money has been ‘kind of nice’First his father-in-law died of cancer. Then came the suspicion that his income for the last few years had been embezzled by an accountant at his literary agency. And to top off Chuck Palahniuk’s 2018 so far, there was the death of Anthony Bourdain – fondly remembered by Palahniuk for a TV show they made together in 2007, doing a gastronomic tour of the novelist’s hometown, Portland, Oregon. “It’s been a spring to remember,” he murmurs.I’d idly assumed that the author of Fight Club, Choke and other vivid studies of all kinds of American violence would be an expansive raconteur, maybe even a bit boorish and alpha. But sitting in the lofty space where he teaches writing in Portland, he is gentle and thoughtful, choosing his words carefully. “It’s looking like my payment for at least my last two – perhaps four – books has been taken, and so that leaves me with no reserves to write the next book,” he says. “Money seems to have been taken over such a long period that they haven’t even established yet how much was taken, and from what accounts.” Palahniuk says the accountant, Darin Webb, would lie, telling him that the publisher hadn’t made the cash available, or that he was preoccupied with caring for his mother who has Alzheimer’s. Webb was charged with fraud in May. Depending on the terms of his next book deal, and on how much money is recovered in a settlement, Palahniuk may have to sell his house to stay afloat.What does it feel like, suddenly being so financially precarious? There’s a long, silent look down. “It’s kind of nice,” he decides. “Writing was initially my way of saving money, because if you’re writing, you’re not spending. So it throws me back into writing. There are larger issues in life – the embezzlement is dwarfed by my father-in-law’s death. And there’s the awareness that I’m the person who got me to this place, and I’m still that person, so I can still turn it all back around, and come up with something really strong and vibrant and interesting.”He has already done so with his latest novel, Adjustment Day, a satirical fantasy in which, threatened with a new war draft, American society is overturned via an armed insurrection. As in Fight Club in 1996, there’s a band of disfranchised men who find brotherhood and identity in violence. It also shares that book’s moments of body horror: maggots devouring a dead man’s face a gross-out moment with a catheter. “I include those scenes so it’s not just an exploration of emotions and intellect,” he says. “It’s really rare that art affects us on a corporeal level – on a physical, gut level.”But Palahniuk moves on to fresh ground, too. Following the uprising, the US self-segregates into white and black ethno-states, Caucasia and Blacktopia, while gays and lesbians of all ethnicities take over California, renaming it Gaysia. The redrawn map is the starting point for an analysis of race, sexuality, class and nationality, with a few love stories chucked in between the bulging cast of characters. Credibility is stretched – at one point a voice on a radio announces “the joy of fiction is that it only has to smell true” – but the book remains rooted in real-world ructions.“Very little of what I do is invention – most of what I do is journalism,” he says. Doing research for the novel, he interviewed groups already advocating for American ethno-states, including the white American Renaissance. And California could break into three states following a referendum vote in November. Palahniuk sees Americans as being “out of love with a narrative of one great rainbow, and everyone being homogenised and allowed to live within this system”. His own experience growing up in the 1970s in the nearly all-white town of Burbank, Washington, was that “we still had a great deal of domestic violence and crime and suicide. I never bought the idea that a white ethno-state would be a Disneyland fantasy. But I am fascinated by the idea that isolation is the only thing that might allow us to create something new. Culture is developed in isolation, and what I’m wondering is whether in this very wired world, there won’t be a return to that isolation.” Journalists, incidentally, are among the most victimised characters in the book: the Adjustment Day uprising of the title is brought about by a social media poll of the least popular people in society, and journalists are some of the first against the wall. “I think Americans are realising that journalism is so partisan now,” he says. “They’re sick of that.”After Adjustment Day, Blacktopia quickly becomes a kind of Wakandan paradise, full of pyramid-shaped spaceships. “I have no standing or authority to say anything unflattering about the black ethno-state,” he says. “I’m white, so I could make the whites total dolts I’m gay so I can trash the gays.”Gaysia, then, doesn’t fare so well. Gay people who want to emigrate there when they reach adulthood can only do so if there is a straight equivalent wanting to emigrate from Gaysia, and the imbalance leads to thousands trapped in limbo, working in labour camps. It plays with what Palahniuk sees as a fixation on parenthood in the gay community. “There’s no art or music in Gaysia – all expression is the expression of having children. So much culture was created by gay people because they were trained to be observant, because everything that kept them alive was from observing how straight people were, and aping and mimicking those ways of being, so they would not be destroyed. They then used those skills of observation to execute beautiful things that served the overall culture. But having kids is a full-time job – it doesn’t leave you a lot of time to be a sculptor. I and a lot of people in my generation, an older generation, felt that gay people were having children as a means of expression, and giving up this incredible heritage of artistic expression.” Caucasia, meanwhile, becomes a feudal system in thrall to the beefy overlords who brought about Adjustment Day: an incel fantasy where women are utterly subordinated (at least for a while). I tell Palahniuk that I’ve seen incels – “involuntary celibate” men angry at their lack of sexual partners – quoting Fight Club as an example of why one shouldn’t underestimate ordinary frustrated men. He is amused, saying that the book was previously quoted by adherents to The Game, Neil Strauss’s guide to picking up women for emotionally unattached sex.“It’s fascinating that the group that can’t get laid is now adopting the same language. It shows how few options men have in terms of metaphors: a skimpy inventory of images. They have The Matrix – there’s a lot of red pill, blue pill stuff – and they have Fight Club. The only other thing is Dead Poets Society, where men go into a cavern and say poems to each other, and they’re not going to adopt that.” Women, he says, have more literature about female social structures, the likes of The Joy Luck Club or How to Make an American Quilt. “Those have a script and roles and determined ways of being, that women can adopt in order to be together long enough to share their lives.” Don’t men have sports or the pub, instead? “Those social groups don’t produce the memes and one-liners and metaphors.” Palahniuk doesn’t see Fight Club as particularly gendered anyway. “It was more about the terror that you were going to live or die without understanding anything important about yourself.”Where does he see the incel movement going? “It might be comparable to Valerie Solanas’s Society for Cutting Up Men, these very extreme feminist movements,” he says. “The extreme always goes away.” What about the recent clashes between the “alt-right” and the Antifa (antifascist) movement, disruption that feels part of the fabric of Adjustment Day? “This is just my gut reaction: we saw very little protest during the two Obama terms, largely because people were reluctant to protest anything when we had our first black president, for fear of being judged as racist, regardless of the issue. So we’ve had this pent-up need for protest, because protest is a way to discover one’s power and potential in the world, to do battle against something, and” – aside from Ferguson, Missouri, and the “quiet protest” of the Occupy movement – “we haven’t been able to do battle against the government for eight years.“My generation drew an enormous amount of strength from battling against Reagan and Thatcher,” he continues. “They were the perfect white parents for us to rail against, and helped develop a sense of ourselves as a generation. And Trump is white, straight, a combination of Margaret Thatcher’s hair and Ronald Reagan’s body – he’s the perfect guy to rail against.” Adjustment Day has several narrators, so it’s uncertain where Palahniuk’s own sentiments lie. To some, then, he will seem a mere provocateur, or even a troll, but in an age of dogmatism, there’s something refreshing about his poker face. “If I write something really didactic, it’s resolved, it’s gone,” he says. “But if I write something that people can really argue about, that thing is going to be in the culture for ever. For example: is Fight Club good or bad? It’s consensual, but it’s violence. I’m trying to create this dazzling spectacle that’s not meant to perpetuate or generate anything, but to be a sorbet that allows you to taste the next thing. To be a little more present in the next thing.” You don’t want to see resolution? “No. Especially in creative work, resolution is death.” Given his year so far, it’s a credo that he needs to believe in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6f860a8f0e55a52c8b2034ade2a47981fcbfa19/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e79d8c1ec7872df3eee407c5b27b6409","title":"community venues breathe life into the uks left behind areas","story":"From Wanstead to Ramsgate, entrepreneurial locals are setting up shops, cafes and barsIn 2013, as the craft ale craze took off, TV producer Dan Clapton decided to try selling bottled beer on a stall at the Sunday market in the east London suburb of Wanstead. To his surprise he sold out and soon he was looking for premises.Rents on Wanstead high street were too high so Clapton opted for a railway arch in Forest Gate, Wanstead’s less well-heeled neighbour.The Wanstead Tap opened in early 2014 as a beer shop and cafe. Partly by chance and partly by design, it has morphed into one of the many cultural and social hubs that have sprung up in changing communities – from the Kent coast to Glasgow.During the day, community groups, charities, environmental groups and cycling clubs use Clapton’s venue at no charge for meetings and fundraisers. Up to 500 people come to the Tap’s quarterly street market for local artists. In the evenings it is an 80-seat venue for gigs by musicians, comedians and writers.“I thought, let’s do something with this space,” Clapton said, sitting on a leather sofa outside the arch. “It felt like a room above an old-fashioned pub where you could have neighbourhood meetings. People started approaching me saying: ‘I’ve got an idea – let’s do stuff.’”Clapton is waiting for the arrival of Kenney Jones, once the drummer for the Small Faces, the Faces and, after Keith Moon’s death, the Who. Jones is coming to talk about his autobiography, Let the Good Times Roll, to a sellout audience. Outside the Tap the local Newham Bookshop sells copies of Jones’s book for signing.Other writers who have appeared at the Tap include Viv Albertine of the Slits and Misha Glenny, whose book McMafia spawned the recent TV series. The Tap has also hosted comedians such as Rich Hall, Sara Pascoe and Alexei Sayle.Forest Gate is changing as middle-class families move in, attracted by relatively cheap houses and the imminent opening of the Crossrail station. “Prospective new residents come in almost weekly and tell us the Tap is a factor in them coming to Forest Gate,” Clapton says.As Clapton was trying out his beer stall, Humbi Pena was going stir crazy selling records on eBay from his family’s home in Ramsgate, Kent. He decided to branch out by opening a record shop and cafe in the seaside town. Four years on, Vinyl Head serves a mix of locals and newer arrivals attracted by Ramsgate’s creative scene and affordable houses. It serves food and hosts community groups, language classes, music, poetry and art events.“We have mums and kids, creative people and the older generation who use the cafe as a community hub,” Pena says. “It’s a place where people talk to each other.”Down the road in Margate, Cliffs also combines a record shop with food and cultural events as well as yoga, pilates and children’s dance classes.The Tap, Vinyl Head and Cliffs are part of a wave of independent venues that are focal points for community and artistic activity – often filling a cultural gap to offer activities and events to new arrivals looking for affordable family homes.When Brett Rehling and his wife, Tracey Fletcher, opened Kitchen Garden Cafe in the Birmingham suburb of Kings Heath in 2006 friends feared the worst. “People said: ‘Why are you doing it in Kings Heath?’” Rehling said. “The high street was full of charity shops, betting shops and greasy spoon cafes. No one went out in Kings Heath.”Their cafe, garden centre and gift shop became a focal point for families arriving from pricier Moseley, helping turn Kings Heath into one of Birmingham’s buzziest areas. The cafe’s main focus is music and it holds about three gigs a week, ranging from local musicians to international names such as Texas singer songwriter Beth Nielsen Chapman.Glad Cafe in Glasgow’s South Side and Deli Lama in Salford opened in 2012 in neighbourhoods with no local venue. Both have become favourites with growing artistic communities and locals who previously headed for the city centre for a cultural fix.Rachel Smillie, Glad Cafe’s owner, said: “A lot of people say Glad Cafe is responsible for making the area more creative and trendy but I think the time was right.”But can these labours of love make money? Yes but only with a great deal of perseverance and hard work.Linda Robson, who owns Deli Lama, said: “It’s been a struggle. We weren’t on people’s radar and it was hard work to get people through the door but it gets better every year. We have got loyal and dedicated customers.”Clapton rejects the term gentrification. “We’ve brought life here,” he says. “When we opened there were drug dealers on the corner making local residents unhappy. Within a week they were gone because they were too exposed.”Building Ramsgate’s cultural hub has taken its toll on Pena. He is selling the cafe to open a dedicated record shop next door though he expects the businesses to work together. “All we talked about at home was the next event,” he says. “It was overwhelming.”As well as music, the cafe’s activities include a monthly all-women comedy night and selling local art. Ingredients come from the cafe’s garden. On a gig day Rehling works 16 hours. “The music is my passion. I’m working but it’s something I want to do.”The cafe is a social enterprise and has an exhibition space for local artists, an 80-strong local choir and puts on up to six gigs a week. “Musicians coming from Europe, America or Africa will call up and say: ‘Can you do these dates,’” Smillie says.Former community worker Robson opened the cafe on rundown Chapel Street because she believed the area deserved its own venue. The cafe supports Salford producers and artists and holds gigs by local musicians. “We get a lot of students, artists and people who have lived in Salford all their lives,” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29bd2a860e7d32740bdea04376dd4d935244d455/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d69b4745a81edfc042791024fd1a0236","title":"house of fraser landlords take action over store closures","story":"Property owners file legal complaint, claiming insolvency process treats them unfairlyHouse of Fraser is facing a legal challenge from a group of landlords over a plan to close more than half its stores by next spring.The landlords, who filed a complaint via the court of session in Edinburgh on Friday, say that they were “unfairly prejudiced” during an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) that was approved by a majority of creditors, including landlords, last month.The group, who are being advised by accountancy firm Begbies Traynor and property advisory firm JLL, also allege there were “material irregularities in the implementation of the House of Fraser CVA”.The CVA plan involves the closure of 31 of House of Fraser’s 59 department stores, including the flagship in London’s Oxford Street. The closures will result in about 6,000 job losses from the 17,000-strong workforce and the company has warned the only alternative is to go into administration.The statement from the landlord group said it was “unjust” that House of Fraser’s majority shareholder, Nanjing Cenbest, which is part of China’s Sanpower conglomerate, was set to receive £70m for some of its shares in the ailing department store from a new investor, C.banner, as part of a wider rescue deal while landlords creditors take a financial hit.“It is our view, and that of our legal counsel, that landlords have been disproportionately affected during this CVA process not only compared to other creditors, but also to how they could have been treated if alternative routes to rescuing the business were fully explored,” the group said in a statement. They complained that they had not been properly consulted about the CVA or given sufficient information about how House of Fraser planned to trade over the coming months.The legal action is seen as a fightback by landlords against the increasing use of CVAs, which have become commonplace in recent months, with a string of struggling retail and restaurant businesses using them to offload unwanted outlets or cut rents.“CVAs were designed as a means to rescue a business, not simply a tool to shed undesirable leases for the benefit of equity shareholders,” said Mark Fry of Begbies Traynor and Charlotte Coates of JLL. “It is our collective view that the retail CVA process in the UK has become fundamentally flawed and needs correcting.”The CVA is a prerequisite of an investment deal that C.banner agreed with Nanjing Cenbest, chaired by one of China’s richest men, Yuan Yafei.A House of Fraser spokesperson said: “We note the statement made by Begbies Traynor and JLL on behalf of a group of landlords but at this stage we have not received anything formally. On the assumption that a challenge is filed in court, whilst we are disappointed, we look forward to robustly defending our position and we are confident that this will not affect our commercial plans.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2553efebe3db072d8e5b907f806a1f7d2c70964a/0_416_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cff5fb1c20daba836b91f35680e55156","title":"stacey cunningham new york stock exchange first female president","story":"She is the first woman to lead the New York Stock Exchange in its 226 years. Faced with falling sales and government pressure, though, she finds the attention to her gender a distraction by  Dominic Rushe. Photographs by Christopher LaneThe Fearless Girl is on the move. The bronze sculpture of a little girl defiantly facing off against Wall Street’s Charging Bull launched a million selfies and became an unlikely avatar of the #MeToo movement. Soon it will be transported a few hundred metres down the road in downtown Manhattan to confront another symbol of entrenched masculinity: the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Stacey Cunningham says she couldn’t be more delighted.“I think she’s fantastic,” says Cunningham, the 67th president of the NYSE and the first woman to head the male-dominated institution in its 226-year history. “For me, she is a message to iniduals, though. I think we need to call ourselves to action, especially as women, not to hold ourselves back.”Cunningham may be a fan of Fearless Girl, but she is not as happy with the gender-focused attention drawn by her elevation to one of the most high-profile jobs in finance. She gives a small, hard smile when asked about the coverage.She should not really be surprised. The number of women running businesses, let alone institutions of the stature of the NYSE, is still small. And the number of women running the US’s top 500 companies – many listed on the NYSE – fell this year.The floor of the stock exchange itself is also still a sausage fest. It is less male than it has been in the past, but that is because the number of men has been hacked away by technology, not ersity. The majority of the women on the exchange’s floor seem to be working for the 30-plus media outlets based there.Cunningham, 43, has been at the exchange on and off (and mostly on) since the 1990s. She says her surprise at the attention her appointment has brought may be because, in retrospect, she has always been gender-blind.“I always liked maths, science and problem-solving, so I gravitated towards engineering,” says Cunningham, who grew up in New Jersey, the fourth child of six, three boys, three girls. (“I’m the well-adjusted middle child,” she says.) She says she is disappointed that more girls don’t go into science and maths, but in her own case it was the obvious choice: “I didn’t think about that at all.”She must have had to tune out a lot. She first entered the NYSE in 1994 as an intern, when she was one of about 30 women among 1,000 men. “I walked in and right away I fell in love with the place,” she says. The “energy and the pace” reminded her of her family. “What struck me right away was the sense of community.”After she graduated, she came back to the NYSE, working on the trading floor until 2005, when she took time off to complete a culinary training course. She then worked at a rival stock exchange, the Nasdaq, as director of capital markets, before rejoining the NYSE and becoming the exchange’s chief operating officer in 2015.She acknowledges that things have changed for women at the NYSE in the decades since she first worked here. For one, they have proper bathrooms. When she started, women had to make do with one tiny bathroom converted from a phone booth, while the men’s bathrooms had a palatial lounge area.But she never experienced the rampant sexism other women in finance have complained about, she says. “When you walked through a trading floor 20 years ago as a woman, there was a little bit of you that could feel the room looking at you,” she says. But she says she never experienced any behaviour that made her uncomfortable.“In my experience, if I said to somebody: ‘Hey, that’s not OK, too much,’ and I said it with a smile, too, then they knew,” she says, giving that tight little smile again. “Whether it was the language people used, or something else that I didn’t appreciate, I just made it clear where I stood and I felt that I was respected for it. I’m not saying that every woman would have had that same experience. I’m sure there are women who tried to draw lines and they were ignored. I was fortunate that when I drew lines people stayed outside them.”Cunningham takes over the top spot at a challenging moment for the NYSE. Some of that is on view during my visit. I arrive for the opening bell that marks the beginning of the trading day and is a fixture of the financial news cable TV shows. We are corralled into a holding pen in line of the TV cameras as Cunningham rings the bell, alongside executives from BJ’s, a discount warehouse retailer, who are celebrating the launch of its share sale on the NYSE.The mood is frenetic, celebratory, somewhere between a graduation and the start of a race. But the energy is inside the corral, generated by the people who work for BJ’s, the exchange or the media organisations that report from the floor. Outside the pen, the number of brokers employed on the NYSE’s vast floor is in the hundreds, not the thousands of years gone by. You leave with the impression things will be pretty quiet once the opening ceremony is over.Most stock trading is now done electronically, principally from a far less photogenic datacentre in New Jersey. Its critics claim the exchange is a dog and pony show – Disneyland for capitalism, a marketing exercise where CEOs can ring a bell and a few traders run about looking busy for the cameras while the algorithms do the real work.“That floor is a TV station,” says one senior Wall Street executive, who did not want to be named. “There is pomp and circumstance, but it’s nothing but a bunch of clapping seals.”Cunningham and the NYSE could not disagree more. Algorithms cannot compete with human discernment and experience, or with days of big news. Cunningham mentions the day of the Brexit vote, for example – the human touch helped calm jitters. People bring “judgment”, she says. “One analogy we often use to describe how people add to that equation is an airline pilot. So, a plane can take off and land without a pilot. You don’t need to have a human being in the cockpit. But that human being adds value, especially during the most tumultuous times,” she says.Frankly, however, the argument over whether or not the NYSE’s much photographed neoclassical facade is sheltering a marketing operation or a vital financial institution is the least of its problems.One issue for all the exchanges, but the NYSE in particular, is that there are fewer and fewer share sales like that of BJ’s. Big companies such as Uber, Airbnb and WeWork are choosing to stay private for longer, powered by huge piles of private equity money.The competition – and some investors – are pressing the NYSE and the Nasdaq on their fees, while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US’s main financial watchdog, has a pilot scheme under review that aims to assess how, and if, the complex system of fees and rebates the NYSE and others pay to brokers for trading on their exchange affects trading.Critics argue that the rebates on broking fees offered by the NYSE and others to encourage traders to use their market create a conflict of interest. They incentivise brokers to send their customer orders to exchanges that pay the biggest ones, even if their clients might be better served elsewhere.The two-year pilot, which has the support of some huge pension funds, would allow the SEC to assess their impact on how trades are made. But Cunningham says the scheme is poorly designed – it does not include the dark pools, for example – and the Nasdaq has hinted that it may sue to stop the scheme.It is a complicated issue, but one that will require Cunningham to spend more of her time in Washington.“The biggest worry for her is that the regulatory tailwinds are going the other way,” said Ronan Ryan, the president of IEX. Ryan, who runs a rival exchange that has been involved in a public spat with the NYSE over the fees study, says the NYSE is too dependent on the fees it charges for data and is on the wrong side over rebates.There is no air of crisis at the NYSE, which has dismissed IEX as an exchange with a “clearly failing” business model.And Cunningham does not believe the NYSE is in trouble. The financial world may be changing – and fast – but the NYSE remains the world’s most famous stock market. She is confident it can adapt and keep its pre-eminent position.“The future of equity markets is increasingly global, technology-focused and data-driven,” she said. In that world, she believes the NYSE “is uniquely positioned” to leverage its huge footprint, and technology, to stay ahead of the pack.On a brief tour of the recently refurbished NYSE – it looks like a particularly nice outpost of the luxury hotel chain W Hotel – we pop into a room full of portraits of past presidents – all pale males. One day, Cunningham will be up there, too. It is quite a first, even if she does not seem keen to acknowledge it. Perhaps Fearless Girl will ensure she is not the last."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e182418e75f5dcc53fa67c3d5876ec38b7aaba06/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=107adb03e87ac871133da6c2a7a8f820","title":"toblerone to revert to original shape but with bigger size and price","story":"Poundland will be forced to drop the chocolate bar as it will weigh 200g and cost £3Toblerone is reverting to its traditional shape after an outcry over a move to widen the gaps between the triangles – and push though a huge price rise at the same time.The 150g bar was reduced from 170g in 2016 as a way to keep prices steady at about £1 a bar. The gappy new version was likened to a bicycle rack. One retailing source said that the new 200g bar’s recommended selling price is £3.09, although big supermarkets and large retail chains will be able to sell the bars on promotion at £2-£2.50. The source described the change as a “backdoor price hike on shoppers”.At the time of the 2016 change Glenn Caton, president of the northern Europe ision of Toblerone’s parent company Mondelez, said that the wider gaps were only a “short-term solution” and “not the right thing for the long term because of the iconic nature of the product”.A Mondelez spokesperson said: “We’re always reviewing our range to make sure we provide great quality Swiss chocolate in formats we know our fans love. The 150g Toblerone is no longer being manufactured and therefore availability of the bar depends on how much stock an inidual retailer is carrying. But 100g and 360g size bars will still be available.”The change in shape and price, first reported by The Grocer trade journal, means that Poundland will no longer stock the bars. Toblerones are the discount chain’s most popular product and it sold 12m of them last year. Poundland said that stocks would run low within weeks.The discounter said it would respond by bringing back a redesigned version of Twin Peaks, its Toblerone copycat bar, at the end of the summer. Poundland sold half a million of the lookalikes earlier this year but has been forced to redesign it after a legal battle with the Swiss original’s owners.“Globally, chocolate consumption, especially that with high cocoa content, which is regarded as healthier, is up,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a1856e4b2e283e11af3364374039c9cee275f8c/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=437c92844c33b0ef4c1a8c3d3e9bba6c","title":"weak pound helps lure record number of overseas visitors to uk","story":"Fall in sterling since the Brexit vote seen as a factor in rise to nearly 40m visits last yearSterling’s plunge after the Brexit vote helped attract record numbers of overseas visitors to Britain last year, according to official figures.The Office for National Statistics said visits to the UK by overseas residents reached 39.2m last year, while also finding more Brits than ever before heading abroad – suggesting hopes for a staycation boom may have been overblown.Helping hotels, travel companies and tourist attractions across the country during a broader slowdown for the British economy in 2017, the number of visits by holidaymakers, business travellers and people coming to see friends and family rose from 37.6m in 2016.VisitBritain said the country benefited from higher numbers of people travelling from China, the US, Australia and the Gulf states, while overseas travellers opened their wallets to spend more than £24.5bn. While London remains the most popular destination, visits outside the capital reached a record high of 16.5m last year, with tourists spending £7.8bn in other UK locations.Aside from direct spending, the government’s tourism authority believes visitors to the UK generate a total of £127bn for the economy each year. Alongside the rise in numbers from further afield, there was also an increase in the number of Europeans coming to the UK. Europe remains the most important market for the British tourism industry, accounting for more than two-thirds of all visitors.France was the number one country for visits to the UK, with almost 4m last year.Despite significant pressure on household budgets, with Britons facing falling real wages and the highest levels of inflation for five years triggered by the Brexit vote, the ONS said more Brits than ever before jetted off on holiday, went on business trips or visited friends and family abroad.However, the weak pound does appear to have discouraged Brits from shelling out for long-haul trips to destinations like the US, with the figures showing the first drop in overall visits from Britain for several years. In the first year of Donald Trump’s presidency, visits from Britain fell to 3.4m, from almost 3.6m in 2016.Spain accounted for much of the increase in trips abroad, with visits to the most popular British holiday destination rising by more than a million to reach almost 15.9m last year. Holidaymakers and other British travellers spent more than £8.6bn in Spanish resorts, cities and regions last year.Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “It goes to show that even when we are tightening our belts, we are unwilling to give up our holidays.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18f9327029a24bb152cc84e957d1f6da0570becd/43_982_3554_2133/master/3554.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70ce164e352a47415db825eb0fcf95a5","title":"melancholy isolation pittsburghs parking lot attendants in pictures","story":"Given Pittsburgh’s poor public transport, many commuters choose to drive.

It was the title of a 1984 book by biologist Edward O Wilson, who claimed humans are genetically drawn to seek out and feel more zen in nature. In 2005, author Richard Louv proposed that not seeing your greens could cause Nature Deficit Disorder (NDD), a low-mood condition similar to Seasonal Affective Disorder (Sad).“Nature is good for us because humans are part of nature,” says Dr Miles Richardson, director of psychology at the University of Derby and founder of the Nature Connectedness Research Group. The science of why is down to a three circles model, where wellbeing is a delicately weighted balance between drive, contentment and threat. “Being constantly driven at work can mean our threat response is overactive, positive emotions are reduced, and we become anxious. Nature reduces sympathetic nervous activity associated with drive, and increases parasympathetic nervous activity associated with calm,” he says.  Relaxation comes whether you bathe in a forest or simply look at some roses – so it’s not necessarily being in nature that relaxes you, but feeling connected to it. “Simply noticing three good things in nature every day, such as a flower growing on the pavement, increases connectedness and, therefore, wellbeing,” adds Richardson. Light rightThere’s a reason that getting the window seat is such a big deal – it is, in fact, scientifically good for us. A study in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine found that sitting by a window during your working day results in 46 minutes more sleep every night.Where windows-for-all isn’t an option, architects are plugging into the new trend for circadian lighting: LED systems that mimic the angle and colour of the sun to sync with our bodies’ awake and sleep cycles. “Evolution has led us to expect a bluer light in the afternoon and a redder light in the morning and evening. Manufacturers are starting to produce systems with wavelengths to echo this,” explains Joe Croft, head of environmental and sustainability at Overbury, a wellbeing-focused fit-out firm. Air-ratedPolluted air doesn’t just create temporary physical symptoms such as problematic skin, and irritated eyes, nose and throat, it also contributes to the risk of chronic illnesses – but new tech is assisting the fightback against bad air. “The world’s first smartphone with air-quality sensors was released in February. Soon, more and more people will have the technology in their pocket to measure the quality of air around them,” says Croft. Colour of creativityThe psychology of shades has been a talking, dressing and wall-painting point ever since psychologist Angela Wright identified how colour influences our reactions back in 1984. Today, much of the focus is on how our environment spurs creativity. Sensory “triggers”, such as different textures of materials, are thought to keep the brain engaged, improving our ability to access knowledge. The significance of colour is also now thought to vary depending on where you are. According to the Human Spaces report, creativity is best boosted by green and purple colours in the UK, red design accents in India and water features in Brazil. Immersed in waterThe effect of urban water on wellbeing is the very latest area of environmental research. While the value of green space is in no doubt – the charity Fields in Trust equates the health benefit of the UK’s parks to around £34bn – water features, such as rivers, are less well examined. A special project will look at how 18,000 Europeans’ lives are influenced by water, meaning we could soon be splashing around a new buzzword: blue health.Look out for Clinique’s “purity patrol” fleet, carrying commuters around London, Manchester and Birmingham in air-purified rickshaws from 19-21 July.

The question was raised by the Hinkley Point power station, but is even more pressing in the telecoms business. Broadband internet is now as critical a part of the infrastructure as the road or rail network. So the question seems to answer itself. Many countries are extremely reluctant to allow two Chinese telecoms companies in particular, Huawei and ZTE, to do business with them. They view both of them as arms of the Chinese state, even though Huawei is legally a private company. In fact the US government nearly shut down ZTE altogether this year by forbidding its American component suppliers to deal with it, although it was later allowed to resume operations on payment of a $1bn fine. The British National Cyber Security Centre has already warned telecoms companies against the use of ZTE equipment or services.Huawaei had already abandoned the US market in 2013, but in the UK it has had a central position in BT’s broadband operation since 2010, having won its first contract in 2005. A 2013 report by the parliamentary intelligence and security committee was extremely critical of the way in which that deal had been nodded through without any ministerial input at all. Partly as a result, an arrangement was reached that allowed experts from GCHQ to examine the code in Huawei equipment used in Britain. The latest report from the oversight committee, which watches the progress of monitoring, suggests that there is more work to be done in some areas, mostly to do with third party components. This is not very alarmist language, and the company claims that it shows the process is working as designed. But it still reminds us of the inherent dangers of an obscure situation.There are numerous recorded cases of governments using routing equipment to spy on their enemies. In fact everyone does who can. In\u0026nbsp2014 the Snowden revelations included the detail that the NSA\u0026nbspwas tinkering with American routers destined for foreign countries to insert special spying equipment. The African Union headquarters in Addis\u0026nbspAbaba were built by the Chinese government and after five years’ operation were discovered to have been in surreptitious contact with servers in China for two hours every night, presumably reporting back everything that had been recorded by day. Nothing will stop these efforts, any more than any other kind of espionage can be entirely controlled. Security experts suggest that the precautions taken in Huawei’s case certainly make it more difficult for the Chinese state to hack into crucial systems. But\u0026nbspconstant vigilance is necessary, against human error as much as against deliberate malice. The\u0026nbspmodern world depends on complicated software interacting in complex and sometimes unforeseeable ways. Making that secure, and keeping it so, is a task as endless as painting the Forth Bridge – but increasingly essential."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/906278105bddc0dc05efab1beeb12416420c623f/1_0_4610_2767/master/4610.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=031245c7e3293643f471ef51e7717fbb","title":"denver nuggets where to eat and drink in colorados capital","story":"From the best pizza to the finest brewpubs, if there’s a restaurant or bar worth knowing in the Mile High City then chances are that local food doyen Kade Gianinetti has tried it out.

If we could just find those forms or the pieces of bureaucracy to remove, then the people before me would have done it. It’s a much more complex issue than that.”While teacher workload is not a new issue, Hinds said that recent developments, such as increased email contact with parents, data entry demands by school leaders and fashionable theories of “deep marking” – often in triplicate – had made matters worse for those at the chalkface.“Email makes contact from and with parents much more frequent and there can be an expectation of rapid response. All of us get this in our working lives, but when you are a teacher dealing with a classroom full of kids, with parents who have high expectations, then I think that pressure can be particularly great,” Hinds said.The DfE’s new workload toolkit will highlight schools that have got rid of onerous practices and policies such as lesson planning and data entry designed to minutely track pupil performance.Hinds has also pledged to end the constant cycle of reforms and tinkering from his own department that have caused extra workload for teachers.In the meantime he is trying to squeeze more funding out the Treasury, a task made more difficult by the early announcement of an additional £20bn for the NHS as a special case.“Education is a special case too. We’re responsible for helping parents, supporting them in the bringing up of the next generation,” Hinds said. “We’re responsible for helping to drive productivity, which drives economic growth. We need people to fill the jobs of the future, and some of those we can’t predict yet what they are, but we are also in the business of helping kids grow up into happy and fulfilled adults. So education is absolutely a special case.”After Labour was perceived as making education spending a vote-winner at the last election, Hinds was at pains to highlight his government’s record, pointing to the £1.3bn moved to hold per pupil funding for a further two years at a time when pupil numbers were growing.“Schools do manage their budgets very well. I recognise that budgets are tight – there have been particular cost pressures over the last two or three years. The work we’re doing on purchasing, on recruitment costs, on supply agencies and so on, that is to help managing cost pressures,” he said.The lack of an agreement with Treasury has probably delayed the DfE’s response to the teacher pay review panel’s recommendation. If no extra funds are forthcoming then any pay rise mandated by the DfE would have to come out of existing school budgets.On Friday the leaders of three education unions – the Association of School and College Leaders, the National Association of Head Teachers and the National Education Union – wrote to Hinds to complain the delay had left school budgets in limbo.“The impact of not fully funding the pay award will bring schools to crisis point and place our headteacher members in an invidious position, making it necessary to set deficit budgets and leading to schools becoming insolvent,” the unions said.But with parliament’s recess approaching, Hinds remains tight-lipped. “There is a process across government, and we are part-way through that process at the moment,” he said.Hinds was quick to praise teachers who have had to endure the overhaul of the curriculum and exam content for both GCSEs and A-levels. But he is convinced that the overhaul was needed because of years of grade inflation.“I think the system has responded incredibly well to the reforms, and we’ve see that coming through in the results. I don’t apologise for saying we should have high academic standards.”The tougher new exams are likely to have made exam season more fraught but Hinds regards that as part of their purpose. “Part of school, a big part, is about preparing young people for the reality of life, which does have its ups and its down. Ultimately we do need to have examinations.”But he said exam stress did not belong in primary schools.“When we talk about national assessments, at the end of primary school, it’s really, really not good to be putting pressure on children for those. Those are not public exams in the sense that the results are going to stay with you in later life.”The government’s policy of allowing grammar schools to expand, for the first time in many years, has attracted controversy. But Hinds said their expansion made up only a fraction of the growth seen across secondary schools as pupil numbers rose.Critics maintain that children from disadvantaged families struggle to gain admission to grammar schools, often denied the advantages of parental support and private tutoring of their better-off peers. But Hinds has a blunt warning for grammars wanting a slice of the Department for Education’s £50m expansion fund: “A simple measure is kids on free school meals – I want to see more kids on free school meals at grammar schools.”The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: “Thanks to campaigning by teachers across the country, ministers have finally conceded that their workloads have now become unacceptable.“The best thing the government could do for teachers’ morale is commit to new funding to give our teachers the pay rise they deserve and schools the resources they need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74987334b1c64cb7ee79d11aa012f97e0ba175c5/0_95_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5948c8a07ecb7e67c8ff73748f95b4cc","title":"formerly extinct ibis taught to migrate by following light aircraft","story":"Birds bred in captivity led on three-week migration south from Germany by human ‘foster parents’Leaning out of an ultralight aircraft, Corinna Esterer turns toward a flock of peculiar black birds soaring just a few metres away. “Come, come ibis,” she yells through her megaphone.

But recently, it has celebrated a slow but steady comeback thanks to human foster parents who have shown the birds how to migrate south by leading the way in ultralight aircraft.This year is the fifth time the team has taken young birds that hatched in captivity on a three-week migration across the Alps to their wintering grounds in Tuscany.More than 100 iniduals now live independently in southern Germany and Austria. The first generations have already bred in the wild, and taught their offspring the same migratory path they learned from their human parents. Preparations for this year’s migration started when the foster parents took in 31 chicks at the Vienna zoo when they were just a few days old. They were fed 10 times a day and began to recognise the women feeding them as parents, before they were taken to their training camp at Lake Constance several weeks later.Fritz said he drew inspiration from the 1996 film Fly Away Home in which one character, Amy, flies an ultralight aircraft to show a flock of orphaned geese their migratory path. At the time of the movie’s release, Fritz was working on his PhD at a behavioural science research institute that had started to work with northern bald ibis chicks born in a zoo. Despite having only survived in zoos for centuries the young birds’ instinct to migrate kicked in, and in August they tried to fly south. But without an elder bird to guide them, they died along the way. “When we saw the movie, we joked that we could do what Amy was doing with the geese,” Fritz said.Following a feasibility study that took 10 years, the project received more than €4m (about half of it from the EU) to establish a viable population in the wild. That critical point has been reached, Fritz said, but the benefits go beyond just the reintroduction of the birds. Using GPS trackers on the birds’ backs, the team has managed to better understand how migratory birds save energy by flying in their typical V-formation.Research is also under way to understand when and how the ibis decided to swap positions within the V-formation. And in the future, human-led migration might have to help with the reintroduction of other migratory birds, which are under threat worldwide mostly due to loss of habitat, but also because of collisions with glass buildings, electric poles and wires.For now, however, the main worry is getting the birds to follow the aircraft. While they have a strong bond with their “mothers” and follow them around on the ground, flying is more difficult, Fritz said.On a recent afternoon, only half of the flock followed the aircraft, while the other half was so confused that they simply returned to their aviary looking for their parent. “They don’t totally get yet when their parents are sitting in there,” Fritz said as he pushed the aircraft – essentially a metal cage with two small seats, a propeller and a parachute – back into a small shelter. “But one day, just like that, it clicks. And then, we can take them to Tuscany.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23f610254e38cc7f11b03e7517ab9754a89c5831/0_546_3490_2094/master/3490.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76c0e45c835335ab29e0c484f763e92c","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A newly discovered bandy bandy snake species, jumping sweetfish and baby tarantulas in Derbyshire are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7477d0e0ae11750fbb2439c4fa6908716322dcc0/1053_1147_1575_945/master/1575.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3d057c05023b7ba164895234b3478c9","title":"how to wear denim jacket jess cartner morley","story":"The denim jacket is fundamentally unimprovable, so never really changes, which is brilliantThis is not about whether you should buy a denim jacket you already have one. Check the boot of the car. Or that overloaded coat hook by the back door. Told you! The only reason you wouldn’t have one is if you listened to misguided people who tell you to detox your wardrobe and get rid of all the useful stuff in favour of obscure capsule “pieces” that are then deemed over six months later.The denim jacket is the opposite of a statement jacket. It is so far from being a “piece” that it’s almost invisible, in the same way that a pair of jeans almost disappears from view in a fashion context. It is functional and familiar and essential. You take for granted that it will be there when you need it, like ketchup for your fish and chips. The denim jacket is fundamentally unimprovable, so never really changes, which is brilliant, except that means it never feels terrifically exciting.But there is every reason to rekindle your love for the denim jacket. It is the perfect weight for a summer jacket, sturdy enough to keep out a stiff breeze, cool enough not to overcook you. And it doesn’t crease or snag or even look obviously dirty.But much more important than its practical qualities are its style attributes. A denim jacket is not smart, but neither is it silly. It is neither too masculine nor too feminine, but brings balance to whatever you wear it with. (See the tomboyishness it lends to a very feminine aesthetic: Nigella used to wear that look to great effect see also Marilyn Monroe in The Misfits.) It is also pleasingly youthful without being overly teenage. A floral dress that could look stuffily grown-up with wedges loses a decade if you wear it with a denim jacket and flat white trainers.Denim on denim gets a bad press, but it’s easier to wear if you mix up the colours and weights. Dark denim with white has a summery, nautical vibe that feels less deliberately hipsterish than Spears-and-Timberlake blue-on-blue. The classic blue is the number one choice if you are after an ugly trainerdad-core look, but I’m happy to pare things back to summer basics by teaming denim with gingham, broderie anglaise, white Converse. An indigo denim jacket is smarter than the traditional version, especially if the shape is neat. It’s also more all-weather, visually speaking: you can wear it with a black cotton turtleneck and black ankle-grazer trousers for an easing-into-autumn look. Perhaps you do need to buy one, after all.Styling: Melanie Wilkinson. Hair and makeup: Johanni Nel at S Management.

Both happened this week, as 20-year-old Kylie Jenner headed up an issue dedicated to America’s female billionaires, her pristine face accompanied by a slobbering headline declaring the celebrity cosmetics entrepreneur “the youngest-ever self-made billionaire”.The response wasn’t exactly the surge of youth approval the editors were angling for, as scores of social media sceptics rightly queried the magazine’s definition of “self-made”: it is, after all, a tad easier to make yourself when you’re born into vast, Olympic-gilded fame and fortune of the extended Jenner-Kardashian clan. “Welcome to the era of extreme fame leverage,” the magazine continued, in somewhat contradictory fashion: on Planet Forbes, it seems, fame is merely a baseline from which to pull yourself up by your bootstraps. I thought of that ill-judged front page repeatedly as I watched Generation Wealth, photographer-film-maker Lauren Greenfield’s sprawling, discursive, largely frustrating attempt to parse the roots, symptoms and often grotesque fallout of late capitalism – a notional expansion of ideas explored in her excellent 2012 doc The Queen of Versailles, a venom-tinged portrait of the massively wealthy resort barons David and Jackie Siegel and their obscene material excesses. Had Greenfield made Generation Wealth a year later, the Jenner cover might well have slipped into its busy collage of high-gloss images, most of them the photographer’s own. We do, however, get a shot of Jenner’s half-sister Kim Kardashian, aged 12, as part of an affluent, precociously glamorous school clique – one of the many Hollywood kids whose extreme privilege (squandered in some cases, lavishly capitalised upon in others) Greenfield, herself a Los Angeles native, pores over with a furrowed brow.Yet the name “Donald Trump” is scarcely uttered in Generation Wealth, while the orange menace makes but two fleeting appearances in Greenfield’s collective montage of American capitalist rot – once in footage from a 2016 Trump rally, in which the faces of the aforementioned Siegels can be spotted grinning ghoulishly behind him. Perhaps Greenfield reasoned that Trump is so obvious an emblem of America’s dangerous monetary fixation that her condemnation of him goes without saying. That said, as Trump’s most ardent Republican followers refuse to be moved even by his farcical siding with the Russian government on matters of electoral interference, this may not be the best moment in history for leaving things unsaid.Instead, Generation Wealth focuses on a disparate range of human subjects lower down the capitalist totem pole, running the gamut from louche former investment banker Florian Homm – in plush German exile to avoid fraud conviction in the US – to relative have-nots like Cathy Grant, a working-class bus driver plunged into unmanageable debt and family tragedy after she travelled to Brazil for drastically transformational plastic surgery. The thematic thread of capitalist collusion and corruption running through such interviewees – to say nothing of the Trumps and Kardashians drawn implicitly into its thesis – is slender enough before Greenfield turns the lens increasingly on herself. The film’s second half, in particular, is preoccupied with the film-maker’s own personal and familial insecurities, as she wonders aloud if her own dedication to her rich, substantial, globe-trotting photography career – at the expense of being a more sacrificing, nurturing presence for her husband and two sons – can itself be aligned with the self-serving, money-grubbing principles of late capitalism.It’s a disappointingly off-base and surprisingly conservative line of inquiry for a film that often comes tantalisingly close to a more acerbic diagnosis of the mass moral ruin that brought on the Trump era – one that directs more lurid judgment toward the pawns of so-called Generation Wealth than its primary enablers and beneficiaries. Meanwhile, as the film’s focus narrows to Greenfield’s reasonably well-moneyed struggle to balance her duties as artist, career woman and parent, Generation Wealth falls into its own narcissistic trap, prioritising the inidual over the village: its finale celebrates the production of Greenfield’s accompanying book of the same title.That the volume in question is the kind of heavy, shiny, coffee-table tome likely only to grace the tables of the wealthy is an irony of which the film may or may not be aware. You could say something similar, perhaps, for Forbes’s lauding of Kylie Jenner’s “self-made” billions. Either way, it’ll take more than this kind of guarded ambiguity to cut to the heart of Trump’s America."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71e91b14ee4ff6565e9e8b3888d3cb2190d3cbeb/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f4ae334a28c03a312cfc05c2e8b4cd0","title":"sorry to bother you boots riley","story":"A rip-roaring tale of code-switching and capitalism, it’s the most significant state-of-the-nation satire since Jordan Peele’s masterpiece It is a symbolic narrative that will be familiar to fans of Get Out: the one way for black people to truly succeed in a white world is to become, figuratively and literally, white. In many ways, Sorry to Bother You is very much a post-Get Out experience, despite the fact that Riley had been trying to make the film for many years (the screenplay was published in full in McSweeney’s Quarterly in 2014). “Unfortunately, the world hasn’t changed enough to make the movie irrelevant,” he told the audience at this year’s Sundance, where the film picked up the much deserved Vanguard award. “It’s of the time and the movement going on right now.” Both films are genre-blending comedy-horrors addressing heavy concepts such as systemic racism and oppression, the theft and repossession of black bodies by white America, the dark reality of labour in capitalist society and the way in which these villainous forces are disguised. Like Jordan Peele’s instant classic, Sorry to Bother You (directed by musician-turned-director Boots Riley) is a “social thriller” (a term first coined by Peele) where the villain is not just one person or family, but an insidious idea at the root of society itself.These movies ask the viewer: what if you found out you were living in silent solidarity with the most diabolical villains ever? Would you recognise it and would you do something about it? In Sorry to Bother You, Riley observes the many ways in which capitalism (and the forces that uphold it) manipulates, controls and ultimately destroys the inidual.Although Sorry to Bother You could be perceived as an allegory for slavery, the movie doesn’t poke at white guilt or mine it for punchlines as much as Get Out (remember Rose’s father: “I would’ve voted for Obama a third time, if I could”). Instead, with wit and wackiness, it scratches around at the idea of how readily we are all willing to ignore the obvious horror in front of our faces at all times.Set in Oakland, California, where writer-director Riley was born and lived for 30 years, the theme of rising rent, lower wages and fewer careers couldn’t be more relevant. Oakland and San Francisco are among the most expensive cities to live in the US, by a considerable margin. Cassius takes the telemarketing job out of desperate economic necessity: he is down and out and living in his uncle’s garage with his girlfriend (Tessa Thompson). Stanfield had previously appeared as the unsettlingly bodysnatched Andre in Get Out (“I find that the African-American experience for me has been for the most part very good”) but here his “white voice” is played for laughs: a code-switching nod to the likes of Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy who both did “white voice” in their standup routines, exposing some uneasy truths. In Sorry to Bother You, Glover’s Langston spells it out for Cassius: his “white voice” succeeds because it sounds like wealth – a cadence that rings with a happy-go-lucky economic solvency. “In America, you see people who are code-switching all the time,” says US writer and broadcaster Touré, “not to become some sort of Oreo but being able to adopt that sort of white voice to make white people feel comfortable and then being able to switch back and speak to black audiences and send the message of: ‘I’m still one of you.’ You see that in Barack Obama, you see that in Oprah Winfrey. I’ve never seen a film that deals with code-switching in such a great, subversive way. It’s important and valuable but also problematic and fraught with pitfalls.”The film’s “of its time” satire feels starker and more batshit than Get Out, too, possibly due to its timing. Although Peele’s film has been seen as a icy comment on Donald Trump, it was made in the Obama era and released in the States only a few days after Trump’s inauguration. Sorry to Bother You comes out at a very different time, in an era of child separations, the continued visibility of the “alt-right” and a toxicity around the word “immigrant”.Indeed, the stakes are naturally much higher for any “social thriller” that comes out post-Trump’s first year (see also: The First Purge). Speaking on the theme, Peele told Business Insider last year: “The best and scariest monsters in the world are human beings and what we are capable of especially when we get together.” His forthcoming film Us, featuring warring couples, one black (Lupita Nyong’o, Winston Duke) and one white (Elisabeth Moss, Tim Heidecker) follows this blueprint. “I’ve been working on these premises about these different social demons, these innately human monsters that are woven into the fabric of how we think and how we interact,” he said. This is where Sorry to Bother You is coming from, forming part of the “movement” Riley speaks about. In a New York Times profile of Stanfield, he is singled out alongside the likes of Donald Glover, Issa Rae and by implication Janelle Monáe, creatives who subvert the normal tropes assigned to black stars in the public sphere. “(Stanfield)’s interested in being weird and holding that space that, particularly for artists of color, hasn’t always been accessible,” Stanfield’s co-star Thompson told the NYT: “The folks that take that and own that, those outliers, are remarkable, and really important culturally.”In these terms Sorry to Bother You can be seen a victory lap both Stanfield and Riley have taken a cinematic universe most associated with surreal white auteurs such as Wes Anderson, Michel Gondry and Spike Jonze and repurposed it for an all-black cast and world in the same way that Get Out reignited the horror genre by bringing ersity into the room. By the normal rules of Hollywood, an oddball character actor such Stanfield would be relegated to a “kooky best friend” role, but in Riley’s universe he’s the lead. “To see this epic allegory about race is interesting,” says Touré. “In America we are constantly talking about race, even when we’re pretending that we’re not talking about race.” Sorry to Bother You is in cinemas soon "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/284ee5a4ce68d96fe20c418c8a5987464093d269/56_24_1684_1011/master/1684.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80ee154b10be84417d233ce513584497","title":"maurizio sarri fun times chelsea","story":"When Claudio Ranieri first arrived in the Premier League, he caused a minor stir because of his inability to speak to the media in English. “Ranieri finds trouble in translation” was the headline in the  after Chelsea lost to Everton in November 2000, which goes to show how tough it was for the affable Italian during his early days as an outsider in a strange and suspicious country.The man who would eventually lead Leicester City to the title was the Manuel to English football’s Basil Fawlty, raising the hackles with his inability to communicate with players and supporters. Yet at least Ranieri’s insistence on speaking to the media in Italian gave rise to one of the great comedy episodes. The story goes that when Ranieri had finished giving a detailed three-minute answer, his interpreter would nod and say “It’s a game of two halves” in English.Whether or not this is an urban myth is not entirely clear. But let’s agree that it definitely did happen given that the tale came to mind when Chelsea’s media team had to correct a couple of mistranslations after Maurizio Sarri’s unveiling at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. Sarri had introduced himself to the English media in Italian, just like Ranieri did back in the day, and the interpreter had made one or two small errors.Point No\u0026nbsp1: when Chelsea’s new manager revealed that he wanted to add “a pinch of quality” in central defence, he had actually mentioned central midfield. Makes sense, I thought, my mind drifting back to the February evening when Tiémoué Bakayoko played as though his shoelaces were tied together during a 4-1 defeat by Watford, the January evening when Antonio Conte looked at Ross Barkley as if he was a piece of pineapple on a pizza and the September evening when Chelsea completed their Danny Drinkwater coup.Moving on, then, point No\u0026nbsp2 referred to the moment when Sarri appeared to suggest that entertaining defeats can be more enjoyable than boring wins. Here was a reminder of how much language matters, how one slip of the tongue can alter our impression of a manager before he has even taken charge of his first game. It was the kind of comment with the potential to make José Mourinho add Sarri’s name to his big book of Poets, Philosophers and Other Romantic Losers. In red ink. And capital letters.What Sarri had actually tried to get across was that fun and winning should go hand in hand. Yet even that sounded strange, if only because football can be such a serious business. In fact, there were a few times when I had to check my headphones to make sure I was hearing correctly, not least when Sarri announced that the transfer market bores him and he prefers to develop his players with good coaching. A check with Chelsea’s press officer confirmed that the former Napoli manager had not demanded that Roman Abramovich buy him Neymar for £500m and a pair of gold shoes.Sarri is different. The 59-year-old is a former banker who never played professionally and, although he is yet to win any trophies, there is a reason he has developed close friendships with Pep Guardiola and Arrigo Sacchi. “Ours is not a sport but a game,” he said. “Anybody who plays a game started doing it as a child for fun and the child in us must be nurtured because this often makes us the best. To create play that is fun is the first thing to obtain a style for a high-level squad.”That beautiful, refreshing sentiment was not said for effect. Sarri meant every word, proof that he is not afraid to stand out from the crowd. Conte liked to talk about the need to work hard. His successor’s buzzword is “fun”.Admittedly that can make Sarri sound a little like an enthusiastic children’s party entertainer whose sunny world view is about to be crushed by a room of screaming brats and tired parents, while there is a strong chance that a slow start would leave him vulnerable to being dismissed as an overly cheery fraud who must adopt a win-at-all-costs mentality. Look how Guardiola was received after his first year in England.The refusal to conform can make people uncomfortable and it is debatable if a manager with Sarri’s track record will succeed in his quest to lighten the mood at Chelsea. On the one hand he could be an inspired appointment. On the other we could be six months away from the damning articles about where it all went wrong. “At first Maurizio had a smile on his face every day,” a top inside source will say. “But you could see he was losing the will to live when David Luiz kept responding to everything he said by sticking his fingers in his ears and shouting ‘La La La La’.”Chelsea, who are having an uncertain summer, might have to accept that their reinvention as the freewheeling Funtime Sarris will take time. Encouragingly, however, there are signs that the tone of the conversation is changing. Suspicion has become less fashionable than a willingness to engage with fresh ideas, empathy a more desirable and modern quality than attention-seeking abrasiveness.More than anything, the reaction to England’s World Cup run showed that people crave a connection with their team. Almost 20 years after the chuckles at Ranieri’s expense, English football is prepared for a new way of talking. Listen closely enough and it might put a smile on your face."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a584f70885b9b2b8fe6472d2df52b977a24909bc/0_1241_4241_2543/master/4241.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db2a43d7065d2ed9695bf443d5b48d30","title":"must be moment feel that you are an adult","story":"Adulthood is still one of life’s great mysteries to me, like who built the pyramidsYou’d think that writing a column about becoming a\u0026nbspgrownup would give me an insight into what lies ahead.

Things were so grim the town received a handout in 2012 after being picked as a Portas pilot, named after TV retail guru Mary Portas whose high street review was prompted by the wave of store closures that followed the post-credit crunch recession.Clarkson took charge of the Conservative-controlled council in 2013, and inherited a town that was “living in the past”. “Nothing was happening here,” he says.These days, it’s a different story. “We mean business,” says Clarkson, banging his fists on the table as he describes a commercial culture that has seen the council move aggressively into buying property in order to regenerate its city centre. “I said we had to stop crying in our beer and plan how to become independent.”“It’s not just about shopping,” says Clarkson, referring to council investments that include the £75m Elwick Place development, which will bring a Travelodge and six-screen Picturehouse cinema to the town, later this year. “You have got to create a civic heartbeat so that everybody is proud to live here.”The council offered independent retailers flexible terms to fill the empty shops in Park Mall, an approach that helped Made in Ashford, which sells the wares of local artisans, establish itself. Opposite the shop is Emporia Fabric \u0026amp Craft, a trendy store that sells fabrics and runs sewing workshops. A new bridal store has also recently moved in. Councils around Britain are grappling with the fallout from changing shopping patterns that could leave 100,000 shops lying empty within a decade, according to the recent Grimsey 2 report. Bill Grimsey, the former Wickes and Iceland chief executive who was revisiting his influential 2013 review, warned: “We have to accept that there is already too much retail space in the UK and that bricks and mortar retailing can no longer be the anchor for thriving high streets and town centres.”Ashford is seeing an influx of investment, including a new craft beer brewery from the owners of the Chapel Down winery, and it has not gone unnoticed by the government. It has seen more than 35,000 high street jobs disappear this year after a string of retailers and restaurant groups, including Mothercare, Carpetright, New Look, Prezzo and Jamie’s Italian, announced plans to close hundreds of outlets. On Thursday, it was confirmed that Poundworld, which had 5,000 staff, is to disappear altogether.To that end, the high street minister,Jake Berry, has drafted in Graham Galpin, a senior Ashford councillor who has been a key figure in its regeneration, to a new expert panel that will review the root causes of high street decline and try to come up with some answers.In Ashford, the council is already looking to relax planning policy to allow a broader range of property use within the town centre and Galpin, who read the Grimsey report with interest, suggests councils need to overcome their “fear of the future”. Officials in towns in the north east and north west of England, who have the highest percentage of long-term empty shops, could argue Ashford has some natural advantages, not least the high speed rail line that whisks locals into central London in just over half an hour, fuelling a house price boom. Paris is under two hours away. “The train line is the critical thing we have that others don’t but if you go 20 miles south you hit Folkestone, which has the seafront and the beauty of that,” says Andrew Osborne, Ashford’s economic development manager. “It’s about utilising your natural assets. We’re dealing with the same issues as every other town in Kent.”Park Mall has focused on fostering independent retailers because it has the much larger County Square mall, home to major chains such Debenhams and Marks \u0026amp Spencer, as competition on its doorstep. But from Debenhams’ first floor cafe you can also see the meringue-like canopy of the Richard Rogers-designed McArthurGlen Designer Outlet where diggers are scraping out the foundations of a £90m extension that will add 50 stores and create a destination to rival the pull of the successful Bicester Village designer discount mall in Oxfordshire.While Ashford bought Park Mall for a six-figure sum, other councils have gone on to do much bigger retail deals, which some analysts consider a worrying trend. Canterbury’s council took control of the Whitefriars shopping centre for £75m while Shropshire county council has spent just over £50m on three shopping centres in Shrewsbury.Given Ashford’s focus on revitalising the town centre, the council’s decision to permit the 100,000 sq ft expansion of the McArthurGlen centre seems counterintuitive even if there are strict controls over the brands that can move in. But given shoppers head to the outlet to stock up on cut price Calvin Kleins, Barbour jackets and Diesel jeans, the council argues it will help the economy and not destroy its good work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/604ad61332ee65d3e71133edb0c19babc8d1b298/0_73_1732_1039/master/1732.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f60de76ef032bd89e591f3b5996cc427","title":"the plays the thing five fabulous audio dramas not to miss this summer","story":"With audio content exploding in popularity, a raft of gripping stories told by multiple narrators is just a few clicks away. Coco Khan picks out some of the bestA conversation can speak volumes and in the world of audio dramas, they often do. The audio drama – a piece of fiction told using several voices – is in the midst of a renaissance. Previously consigned to rare radio slots on rainy Sundays, audio dramas are now ubiquitous, buoyed by audience tastes for podcasts, and attracting some of the world’s most exciting writers and actors.These are professional, high-quality productions – think Netflix for your ears. And like Netflix, Audible has begun commissioning original audio dramas, making them free for members, putting an end to the bottleneck in which many creatives vie for one radio slot (and a broadcaster therefore has to pick the one with broadest appeal). Audio dramas run the gamut, whether you want a tear-jerking tragedy, an edge-of-your-seat thriller, or a heart-fluttering romance. With such variety, they make for perfect accompaniments to your summer holidays, whether you’ve got a long-haul backpacking trip planned, or a short and swift city break lined up.But with so many options, where do you begin?We picked out five of the best audio dramas from Audible, so you don’t have to. All you have to worry about is whether or not you can resist binge-listening your weekend away.The Child “My name is Simon. I’m 10 years old. I’m a serial killer.” So begins Sebastian Fitzek’s chilling tale of a boy who claims to have killed in a previous life. Set in Berlin, the story follows the child and the only people who believe his cryptic utterings – his mother and a lawyer she has hired. But when Simon’s knowledge leads to several bodies being discovered, the police start to suspect the lawyer. He must solve the crimes before the police put him in the frame, no matter what it takes. Fitzek is one of Germany’s most lauded crime-thriller writers and has seen his work translated into 20 languages. His talents are at their height in this intricate, spine-tingling adaptation. The fabulous narrators include Emilia Fox (Polanski’s The Pianist) and Rupert Penry-Jones (Spooks).Northanger Abbey If audio dramas are having a renaissance, Northanger Abbey might be the Sistine Chapel. A slick, star-studded adaptation of Jane Austen’s classic, this ambitious production has redefined audio storytelling – which is to be expected, given the cast. National treasure and Bafta award-winning actress Emma Thompson tops the bill, bringing Austen’s dry wit to life, while supporting performances from Lily Cole and Jeremy Irvine elevate the series to GOAT (greatest of all time) level. This coming-of-age story follows 17-year-old Catherine Morland through love, danger and intrigue, satirising the gothic tales that were popular at the time of writing, while taking a shrewd look at the British class system. Such skewering of high society feels as fresh as ever. Even those put off by historical drama will find joy in this.Neverwhere Nobody anticipated the impact the BBC’s 2013 adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s cult novel by the same name would have. Broadcast over six days, the production was a smash hit with Gaiman fans and non-fans alike, propelling the audio play into the public eye and showing just how exciting the form can be. Download to listen to Benedict Cumberbatch, David Harewood, James McAvoy and Natalie Dormer telling the story of Richard Mayhew, the unassuming Londoner who finds himself in London Below, a magical version of – and coexisting with – the real city, known as London Above. Originally conceived as a television series, Neverwhere lends itself to episodes, and so its separation into six parts feels natural and seamless. And on Audible it includes over 25 minutes of additional unbroadcasted material, including extended scenes, bloopers and outtakes.Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book: The Mowgli Stories One for the slightly older kids (and also the parents), The Mowgli Stories brings together all of Kipling’s tales about the boy raised by animals in the jungle. Though the average listener might think they know all there is to know about Mowgli from the much-loved Disney film, his adventure takes many more twists and turns. This retelling of the timeless classic stays true to Kipling’s darker side and the well-known cast, including comedian Bill Bailey and actors Richard E Grant and Celia Imrie, make this one unforgettable audio drama. A must-listen for anyone who has seen the film, and a brilliant, truthful, introduction to the work of Kipling for those who haven’t.Locke \u0026amp Key One of Audible’s first forays into commissioning original audio dramas is still among the most ambitious undertakings the form has seen. Locke \u0026amp Key began life as a graphic novel – so translating the form from highly visual to solely audio was no small feat. To do so, Audible drafted in Locke \u0026amp Key’s creators, Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez, to ensure the adaptation stayed true to its dark, terrifying roots. And it worked, assisted no doubt by the voice of scream queen Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black) and Haley Joel Osment of “I see dead people” fame. Locke \u0026amp Key follows a family who, starting over after a tragedy, set themselves up in a quiet town that is also frequented by demons. A sharp production that will have you jumping out of your skin and sleeping with one eye open.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible - £7.99 a month after 30 days.

Two years later, she is a major-label rapper. She talks about the friends she lost along the way – and her fight for credibilityIn September 2016, Danielle Bregoli – then 13 years old – flicked her straightened hair over her shoulder and pursed her lips while someone referred to her as the antichrist. Dr Phil, on whose family-counselling TV show she was appearing, was insisting she was not the antichrist her exasperated mother described. So far, so daytime television. But unlike many of the “tearaway teens” stereotyped on shows such as this, Bregoli has grafted the beginnings of a career on to this wobbly scaffolding.If her name is not familiar, you may be aware of her rap alias, Bhad Bhabie, or “cash me ousside”. That catchphrase – a threat to “take this outside”, aimed at the studio audience that was laughing at her – has since become a meme and, for some, a crude summation of her character. “People have this misconception that I’m going to beat them up when I meet them,” the 15-year-old says now. “But it’s like … no. Just ’cause I stand up for myself and I’m honest, that doesn’t mean I’m going to beat people up all the time.”Hearing her speak, Bregoli could be anything from a 12-year-old – when we first meet, she is screeching at her manager about how her hair makes her look homeless – to a jaded 42-year-old, sighing world-wearily. But she is most certainly a child, one introduced to the world on TV thanks to her mother’s distress about her criminal adolescent behaviour (car theft, knife threats, what Bregoli describes as a proximity to drug dealers).Her foray into rap has led to a major-label record deal, a handful of buzzy singles and a US and European tour. Her tracks are often brilliant in their withering focus: Hi Bich bounces along on a belly-shaking trap beat, punctuated by an earworming shopping-list chorus: “White Js, white Porsche  White wrist, white horse  Hi, bitch  Hi, bitch  Hi, bitch  Hi, bitch.” Nearly 15 million people follow her on Instagram. At the centre of this is a girl who oscillates between two personas: the remnants of the primary-school-aged child photographed cheek to cheek with her single mum and the potty-mouthed teen who, on returning to Dr Phil’s sofa last year, told him: “You were nothin’ before I came on this show.”In many ways, Bregoli is a regular kid. In an east London hotel room, she sits curled up in a chair in front of her half-eaten macaroni and cheese and rolls her eyes while talking about boys. She remembers how her close friends, 21-year-old YouTuber model twins Elijah and Isaac Bell, had tried to get her chatting to someone her age, after most of her female friendships fell apart.“And they were like: ‘OK, well, how about this person?’ He was 16. So I start texting him and he was so corny. Saying: ‘What do you wanna talk about?’ What? Is this fourth grade? And then he was all: ‘Do you send pictures?’” – meaning provocative selfies. “Nope, goodbye! Conversation ended and you’re blocked.” She pauses. “And it was like, all right, I don’t have female friends or guy friends or a boyfriend. Well, I’m screwed.” She scoffs. “Pfft. Teen boys are a huge mess.”The day we meet, she is easing into downtime between shows and has shed her usual armour of false lashes and acrylic nail extensions. Barefaced, she throws back her head and laughs one second, then mock-scowls and picks at the rips in her jeans the next. Overall, she comes across as a sweet girl, if perhaps one who may look back in 10 years and cringe at quotes she gave to journalists, some twice her age – or wonder why those adults seemed to want to provoke her.Her words tumble over themselves when she is excited, as though her mouth is playing catchup to a mind moving at a few hundred miles a minute. Case in point: how jaded she sounds when talking about the mechanics of the music business, with less than a year’s experience of it. She launches into several big-name stars, claiming that if people think they wrote their big hits “they’re out of their fucking minds. Half these motherfuckers don’t write shit. And if I did have a ghostwriter … what’s the problem?”If she sounds defensive, that is likely because plenty of observers online – in hip-hop and entertainment more broadly – saw her music as a joke, even as it was becoming enormously popular. Atlantic signed Bregoli in September 2017, after releasing her debut single, These Heaux, in late August. Hi Bich followed and its joint video with her track Whachu Know has racked up more than 100m views on YouTube. All of Bregoli’s singles so far jostle her forward as one of the few young women associated with the US crop of lyrically simplistic, goofy and sometimes arguably violent SoundCloud rappers.She has cultivated friendships with labelmates Lil Skies and YoungBoy Never Broke Again, as well as red-braided collaborator Lil Yachty (he appears on 2018’s Gucci Flip Flops, the title rhymed with “hit your bitch in my socks”). She understands that she is an anomaly in their world, a white child seeming to attach herself to a historically black genre. Her whiteness gives her the privilege of a second chance at being “good” and jars with her drawling Florida-plus-Brooklyn accent. But the sweary brashness is not an act, she insists. “I’m just me, all the time. People think: ‘She must be an innocent little white girl when she’s not performing or making videos.’ But no, I’m me all year round, 247. There’s a softer and harder person in everyone, depending on the time. I’m not gonna walk in a church and say: ‘Wassup bitches?’ No.” She pauses for effect. “I might say it, but it’s gonna be quiet.”Raised in south Florida’s Boynton Beach area, Bregoli says she was a difficult infant. “I had this little Barbie Jeep and used to flick off the nothing behind me because I’d watch my mum do it in her car. I’ve always been a little brat annoying child. I think I’m always gonna be a nightmare, for sure.” Even so, she was friendly with a couple of girls as a pre-teen, around the time when she shared a bed with her mother, who was living with a cancer diagnosis.“And that’s where my life kinda went ...” She motions the swift downward path of a falling jet, blowing a raspberry with her lips. Bregoli had fallen in with one young girl who “got me into selling drugs and doing really stupid shit. I really cared about her, I believed she was a good person, but … she wasn’t.” Now Bregoli sees the time she and her ex-friend spent off the rails as a part of growing up.“It’s not, like, a phase,” she says, tugging at her high ponytail. “I don’t think you call stealing cars and selling drugs a phase.” She chuckles drily. “I think that’s more of … ‘I’m bored, let me figure out something to do.’ I would still do that now if I wanted to, but I don’t. If I’m handed a fucking music career, yeah, I’m gonna stop doing dumb shit and do that instead.”Given how quickly she fell into rap, I ask whether she plans to stick with music for the long haul. She slows down, sounding well aware of how swiftly 15 minutes of meme-induced fame can slip through your fingers. “I definitely do wanna keep doing it – if it were up to me. But if other opportunities come along the way, then, you know …” What about the reality show rumours? She won’t commit. “If I do a reality show, it’d have to be around music. I started something, so I’m gonna … well, not finish it, actually – I’m gonna keep doing it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d94c05ec8ff7b35ca43d0ffef91b98f934b558c/130_0_4126_2475/master/4126.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14c4bcf4d130fdb9c4fe3abbd59ff5b0","title":"when is a nation not a nation somalilands dream of independence","story":"When you are in Somaliland, there is never any question that you are in a real country. After all, the place has all the trappings of countryhood. When I arrived at the airport, a customs officer in a Somaliland uniform checked my Somaliland visa, issued by the Somaliland consulate in Washington DC. At the airport, there was a Somaliland flag. During my visit, I paid Somaliland shillings to drivers of cabs with Somaliland plates who took me to the offices of ministers of the Somaliland government.But, according to the US Department of State, the United Nations, the African Union and every other government on Earth, I was not in Somaliland, a poor but stable and mostly functional country on the Horn of Africa. I was in Somalia.Even among unrecognised states, Somaliland is a special case – it is both completely independent and politically entirely isolated. Unlike South Sudan before its independence, Somaliland’s claim for statehood is based not on a redrawing of colonial borders, but an attempt to re-establish them. Unlike Taiwan, it is shackled not to a richer, more powerful country, but a poorer, weaker one. Unlike Palestine, its quest for independence is not a popular cause for activists around the world.The journalist Graeme Wood has described places such as Somaliland as the “limbo world”: entities that “start by acting like real countries, and then hope to become them”. What separates “real” from “self-proclaimed” countries is simply the recognition of other countries. There’s no ultimate legal authority in international relations that decides what is or isn’t a real country, and differences of opinion on that question are common. What separates the Somalilands of the world from, say, Sweden is that Sweden is recognised by its peers.Statehood may be a legal concept, but achieving it is an entirely political process. To the degree that foreign officials acknowledge Somaliland at all, they are generally sympathetic to its history and admiring of its recent accomplishments. Somaliland’s main obstacle is not the world’s animosity, but its indifference. Its current predicament answers the question: what would happen if you created a new country and no one noticed?Somaliland is pretty easy to get to. There are regular flights to the capital, Hargeisa, from Dubai and Addis Ababa. The city – a scruffy, sprawling town of cinderblock houses and potholed roads – feels coated in a fine film of desert dust. It’s usually extraordinarily dry, although periodic violent downpours in the rainy season leave the mostly unpaved streets damp and soggy. Camels are the traditional livelihood, food source and currency of Somali herders, and even in the big city, it’s not unusual to see them loping through busy downtown traffic. Food stalls crank out steaming, heaping plates of chewy camel meat (not bad) and thick, frothy camel milk (nauseating – to me, anyway).From other stalls, money-changers dispense grimy, faded bricks of shilling banknotes held together by rubber bands. When I was visiting, the shilling was trading at about 7,000 to the US dollar – although given that you can’t exchange Somaliland shillings anywhere outside Somaliland, I don’t exactly understand how this exchange rate is set. When paying for anything in a store with shillings, unless you know what you’re doing, it’s generally best to just hand over one of these bricks to the clerk and let him take out what he needs. Nowadays, most people are more likely to pay for basic goods and services by transferring cellphone credit.Try to book a hotel in Somaliland online from the US and you are likely to be referred to a travel advisory stating: “The US Department of State warns US citizens to avoid travel to Somalia because of continuous threats by the al-Qaida affiliated terrorist group, al-Shabaab.” But once you’re there, you quickly realise that such warnings are unnecessary. Hargeisa is one of the safest large cities in Africa, and, aside from the pollution and the traffic, there’s not too much to be concerned about when you’re walking around, although foreigners travelling outside the capital have been required to hire an armed guard since the killing of four foreign aid workers by bandits in 2004. There’s been almost no terrorist activity in Somaliland since 2008, when suicide bombers attacked the presidential palace and Ethiopian consulate. In contrast to the south, there is no pirate activity along Somaliland’s shores.Hargeisa’s main work of public art is a war memorial consisting of a stubby Mig fighter plane – a real one – shot down in 1988 and now mounted on a pedestal along the city’s main thoroughfare. Hargeisans will tell you, with some ironic pride, that their city is one of the few places in the world that was bombed by planes that took off from that same city. The event is part of a long chain of events, most of them tragic, leading up to the country’s strange current predicament.As the names of their countries suggest, there’s little ethnic or linguistic difference between the people of Somalia and Somaliland. The entity that today calls itself the Republic of Somaliland owes its existence to two main factors: its proximity to Yemen and its abundance of sheep. In the late 19th century, Britain (with the support of Italy) and France (with the support of Russia) were locked in a struggle for control of the Nile. As a means of both countering French influence and ensuring a regular supply of mutton for its garrison at the Yemeni port city of Aden, Britain signed a series of agreements with tribes in northern Somalia.In the words of the historian Ioan Lewis, “in relation to its size and significance” Somaliland was “one of Britain’s least rewarding possessions”. Yet there’s a good case to be made that its marginal status as a colony benefited the country in the long run. Whereas Somaliland had been considered a backwater by the British, and therefore left mostly to govern itself through the existing clan structure, Italy considered Somalia an integral part of its short-lived ambitions to build a north African empire that also included modern-day Libya and parts of Egypt.It shouldn’t be surprising that today the territory where the colonising power had more ambitious state-building goals is the more unstable. There is evidence from studies of regions of India and other parts of Africa to support the notion that postcolonial countries where colonisers had a lighter touch turned out better in the long term.As Somalilanders will often remind you, it was, in the past, an independent country, fully recognised by the international community, including the UN. But this halcyon period lasted less than a week. On 26 June 1960, the former Protectorate of Somaliland became fully independent from British rule, its independence recognised by 35 countries around the world, including the US. The next day, its new legislature passed a law approving a union with the south. On 1 July, Somalia became independent from Italy, and the two were joined together. It is a decision Somaliland has regretted almost ever since.Difficulties emerged almost immediately, and just a year after independence, voters in the north rejected a new constitution. The marriage was off to a rocky start. Things would go from bad to worse in 1969 when an officers’ coup brought a general named Siad Barre to power.The tensions within Somaliland society escalated as Barre’s long reign continued. Since independence, Somalia and Somaliland’s leaders have tended to favour members of their own clans and subclans with patronage. There are six main Somali clans, with dozens of subclans. The vast majority of those living in what is now Somaliland come from various branches of the Isaaq clan. The south is more heterogeneous. Barre may have espoused a doctrine of “scientific socialism”, a fusion of terrible governance ideas imported from China, North Korea and Nasserite Egypt, but he was not above ethnic nationalism, privileging his own Darod clan, which added to the resentment of the northern Isaaqs.During the 1980s, with support for Barre and his harsh military regime eroding, a primarily Isaaq northern rebel group known (somewhat misleadingly), as the Somali National Movement (SNM) emerged to challenge rule from Mogadishu. The crackdowns that followed simply added to the perception that the north was a region under occupation. This culminated in an all-out civil war between the SNM and the central government in the late 80s, during which thousands were killed and millions fled.On 18 May 1991, the SNM proclaimed that the region was re-establishing its independence, severing its ties to the south, and would now be known as the Republic of Somaliland. The world, for the most part, shrugged. The slow and steady process of state formation in the north would be almost entirely overshadowed in the international media by the chaos engulfing the south, particularly after an international intervention two years later led to the infamous “Black Hawk down” incident and the killing of 19 American troops during the battle of Mogadishu.So why has Somaliland been more successful and stable than its southern neighbour, even with virtually no assistance from the international community? The fact that is is largely populated by only one clan has helped it avoid tribal conflicts, unlike some other countries in the region. Most Somalilanders also point to the role of clan elders. In addition to a president and a traditional elected parliament, Somaliland has an unelected upper house of elders, somewhat similar to Britain’s House of Lords, which has a consultative role on certain legislation and is entrusted with settling disputes between the country’s subclans. “It’s the elders who really made this peace,” Mohamed Omar Hagi, a UK-based Somali activist, told me.Somaliland has also been lucky to benefit from the leadership of a few iniduals, most notably the country’s most prominent global advocate, Edna Adan. The most famous person in the country, she is generally just referred to in Somaliland as Edna. “We don’t have a George Clooney,” one local journalist told me, referring to the Hollywood star’s advocacy on behalf of South Sudan’s independence. “All we’ve got is Edna.”When I met Adan at the maternity hospital and midwifery school she runs in Hargeisa, which everyone just calls “Edna hospital”, she handed me her business card, which on the back features the caption “Where is Somaliland?” with an arrow pointing to the country’s location on a map of the Horn of Africa. Job one for Adan, who has travelled throughout the world, is simply telling people what and where her country is. “I can’t get anyone to come here,” she sighs. “The teachers and doctors cannot come to us because their governments tell them not to. I don’t know how you slipped through the net.”Adan’s office was decorated with photos of dignitaries she has met, from Hillary Clinton to Kofi Annan. The centrepiece was a striking photo of a very young Edna with her late husband, Mohamed Ibrahim Egal, at the White House with Lyndon B Johnson in 1968, when Egal was prime minister of Somalia.Adan was Somalia’s first qualified nurse-midwife, and the first Somali woman to drive. She spent years as a UN and WHO official before returning to Somaliland to build the hospital with her own savings for all its limitations on personnel and equipment, it is one of the premier facilities in the Horn of Africa. She’s been called the Muslim Mother Teresa for her work in promoting women’s health and campaigning against female genital mutilation. She also served for several years as Somaliland’s foreign minister, continuing to deliver babies while on the job.Although her political activities receive less attention than her public health work, Adan is also a tireless advocate for Somaliland’s independence. “For 25 years I’ve been waiting for the world to see how stable, peaceful and governable we are,” she told me, decrying what she called the “world conspiracy against Somaliland’s recognition”. Adan sees Somaliland’s unrecognised status as the main reason for its lack of economic progress over the past quarter-century.Non-recognition by western powers is having an impact on the status of women as well, Adan argued, saying that western countries’ lack of engagement was opening the door to the influence of fundamentalists from the Gulf. She pointed to an old photo of herself as first lady in a chic cocktail dress: “You see my pictures! We never used to cover ourselves from head to toe,” she said. “We had necks, we had hair, we were people. Others are getting into Somaliland faster than the west. And if that keeps on like this, heaven help us.”A large number of people are also dependent on $500m per year in remittances from the roughly million-strong Somaliland diaspora living for the most part in Britain, the US, Scandinavia and elsewhere in Africa. This isn’t unusual for developing countries, but officials are understandably worried that this flow of cash from abroad is a finite resource. Most members of the diaspora are refugees who left the country during the violence of the 1980s. Their children are less likely to feel the need to support aunts and uncles they barely know. “These offspring are now basically Americans or British or French or whatever,” energy minister Hussein Abdi Dualeh told me. “They don’t have the same attachment to the country.”With remittances likely to dry up in the coming years, and livestock an unreliable resource, the government is looking for other sources of investment, but Somaliland is a place with an image problem. “The name always scares people,” said Dualeh. “Anything that starts with ‘Somali’, no matter how it ends, is a red flag for a lot of people. But companies who are here realise it’s a very benign, very safe environment.”The twin hopes for the Somali economy are oil exploration – currently being carried out by a handful of hardier energy firms off the coast – and a plan by Dubai Ports World to develop the Red Sea port of Berbera, which could conceivably be an alternative means of bringing goods by sea into landlocked Ethiopia. But it’s hard to imagine that plan taking off without a serious improvement in roads and infrastructure, and that probably requires international investment.And for that in turn, once again, it would be helpful for other countries to know that Somaliland exists, and isn’t the same country as Somalia.One highly unusual feature of Somaliland’s situation is that it’s not actually looking to challenge the much-maligned borders drawn by Europeans across the African continent – it’s looking to restore them. “The international community said we seceded from Somalia. We did not. We already had our own nation,” said Mohammed Ahmed Mohamoud, AKA Barwani, a civil society activist and director of the Somaliland Non-State Actors Forum. “Our borders were established through an agreement between the Italian government and the British,” said foreign minister Saad Ali Shire. “It’s an internationally determined boundary.”Although it’s true that Somaliland voluntarily erased the border with Somalia in 1960, Somalilanders don’t consider that decision irreversible. As Somalilanders often point out, theirs wouldn’t be the first country to back out of a postcolonial merger. Senegal and the Gambia, a narrow strip of a country located completely within Senegal’s territory, were joined together as the confederation of Senegambia from 1982 to 1989. Egypt and Syria were briefly joined together as the United Arab Republic from 1958 until 1961, when Syria seceded. If these countries couldn’t make their marriages work, why, Somalilanders ask, should Somaliland be stuck in a loveless alliance?These arguments were hard to argue with in Hargeisa. But in the outside world, they’re unlikely to prove persuasive. For Somaliland, the frustrating reality is that the world map is preserved in place less by international law or even custom than by what’s sometimes called “path dependence” – the thousands of small decisions that, over time, lead to the creation of institutions, and that are very hard to unmake without massive disruption. Countries tend to stay the way they are, and people, with some justification, believe it would be awfully difficult and dangerous to change them.The last major wave of country creation took place in the early 1990sm as the end of the cold war hastened the breakup of the Soviet Union and the explosion of Yugoslavia. Since then, only a handful of new countries have joined the club – and many of them have struggled.The argument against Somaliland’s independence rests largely on factors beyond the country’s control. Somaliland officials are used to hearing that if their independence were recognised, it would set off a domino effect for nationalist movements, destabilising the continent. If Somaliland were independent, what would stop other regions from trying the same thing?International organisations such as the African Union and the Arab League are hostile to the idea of recognising further territorial isions. Countries wary of their own separatist movements don’t want to establish any sort of precedent. The UN, which has invested enormous resources in promoting stability and unity in Somalia as a whole, views Somaliland as a hindrance to those goals rather than any sort of beacon of stability. Somaliland’s neighbour Ethiopia mostly supports it, but given Addis Ababa’s wariness about its own Somali separatists, it likely prefers the status quo – a weak and ided Somalia – rather than a strong independent Somali state on its borders. The two most recent instances of country creation in Africa – autocratic, impoverished Eritrea and anarchic, violent South Sudan – have not bolstered Somaliland’s argument that its recognition would be a boon to regional and global stability.Western observers, both governmental and non-governmental, have generally been more positive. Noting that Somaliland, unlike most of its neighbours, has had several contested elections and peaceful transfers of power since independence, the US NGO Freedom House classified it as an “emerging democracy”, and it is the only country in its region considered at least “partly free” or higher on the group’s annual rankings.But even if non-African governments are, on the whole, generally sympathetic to Somaliland, it’s not enough of a priority to upset the status quo. Somalilanders like to joke mischievously that they have been too well behaved. After all, the other countries that have gained recognition in recent years have done so after wars and genocides.“Being a peaceful, democratic and developing state isn’t helping Somaliland gain international recognition,” said Hagi. “Somaliland is very quiet. It’s a peaceful place. The international community doesn’t really care about a peaceful place. When there is a problem in a country, the international community is always there – Somalia, Iraq, Syria, Libya. When there’s no problem there, there’s no point in coming to build a state.”Or, as Adan puts it: “At 78, I don’t want to face the possibility that everything I’ve been taught about democracy and human rights is wrong. Maybe I should just go join the Taliban.”They are joking, of course, but without some major turning point or dramatic shift in global priorities, it’s hard to see Somaliland winning recognition. The world will continue to defend an abstract principle of territorial integrity in the face of the clear will of the people of Somaliland.Recently, there have also been some troubling indications that Somaliland’s much-vaunted peace and stability might be more fragile than it seems. Dozens have been killed in fighting between Somaliland and Puntland – a neighbouring semi-autonomous region of Somalia – as part of a long-running clash over a disputed border region. Monitors have warned that the conflict risks breaking out into open war. The Somaliland government has also been condemned for detaining and harrassing journalists covering the conflict.For all its serious problems, though, it is hard to argue with Somaliland’s relative success. Perhaps this is the bigotry of low expectations, but whatever negatives you can say about the place, it’s not Somalia. With little help from the outside, Somaliland has had to do an awful lot on its own, and arguably done it better than many of its recognised counterparts.“In many African countries that have been recognised, they are still struggling,” said Barwani. “So, sometimes we say that maybe being a de facto state is better. Because many recognised states in Africa failed, and they became a one-party system of a dictatorship with no free media and no space for citizen participation. For us, we have so many things. No limitations, no restrictions.”Looking at the decades of support given by the US to dictators such as Mobutu Sese Seko, or considering the destabilising role of western oil companies in countries such as Nigeria, there’s a case to be made that if that’s what engagement with the outside world means for fragile African states, maybe Somaliland has been better off without it. If, at some point in the future, the world does decide to recognise its independence, bringing with it the attendant investment and diplomatic engagement, Somaliland will be in a stronger and more stable position to handle it. Shire remains optimistic that this day will come. “We’ve waited 25 years already.

An “ultimate elite, who are playing politics with real lives” had become dominant, she said.Soubry’s intervention followed a dramatic week at Westminster in which Conservative factions have openly battled for control while May tried desperately to keep her job and negotiate Brexit.On Monday, the Broxtowe MP gave a barnstorming speech during the debate on the customs bill, voicing anger at May’s decision to do a deal with Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group to head off a damaging rebellion. Until then Soubry had supported the prime minister’s new softer Brexit strategy that was signed off at Chequers a fortnight ago.Reflecting on those events, Soubry said: “Since the referendum, the forces of darkness have taken over and they have continued to take over and this week if there was every any doubt who was running this government it was quashed.”The MP said she had been told by the Tory chief whip, Julian Smith, on Monday afternoon that “80 Conservatives, including a large number of members of the government” had told him they would not support the customs bill unless May accepted the ERG amendments.That would have been enough to topple a flagship piece of Brexit legislation, and forced No 10 to agree to the amendments, one of which was designed to frustrate her proposals for a customs arrangement in which HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs could collect some duties on behalf of the European Union.The MP said she believed the ERG were “ruthless bastards” who would stop at nothing because they believed their cause was “bigger than anything else”. She added: “Now that the forces of darkness have got the prize in sight, they are going for it. I’m afraid that Theresa has embraced these people, they are now running Theresa.”ERG members and supporters include a range of Tory backbenchers, from veteran anti-Europe campaigners, such as John Redwood and Bill Cash, through to former ministers David Jones and Steve Baker, and young MPs including Andrea Jenkyns, who want to force out May. Rees-Mogg is its chair.Soubry accused May and party whips of operating a double standard, saying: “Jacob Rees-Mogg gets his tummy tickled when the ERG threatens to vote against a government bill unless it is amended on policy.”In contrast, when her ally Dominic Grieve “suggested parliament should have a vote in the event of no deal, which is process”, he and his potential Tory supporters were treated differently. “You are threatened, you are called a traitor, you are threatened with deselection, threats the like of which have never been seen before,” she said.Soubry warned the prime minister that she and her smaller group of about a dozen “mutineers” had not given up and could not be relied upon to vote for whatever the prime minister brought back from her Brexit negotiations.The 61-year-old MP said her view of the tight parliamentary arithmetic was that May would have to rely on about a dozen or so Labour MPs to vote with her because she believed that a hardcore of Tory ERG members would not vote for whatever was proposed.About five Labour MPs, including Kate Hoey and Frank Field, have consistently voted with the government on Brexit, but Soubry said more Labour MPs would be needed for May to see off any Tory rebellions: “She needs the likes of Caroline Flint to get it through.”Soubry conceded that the Tory remainer faction lacked the strength and discipline of the ERG up until now, adding that she and like-minded colleagues “needed to grow a pair” because they had failed to pull out or pulled back from the brink when confronting the government on Brexit.Soubry said the remainers needed to muster 16 rebels if they were to defeat the government, assuming all the opposition parties voted alongside them. “We did have at least 16 when the EU withdrawal bill came back, and the big mistake was that we did not do what we said we would do, which was have a vote on the Kerr amendment, which was very tame. That is recognised as being a mistake.”If passed by MPs last month, that amendment, proposed by the former diplomat now crossbench peer John Kerr, would have forced ministers to explain what they had done to pursue remaining in a customs union.Despite her frustrations, Soubry said it would be “deeply irresponsible” for anybody to challenge May and accused the prime minister’s rival Boris Johnson of “naked, blind ambition”.She said the former foreign secretary and his supporters were engaged in “willy-waving”, making light of the consequences of Brexit. “This is deeply grownup, serious stuff. Egos and this sort of willy-waving ambition is deeply unacceptable.”The MP, who was narrowly re-elected with a majority of 863 last year, said she had no intention of leaving the Conservative party, although she cooperates closely in parliament with pro-European Labour backbenchers Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie on Brexit. “I shall be true to what I believe. It is my intention to stand again in Broxtowe as a Conservative candidate. I just want my party back, please.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8def59cf1cef6f62580d173e6dd5bf30cd552af9/0_230_4172_2503/master/4172.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91c45c155186b6c6c41c12cf592895ee","title":"france minister nathalie loiseau brexit concessions theresa may commons","story":"EU’s Brexit negotiator raises concerns over smuggling, red tape and competitionThe EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has forensically picked apart Theresa May’s white paper after a meeting of the EU27, warning that the prime minister had failed to offer Brussels a firm basis for the negotiations.In a reflection of the widespread concern about the stability of May’s premiership, Barnier said he would be polite, but went on to illustrate in stark terms how the UK’s demands fell foul of the EU’s red lines and founding principles.“I am not negotiating, of course, on the basis of the white paper,” Barnier concluded, after a three-hour meeting of EU ministers in Brussels.The bloc’s negotiator also responded to May’s strident rejection of the EU’s solution for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, in which Northern Ireland would in effect stay in the customs union and single market until a trade deal or bespoke technological solution was arranged that could serve that function.The prime minister had committed to solving the problem, Barnier said, and having checks on goods passing from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK was not the same as creating a border in the Irish Sea.“We cannot afford to lose time on this issue,” Barnier said, “and this is why we have invited the UK to work on the backstop next week … We are working on the basis of what was agreed in March with Theresa May.”A senior diplomat said member states had been surprised and disappointed by the aggressive tone of May’s speech in Belfast earlier in the day, in which she accused the EU of seeking to perform an “economic and constitutional dislocation” of her country.It was, however, in giving the EU’s most detailed response yet to May’s hard-fought-over Brexit white paper that Barnier was at his most damning, evoking concerns over smuggling, red tape and putting European companies at a competitive disadvantageHe suggested that the UK’s position appeared far from settled. “This white paper is the result of a very intense debate in the United Kingdom that was necessary. Everyone can see that this debate is not over,” he said.The British government has said it wants to keep the UK in the EU single market for goods based on a common rulebook. In order to avoid customs checks, the government wants an unprecedented customs system where the UK would collect EU duties, while having the freedom to set different tariffs on goods destined for the British market.Barnier said this “facilitated customs arrangement” raised practical, legal, economic and budgetary questions.Setting out the questions he had posed to the new Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, during their first meeting on Thursday, Barnier said he was concerned that European businesses would face higher administrative costs and there would be increased opportunity for fraud.Barnier also questioned whether a non-EU country could collect EU customs without being subject to EU oversight. For this reason, EU diplomats say privately that the British plan can never be accepted. The EU is also deeply concerned that the customs plan would give outsider companies a competitive edge over European rivals if Britain and other countries used the UK as a route to avoid higher EU tariffs. “Are the British proposals in the interests of the EU?” Barnier asked.With reference to an EU position paper, which ruled out “cherrypicking” of elements of the bloc’s membership, Barnier made it clear he believed the UK had breached the EU’s red lines. Barnier’s deconstruction of the white paper came after the French government said May’s capitulation to Brexiters in parliament since its publication had made the task of negotiating a deal “even harder”.On Monday, in order to avoid an embarrassing defeat in the Commons, the government reluctantly accepted four amendments put forward by Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Research Group of Conservative MPs, who was seeking to wreck May’s proposed custom plans.Arriving in Brussels to meet Barnier, France’s European affairs minister, Nathalie Loiseau , said the acceptance by May of amendments backed by hardline Tory Brexiters had further complicated the already troubled talks.She said: “We know there have been amendments to different provisions in Britain, which makes it even harder for us to discuss with our British partners.”Michael Roth, Germany’s Europe minister, said: “I will remain an optimist, but it is hard to remain an optimist in these challenging times.”With doubt growing about the credibility of the white paper, Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, admitted the plan agreed at Chequers was merely a starting point for future talks.Questioned by reporters on a visit to Scotland, Hunt twice refused to describe the Chequers plan as the UK’s “final offer” on Brexit. “It’s our substantive offer I think is the best way to phrase it,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31fc67bb1f8d066718d116d914d3f7e90800b01f/318_281_2309_1386/master/2309.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1496444103585da3da1b6e2550294bb0","title":"revealed tory donors who paid 7m to socialise with theresa may","story":"Jacob Rees-Mogg’s business partner, Brexit backers and wife of Putin minister among benefactorsJacob Rees-Mogg’s business partner, a string of Brexit backers and the wife of a former senior minister to Vladimir Putin are among the Conservative donors who have paid more than £7m to socialise with Theresa May since the general election.Eighty-one party benefactors have paid a total of £7.4m to the Conservative party for access to the prime minister at dinners, lunches after PMQs and drinks receptions since July 2017, records show.Party insiders said the large amount raised over just nine months from a single revenue stream was evidence that the Tories were aiming to be “election ready” for the autumn.At least 10 of the donors, who joined the Leader’s Group for £50,000 a head, are supporters of a hard Brexit.Dominic Johnson, who attended two of the group’s events in 2017, is the co-founder of Somerset Capital Management, an investment firm set up with Rees-Mogg, who chairs the European Research Group of Tory Brexiter MPs.Somerset was recently reported to be warning its clients about “considerable uncertainty” as a result of Brexit, and set up a fund in Ireland, which benefits from EU financial passporting rights.Sir Michael Hintze, the hedge fund billionaire who gave £100,000 to Vote Leave, is a familiar figure in Conservative circles and attended at least one dinner in 2017 with the prime minister, sources said.Hardy McLain, a retired US hedge fund manager living in London, attended events in 2017 and 2018. He previously donated £20,000 to the Vote Leave campaign.It is the first time since July 2017 that any details of Leader’s Group dinner guests have emerged. Their identities have been quietly released by the Conservatives this week.Receiving campaign donations is a routine activity for politicians. But each gift carries with it a potential conflict of interest if the prime minister’s policies appear to benefit those who made the donations.Edmund Truell, who attended dinners in 2017 and 2018, owns a Swiss-listed private equity business called Disruptive Capital, whose mission statement is to “exploit market uncertainty” to generate returns.Only two women are among the Leader’s Group donors disclosed in the documents.Lubov Chernukhin, whose husband, Vladimir, is a former Russian deputy finance minister, was given access to the prime minister between last July and September. She has given £626,500 to the Tories since 2012, including £160,000 to play tennis with Boris Johnson and £30,000 to dine with the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson.Alisa Swidler, a US philanthropist and friend of Bill Clinton who has given £336,686 to the party, also attended an event with May.The Conservatives’ chief executive, the mining tycoon Sir Mick Davis, told a meeting of donors in September that the party needed to raise an additional £6m through the parliamentary cycle if it was to win the next general election.Records show that Lord Ashcroft, a former Conservative party treasurer who gave millions to the party under William Hague’s leadership but stopped donating during David Cameron’s premiership, appears to be back in the fold and is a member of May’s Leader’s Group. He was joined by the former government adviser and investor in payday loans, Adrian Beecroft.May appears to bring cabinet members to each event. She was joined by Amber Rudd, then home secretary, and Brandon Lewis, the party chairman, at events between the election and the end of September Philip Hammond, the chancellor, and Boris Johnson, then foreign secretary, accompanied her to Leader’s Group meetings in the autumn between January and April this year, May was joined by Johnson, Michael Gove, Liam Fox and four other cabinet ministers.The Conservatives had not updated details of donors who attended events since July 2017. Cameron pledged to release information about donors after an outcry over the Leader’s Group dinners and whether they were allowing the rich and powerful to buy access to the cabinet.The documents were spotted this week by campaigners for a second referendum on membership of the EU. Chris Bryant, the MP for Rhondda and supporter of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “People will rightly be angry to see the government listen to Brexit donors in return for donations to the Tory party while denying the British public a vote on their deal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a1ea025be44b6f985bd410ff3cfb1701a288a40/0_172_3412_2047/master/3412.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddcb96dae5dc292c6b57ea16a9ecae5f","title":"greg rutherford emtional return london stadium long jump","story":"• Long jumper hindered by ankle pain before Anniversary Games• ‘I haven’t trained since Monday,’ 2012 Olympic champion saysGreg Rutherford has said he is emotionally preparing for one final return to the London Stadium – the scene of his long-jump Olympic gold in 2012 – but admitted that constant pain in his left foot has left his training schedule in tatters.Rutherford was part of the British trio including Mo Farah and Jessica Ennis-Hill who won Olympic gold on Super Saturday six years ago, but after a rough couple of years he exclusively revealed to the  last month that he will retire later this summer. His performances at the Anniversary Games this weekend will dictate whether he makes the Great Britain squad for a final swansong at the European Championships next month but, no matter the result, Rutherford is hoping to soak up the atmosphere in London one final time.“It’s going to be a very emotional weekend for me,” he said. “The six years since London 2012 have absolutely shot past, and I’ve always had the most amazing reception here. It definitely brings a tear to the eye. I’ll probably be crying more than jumping, to be honest.”Rutherford’s list of injuries also makes eye-watering reading. Four operations on his right ankle, a painful groin reconstruction, hamstring problems and having his stomach wall knitted up have blighted his career in recent years. But it is the pain in his left foot and ankle because of ligament damage that is forcing his early retirement.“I’m in a very different place to where I was a couple of years ago coming into Diamond League events. I know my body is in a bit of a rough place, which is frustrating. Just going out and jumping half-decent would be nice. It’s a bit of a make-or-break weekend because if I jump just over eight metres I probably go to the Europeans. If not, I’ll leave it there and get ready for the last couple of meets that I have.”After long jumping, a career in broadcasting is appealing, but Rutherford also revealed he has had encouraging results preparing for a lab test with British Cycling to see if he can make the transition to bike racing.“As much as I struggle to run in a straight line and jump into a sandpit, I can still produce a lot of power. I was producing a similar level to what an elite international was doing but in trainers, that’s without cleats. Apparently that is quite good.”The long jump field this weekend will feature the reigning world champion Luvo Manyonga, although the world indoor champion Juan Miguel Echevarría – who jumped a wind-assisted 8.83m in Stockholm last month, the biggest long jump in 23 years – has withdrawn injured. This weekend victory may be beyond Rutherford, but should he be selected on Monday for the Europeans next month he could still end his career on a high. “I will only go to Berlin if I feel I still have the chance of winning a medal,” he said. “European long jumping is pretty rubbish at the moment, that’s not me being horrible, it’s pretty awful, hence why there’s still a chance. But I have to do well on Sunday.”Another London 2012 gold-medal winner returning to Stratford this weekend is Jamaica’s Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce following the birth of her son, Zyon. The 31-year-old is yet to compete in a Diamond League event this year but is one of the favourites on Saturday , with the British sprinter Dina Asher-Smith in awe of her rival.The London-born 22-year-old is herself adjusting to a new life, having graduated from King’s College with a 2:1 in history last year, recovering from an ankle injury and moving out of her parents’ house in January.“I’ve been just trying to grow up and be an adult, get my head around council tax and bills – food shopping is really expensive,” Asher-Smith said. “I’ve got confidence that I am in good shape. After last year I’ve learned to just have confidence in my ability. Have faith and patience in the process.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a5d5f1a34164605d03e25b468b6da18ad12c54c/0_27_2324_1394/master/2324.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97d9debc0511af27d23592dd10528a2c","title":"peter sagan sprints third tour de france victory stage 13","story":"Christian Prudhomme’s appeal for calm before Friday’s 13th stage fell on deaf ears when a lit flare was lobbed into the peloton a few hours later.The flare was thrown from the side of the road towards the end of the stage – which was won by Peter Sagan in a sprint finish – and added weight to the warning sounded by the Tour de France director.Prudhomme had spoken out after tensions increased during Thursday’s chaotic climb of Alpe d’Huez in which Chris Froome was jostled and spat at, and his rival and former Tour de France champion Vincenzo Nibali was forced out of the race after crashing because of a spectator.“We need to restore calm and respect all the riders,” Prudhomme said. “It was a very annoying climb of Alpe d’Huez. The riders on the Tour, and champions of the Tour, must be respected, as they are by the large majority of the public.“It was very calm for 10 days, with only a few anti-Froome or anti-Sky placards, but at a stroke, it all went up again.”The cumulative effect of serial doping scandals, from the Festina Affair to Lance Armstrong, is that there is less respect for the Tour peloton now than 20 years ago. Meanwhile, the knives that have been out for Froome and Team Sky since the Grand Départ in the Vendée are now being sharpened.The 13th stage , from Bourg d’Oisans to Valence, raced by a peloton shorn of many big-name sprinters, was won with a degree of inevitability by Sagan but the day’s events were overshadowed by the aftermath of the chaos on Alpe d’Huez.Nibali was forced to leave the Tour following his crash. The 2014 champion, chasing Froome through a pall of smoke caused by roadside flares, was brought down by a strap hanging over the barriers from a spectator’s camera.After a 120km round trip from Alpe d’Huez to a Grenoble hospital where his fractured vertebrae were confirmed, Nibali was visited late on Thursday night at his hotel by an apologetic Prudhomme. The Italian is likely to return to racing at the Vuelta a España, while his team, although angered by his crash, are not expected to take any further action.“It’s a paradox that Vincenzo Nibali, who has nothing to do with Team Sky, ended up on the tarmac,” Prudhomme said.Asked about that incident and about his own treatment by spectators, Froome was critical. “During the race, it’s the responsibility of the organisers to protect the riders,” Froome said.Although Team Sky’s principal, Dave Brailsford, said “you expect professional athletes to play and entertain without being impacted on by the crowd”, the team’s head of technical operations, Carsten Jeppesen, told the  that rider security on Alpe d’Huez had actually been improved.“They have done a lot more than usual,” Jeppesen said of the race organisers, ASO. “I think they’ve done a really good job actually. ASO takes it seriously and they are trying to bring in more cops and make sure that certain key points are taken care of.“Luckily Chris was not knocked off by the guy that pushed him, but it’s Alpe d’Huez. It’s not the first time something like that happened there. It is one of the iconic places in the sport and there was also a lot of British fans out there and a lot of support.”Despite that, Froome and Thomas were booed yet again at Friday’s start although it is clear the reigning champion is seen as the villain of the piece.The French media, now expecting a sixth Team Sky win in seven years, have also picked up the baton. Team Sky was described as the “snake with two heads” by Liberation, while L’Equipe said that “when you wear the jersey of the British team, suspicion is as contagious as herpes”.The physicality of Thomas’s strength to sprint clear of his peers at the top of the exhausting climb to Alpe d’Huez, brought comparisons with Eddy Merckx from one veteran in the press room. But it also brought eye-rolling and derision from others, baffled by Sky’s continuing production line of Grand Tour contenders.“If my grandma rode for Sky she could win the Tour,” a fan named as Jules told L’Equipe after he had booed and jeered Thomas’s success on the Alpe.Meanwhile, some believe that Thomas is merely Froome’s stooge, a glorified lead-out man, there to take the sting out of the world time trial champion, Tom Dumoulin, before the final and potentially decisive time trial next Saturday to Espelette.But what if Thomas is the one bluffing? What if Sky harbour doubts about Froome’s capacity, after his win in the Giro d’Italia, to rise to the challenge of winning his fourth Grand Tour in a row, a feat which, incredibly, would equate to being unbeaten for three whole months of racing?What if, rather than being simply a decoy for the under-fire Froome, jeered and jostled from the Vendée to Valence, it was always all about Thomas, and enabling him to profit from Dumoulin’s focus on marking Froome? In Team Sky’s long history of befuddling cycling’s establishment with doublethink and contradiction, that might yet be the greatest coup of them all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c558a1d18cdef13577f0920ad1270c2ec7a7b950/0_42_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ec2a7b53393931c0e6c686a48ca637e","title":"pragmatic rory mcilroy plays conditions stay contention","story":"Rory McIlroy virtually had the putting green to himself as he finished off the preparations for his second round, striding purposefully after a couple of long ones and then a medium-length attempt before he joined his caddie and they headed off for the 1st tee. He looked as if he meant business.It was just after 7.45am, light rain had started a couple of hours earlier and there was room to spare in the stands surrounding the tee-box as he hammered his drive down the right-hand side of the fairway, a good 100 yards beyond those of his playing partners, Marc Leishman and Thorbjorn Olesen, who both opted for irons.He was to miss the birdie putt, as did the other two, and despite several of his tee shots missing the fairways thereafter, one of them at the par-five 6th which ended in the rough on the adjacent 5th before he recovered well but missed a second successive makeable birdie putt, he was to all intents and purposes treading water. Olesen and Leishman had both picked up shots by that stage.That was to change at the 7th and, with the rain getting heavier, he picked up his first shot and three more followed on the back nine, with two bogeys, and he signed for a two-under 69, the same total as on the first day but with his name significantly advanced on the leaderboard. The world No\u0026nbsp8 then pronounced himself satisfied with his morning, even though the changing conditions had forced him to abandon the attack-at-all-costs approach he planned to use.“It was just damp enough and cold enough that the game plan that I was trying to adapt to be aggressive and hit driver a lot, I just couldn’t do it,” McIlroy said.The pace of play, with the three-ball often having to wait to play their second shots from as early as the 2nd fairway – a situation made more difficult by having an amateur shooting eight over in the game ahead and, further in front, Tommy Fleetwood waiting for a ruling by the 6th green – could not have helped, but the trio managed to keep sufficiently dry and fully occupied. The Dane got round in a second successive 70 for a two-under total and Leishman managed a second 72 for two over. The round took them a little over four hours and 40 minutes.McIlroy had spent the earlier part of the week speaking of a desire to display more of the carefree spirit he showed in his younger playing days and admitted that his failure to put up a meaningful battle when in the final pair with Patrick Reed for the fourth round of the Masters and then to some extent his first 18 holes at the US Open, where he shot an 80, had left a mark on him.“Sunday at Augusta was a big learning curve for me because, even if I hadn’t won that tournament but I went down swinging and aggressive and committing to every shot, I would have walked away a lot happier,” he said.“When I did hit driver today I hit it well, so that was a good thing. So if the conditions do change and go back to the way they were on the first day, I’d see myself hitting a lot more drivers. I’m in a great position going into the third day. I feel like I played in the toughest of the conditions and definitely our side of the draw, we had to tough it out a little bit and I’m happy to be in with a shot.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f23f491b97bfd55d4873936c1d7935f3ee0f5b7/734_699_4042_2425/master/4042.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b18fc66b523e3e758dc18f9976d6409e","title":"fun frivolity watching tour de france in pictures","story":"By the time the Tour de France finishes in Paris on 29 July, millions of fans will have lined the 2,000-mile route.

In 2017, Donegal even topped National Geographic’s list of the coolest places on the planet. Anna Hart rounds up the 10 best things to do on a Donegal road trip Ireland’s most rugged and ravishing county has been a much-loved retreat for artists, bohemians, outdoorsy types and holidaying families for decades, but it’s only now that the rest of the world is waking up to the charms of traversing Donegal by car. Dramatic, secluded beaches, craggy coastlines, soaring peaks, shimmering lakes, verdant valleys and time-warp harbours – all dotted with atmospheric country pubs and quaint seafood restaurants – recently propelled this north-west county to the top of National Geographic Traveller’s Cool List. “It’s a warm-hearted place, but wilderness always feels just a stone’s throw away,” says National Geographic Traveller editor Pat Riddell. “And it is wilderness – world-class wilderness.” It’s definitely the coolest place on the planet right now if you’re a Star Wars fan. The region’s Inishowen peninsula was spectacularly showcased in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, with Malin Head being used to represent bits of Luke Skywalker’s isolated retreat, planet Ahch-To. This only added to the buzz around this long-overlooked corner of Ireland, further embellishing its hip credentials and making it the stuff of road-trip dreams. If you’re taking your car to Ireland by ferry to explore the attractions of Donegal, make sure you hop out at the following must-do spots.Sink a pint at McGrory’sUnassuming but atmospheric, 1920s family-run McGrory’s hotel in Culdaff has long been a local favourite, thanks to its open fires, a dazzling range of Irish craft beers and traditional music sessions. So much so that Daisy Ridley and the Star Wars crew had a night out there around filming, leading to a steady stream of Star Wars-struck visitors. Making the most of the welcoming atmosphere and seafood-heavy menu is now even more of a must.Swap four wheels for two While Donegal rewards road-trippers with sublime coastal scenery, isolated castles, private estates and ancient forests, it’s also a great spot to jump on a bike and blast some of that Atlantic sea breeze into your lungs. The peninsula at Horn Head, forming part of Sheephaven Bay, is perhaps the most scenic of all the Donegal peninsulas, where the cliffs rise to 180 metres (600ft) on the ocean side and provide breeding grounds for seabirds such as the European shag and razorbill. The Hornhead loop can be walked or driven, but biking is the best way to drink it all in, speeding past quartzite cliffs, mud flats, dunes and the salty New Lake area, complete with exceptional views of the Atlantic Ocean.Scale Mount ErrigalThe stark, striking quartzite mass of 751-metre Mount Errigal looms as you head east on the N56 from Gweedore. This is the tallest peak in County Donegal, and along with Mweelrea, is considered one of the most satisfying climbs in the county. Alternatively, drive to the coast and take a bracing walk at the highest sea cliffs in Europe – Slieve League. They stretch 600 metres (2,000ft) above the Atlantic Ocean at the highest point, with impressive views of the rugged coastline and Donegal Bay. Lose yourself in Letterkenny With a population of nearly 20,000, Letterkenny is Donegal’s most populous town, a confident and vibrant former market town famous for gothic-style St Eunan’s Cathedral – and its Hindu temple too. Donegal County Museum, housed in a 19th-century workhouse building, is a great place to get clued up on the county’s former industrial history, and, just south-west of town, the Newmills Corn and Flax Mills have a huge working waterwheel powered by the River Swilly.Picnic at Glenevin waterfallGlenevin waterfall is found at the top of a short hike of just over a mile through the woods in Clonmany, with nicely landscaped picnic areas, footbridges and stepping stones adding to the magic of this beautiful spot. Stock up on sandwiches, quiches and sweet treats at Claire The Bakers in Carndonagh beforehand.Explore Malin Head on the Inishowen peninsulaMalin Head, Ireland’s most northerly point, offers spectacular views, and the northernmost tip, Banba’s Crown, is one of the most photographed spots in the county. Sip a flat white from the Caffe Banba coffee truck (which also has a standalone cafe in Carndonagh) and see if you can spot scenery that made an appearance in Star Wars: The Last Jedi.Take a trip to Tory IslandTory Island, just 8.5 miles off the mainland, is an island steeped in history and folklore, where Irish is spoken and the locals elect a king, who acts as the community spokesperson. Seventy-four-year-old musician Patsy Dan Rodgers has been king for two decades now, ruling over this island of 150 inhabitants, a single road, one church, one grocery store, one lighthouse, one hostel and a social club.Surf the AtlanticThe Wild Atlantic Way is studded by tiny surf towns and beaches that have become legendary among the European surf community. Bundoran is widely considered one of the best surfing spots in Europe, and is fantastic for all kinds of water sports and horseshoe-shaped Magheraroarty Strand and sand dune-backed Ballyhiernan Bay are both suitable for windsurfing and surfing. Beginners can get to grips with the sport at Inishowen, which has some of the most consistent waves in Ireland, due to its exposure to rolling swells. Its long stretches of golden sandy beaches make for safe surfing conditions and a pleasant environment for newbies.Cook your catchCatch and cook your own dinner on a fishing trip with An Duanai Mara Boat Charters, based in the fishing town of Killybegs. On these deep-sea angling trips (combined with sightseeing trips around Donegal Bay), you’ll have the chance to reel in a cod, ling or turbot, watch the skipper fillet it, and then feast on it at nearby Kitty Kelly’s restaurant.Hike Glenveagh national parkGlenveagh national park is one of six in Ireland, encompassing some 16,000 hectares in the heart of the Derryveagh mountains. These lands were managed as a private deer forest before becoming a national park in 1975, and this is now bona fide wilderness, home to a lot of indigenous wildlife and rare plant species.Explore Ireland from the comfort of your own car with Irish Ferries.

Opened in the 1920s, it still hosts professional bouts in front of audiences of 1,200 people.But in its near-century, the venue has never seen anything like the event that took place on Wednesday, when more than 1,000 teenagers queued to watch two of YouTube’s biggest stars – and rivals – trade insults ahead of their highly publicised boxing match next month. KSI, a Fifa gamer turned internet personality, and Logan Paul, who found fame posting skits on Vine and is best known for mocking the dead body of a suicide victim in one of his videos, are big names on YouTube, with almost 20 million subscribers each. They’ve been sparring verbally for months, and after KSI defeated fellow YouTube star Joe Weller in a boxing match in February, fans began piling on the pressure for KSI and Logan to have their turn in the ring. The whole thing is very silly, very theatrical and almost completely incomprehensible if you are older than 20. It is also huge. The fight will take place in the 21,000-capacity Manchester Arena in August, with tickets costing between £30 and £150, and it will be streamed on YouTube’s pay-per-view platform for £6, though the company has distanced itself from the event and is not commenting on the fight.KSI, from London, will be defending his self-proclaimed title of YouTube boxing champion (claimed earlier this year following a third-round knockout of Weller) against his American foe Paul, with various members of the pair’s “squads” – including their brothers, Deji Olatunji and Jake Paul – also agreeing to fight each other.Outside York Hall, an hour before the press conference is due to start, the queue is round the corner and down the street, with those at the back being assured they have no chance of getting in but continuing to queue. They are here for the chance to see their icons, and in this multicultural London crowd, that overwhelmingly means KSI and his squad, the Sidemen.In fact, when one of Logan’s team – the Logang – drives past the entrance in a flash car, a spontaneous chant of “fuck Jake Paul” begins almost immediately, not dying down until the car is well down the street and into the side entrance. Amy, 19, who came down from Newcastle for the event, and started queuing at 7.30am, described Jake as “arrogant and childish”.“I’m not sure if it’s just a character he’s playing or if he’s really like that but I just don’t like his personality,” she said. Her friend Yara agreed. “They’ve been really controversial despite not having been on YouTube for that long,” she said. Still, the younger Paul apparently revels in it, later egging the crowd on and joining in the chant when it restarts as he takes the stage. It is not hard to see why they rub people up the wrong way: the pair got their start with six-second pranks on Vine, before moving on to bigger and better things, both virtually, trading Vine for YouTube, and physically, moving from Westlake in Ohio to LA. Since then, they have been constantly in the press for their antics, from manufactured drama for their YouTube channels to real drama with their neighbours.Last July, Jake’s $17,000-a-month (£13,000) rented home played host to a stunt involving a burning pile of mattresses that was the final straw for many of those living near him.Logan has perhaps been less deliberately obnoxious, but the same thoughtless attitude has brought him as much trouble. In January, YouTube disowned him and demonetised his channel for a stunt in a suicide hotspot in Japan that saw him laughing and joking around a body.There is also a geographic element. KSI and Deji were playing to a hometown crowd, and they knew it. “Welcome to London, motherfucker,” Deji shouted as he came onstage to square off against Jake.Although billed as a press conference, the real audience were at home watching, which meant the whole affair was more of a pastiche of a boxing press conference, as filtered through news broadcasts, films and highlights of previous matches. That did not stop the crowd from getting into the spirit of the event. Standing in the front row, Joe, a high-school pupil, said: “KSI’s a thrasher, right, but Deji’s too small to be fighting Jake Paul. Props to Deji for going for it, though.His friend Jordie disagreed. “Everyone said that Joe Weller was going to beat the shit out of KSI, and look what happened, so Deji … tank. Tank gang,” he said, referring to a music video with the same name put out by Deji in December.The rivalry, though profitable, also seems sincere. When KSI arrived on stage he picked up Deji’s lead, hurling abuse – a mix of theatrical and apparently genuine insults – at Logan, but the older Paul brother is either too outgunned by the crowd, or too cowed, to fight back.He sits, mostly in silence, as the insults become personal – KSI turned at one point to the father of the Paul clan, himself a minor internet celebrity, and asked “how do you make not one, but two, dumb-ass children? What the fuck is wrong with your sperm?” – and the audience gets meaner. KSI brings up Logan’s new girlfriend, the actor Chloe Bennet, and the crowd spontaneously starts chanting “she’s a slut”. Eventually, Logan drops the mic and walks out, seemingly on the edge of tears, cutting the event short. The crowd clears out, and Logan flees in a bright yellow Rolls-Royce. But it is not quite the end: hoping to see more of KSI, half the audience ascends the stairwell of a neighbouring housing estate, while the rest cram up against the gates of the car park. The YouTubers cannot get out, the teens cannot get in, and there is gridlock – until someone starts chucking construction debris from the roof, the stars are shepherded back in, and the police are called.Despite that, Yara is happy with how it went. “In terms of the actual conference, I’m biased in saying this, but as a fan of JJ it was great. Most if not all of the audience were rooting in his favour, and both JJ and Deji did get to say what they wanted to say to Logan and Jake,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f695f73a667d28d9b64e73b2a5d4d1b80a549c4a/0_99_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7f71f19b9ff5c4d14488d1917caaa79","title":"north korea mike pompeo russia china oil sanctions","story":"The US has urged Russia and China to clamp down on repeated breaches of the oil sanctions regime imposed on North Korea, saying America had evidence of at least 89 illegal ship-to-ship oil transfers this year.Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, was speaking at the UN headquarters in New York on Friday, the day after Russia and China at the UN sanctions committee rejected a US call to step up sanctions saying it needed further evidence of North Korean sanctions evasion.The Russian and Chinese decision at the UN was the first fissure in the international alliance putting pressure on Pyongyang to act on its commitment to end its efforts to become a nuclear power and effectively delayed further discussions on extra sanctions for as long as six months.The US claims on the basis of intelligence that North Korea using ship-to-ship transfers in international waters has breached a cap of 500,000 barrels of refined oil a year – imposed by the security council in December. The US had demanded an immediate halt to all further oil transfers. “Strict enforcement of sanctions” was critical to achieving the goal of North Korea’s denuclearisation, Pompeo said.Despite the diplomatic reverse, Pompeo said after his briefing with the UN that he remained confident that it will be possible to reach an agreement on North Korean denuclearisation, saying it was even possible to envisage North Korea attending meetings at the UN “not as a pariah, but as a friend”.But his call for Russia and China to act on the evidence of North Korean sanctions evasion represents a change in tone from previous US optimistic assessments of the direction the Pyongyang regime was taking. His remarks underscored the US belief that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is acting under duress, and a united international sanctions regime is critical to ensuring final verified denuclearisation.Kim made a broad commitment to denuclearise at an unprecedented summit with Donald Trump in June, but offered no details as to how and when this might take place, leaving considerable doubts about Pyongyang’s intentions.Pompeo reiterated his view that it would take some time and the path ahead was difficult. He also called for sanctions to be tightened on coal imports.Pompeo visited Pyongyang in early July and the two sides struggled to make headway on the denuclearisation issue. At the end of the talks the North Korean foreign ministry accused the US of making unilateral demands and behaving like gangsters. The US senator Lindsey Graham, representing a current of thinking inside the Republican party, said he feared that China had intervened to sour the talks. “I see China’s hands all over this,” he said in the wake of the fruitless Pompeo talks. Pompeo’s visit came immediately after the US on 6 Julyslapped tariffs on $34bn of goods from China, a move that China promptly matched. On Friday, Trump threatened to impose tariffs on all $505bn in Chinese imports.Pompeo’s UN briefing was undertaken jointly with the South Korean foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, who has struck a more optimistic note this week. She said there was a shared analysis of the situation between China and the US and implied the North Korean leader had taken an irreversible decision. Speaking at Chatham House she said scepticism was necessary given the history of past failed talks but went on: “I think that what is clear is that there is the political will that was not there in any previous negotiations, from the top level, to move in that direction.”She added: “Having come out this far, for him to go back, I think will be hugely risky.”On the North’s demolition of its nuclear-testing site in Punggye-ri, she said, “We will press them, at some point, to verify that this is a genuine closure.”She warned “given the pace of developments there is an expectation that things are going to move very fast. We need to pace ourselves because this will take time.”She also said the US troop presence in South Korea was not part of the talks with the North."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0506865032aa7aec54e5905a9fb61ee832cfdf09/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=595febc2b3afabe75122a773a4b4bbae","title":"zika epidemic sheds light on brazils invisible children","story":"Exclusive: families of thousands of babies born with neurodevelopmental disorders may get help for first timeBrazil’s “invisible children”, the thousands of babies born with neurodevelopmental disorders, have been brought out of the shadows by the Zika virus epidemic and their families may get help for the first time.Almost 4,000 babies were born in Brazil with microcephaly as a result of Zika virus infection – a brain malformation that left them with small and misshapen heads and poor developmental prospects.But nobody knows how many babies have been born in Brazil with other developmental disorders. They are invisible all over the world, where it is estimated there are 250 million children with developmental delay or disability. The numbers are thought to be probably twice as high in the developing world as they are in the more prosperous countries of North America and Europe.“Zika affected probably a relatively small amount of children – a few thousand. The epidemic came and went and hasn’t come back,” said David Edwards, a professor of paediatrics and neonatal medicine at King’s College London. It was a tragedy for each of them and their families, he said, but the numbers “pale into insignificance compared with the large number of children who are affected by neurodevelopmental disorders.” The two most common causes of death and disability in newborn babies are birth asphyxia and prematurity. Well-equipped modern hospitals in the western world can prevent much of the death and damage from these causes. But women in poor countries may have far to go to reach a maternity unit and can have very long labours. A colleague of Edwards working in Uganda told him: “We think 12 hours is a long labour. They think 12 days is a long labour.”Many women in developing countries are malnourished, which increases the risk to mother and baby. Genetic factors causing such disorders as Down’s syndrome and fragile X play a part in all countries.Some of them, from the poorest families, have parents who work and older siblings are charged with looking after them. “We have children taking care of children,” she said. “It is too difficult for them.”She and Edwards were part of an expert group brought together to discuss childhood neurodevelopmental disorders in Brazil by the UK’s Academy of Medical Sciences and the Academia Brasileira de Ciências at a workshop in Rio de Janeiro. The group’s report calls for more to be done for the invisible children not only in Brazil but around the world.In Brazil, they identified a need for more diagnosis and assessment, as well as the collection of better data on how many children with neurodevelopmental disorders there are. Children’s doctors need to be trained to diagnose babies and healthcare workers need to be able to offer support to families. The Zika crisis in Brazil and the fear it might spread around the world through mosquitoes and even, potentially, sexual transmission brought resources and expertise into a neglected area and has now shone a light on other damaged babies, says the report. “The identification and inclusion of ‘invisible children’ into the public health system has been an important consequence of the crisis,” it says."},{"url":null,"title":"it s a huge find megalithic passage tomb discovered in co meath","story":"  July 16, 2018Archaeologists uncover burial chambers on historic Br\u0026uacute na B\u0026oacuteinne heritage site   July 19, 2018Department warned against changes to house built above 5,000-year-old tomb "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3571693.1532113611!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sharp backstop differences between varadkar and may","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May delivers a speech at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast, on Friday. The British prime minister challenged the EU to reply to last week’s British government White Paper. Photograph: Charles McQuillanReuters Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the British prime minister Theresa May differed sharply on the Border backstop on Friday, with Mr Varadkar saying it was the UK’s responsibility to come up with a solution, while Ms May insisted it was up to the EU to overcome the logjam in the negotiations that threaten a “no deal” Brexit next March.At the same time in Brussels, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the British Brexit White Paper was largely unworkable and raised fundamental questions for the European Union. The statements by the Irish and British leaders and the EU’s Brexit chief on Friday demonstrated the extent of the difficulties over the backstop.Speaking in Cork, Mr Varadkar said the onus was on the British government “to bring forward proposals that are workable. We are very happy to talk about the wording of the backstop but the outcome must be the same – the outcome must be that in all circumstances that there won’t be a hard border between North and South.”“We are open to discussions on a backstop that achieves what we want it to achieve. But it must be better or the same as we have proposed,” Mr Varadkar said.But speaking in Belfast, where she was accompanied by members of the DUP, Ms May said: “It is now for the EU to respond, not simply to fall back on to previous positions which have already been proven unworkable, but to evolve their position in kind.”She challenged the EU to reply to last week’s British government White Paper that proposes a free trade area in goods and agricultural products between the UK and the EU. She said it represented a “coherent package” and a “significant development” in the British position.In Brussels, Mr Barnier acknowledged several positive aspects in the British White Paper, but said that is not compatible in important respects with fundamental EU values, notably the integrity of the single market, is largely unworkable, and conflicts with EU economic interest.Both the EU and the UK agreed last December that there should be a “backstop” – a guarantee of no hard border in Ireland even if the two sides cannot agree on a future trade and customs deal. But there has been no agreement on how it would work in practice, or how it can be translated into a legally enforceable text.The EU has said that without a backstop, there can be no withdrawal agreement – threatening a “no-deal” Brexit where the UK crashes out of the EU next March.However, some Brussels sources say that with all sides indicating they are willing to consider a new wording for the backstop, a breakthrough would unlock the prospects for a deal on the withdrawal agreement.Meanwhile the Irish Aviation Authority has confirmed that flights from UK carriers will not be permitted to land in the Republic in the event of a hard Brexit unless a separate deal to cover aviation is struck with the UK government.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Wednesday that the Government was stepping up preparations for a disorderly Brexit, and warned “planes would not fly” in the event of a hard Brexit with no withdrawal agreement struck."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3571307.1532089086!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit may calls for eu to evolve position on unworkable backstop","story":"UK prime minister Theresa May has said that a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland \u0027cannot happen\u0027 after Brexit.

Photograph: EPAAidan CrawleyBritish prime minister Theresa May has reiterated her rejection of the Brexit backstop proposal and challenged the European Union to respond to her White Paper on Europe which she described as “principled and practical”.And in her speech in the Belfast Waterfront Hall on Friday and with senior DUP politicians in the front row she emphasised that her government would never be “neutral” on Northern Ireland’s union with Britain.In December the EU said it struck what Taoiseach Leo Varadkar described as a “bullet proof” backstop deal whereby in the absence of an overall UK-EU accommodation that Northern Ireland would remain in the customs union and have access to the single market while Britain would be outside such an agreement.On Friday on the second and final day of her Northern Ireland visit she reiterated that she could not accept this interpretation of the December deal because it would mean the creation of a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.“The economic and constitutional dislocation of a formal ‘third country’ customs border within our own country is something I will never accept and I believe no British prime minister could ever accept,” said Ms May.“And as they made clear this week, it is not something the House of Commons will accept either,” she added.She challenged the EU to reply to last week’s British government White Paper that proposes a free trade area in goods and agricultural products between the UK and the EU. She said it represented a “coherent package” and a “significant development” in the British position.“Early in this process, both sides agreed a clear desire to find solutions to the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland through a close future relationship,” said Ms May.“It is now for the EU to respond, not simply to fall back onto previous positions which have already been proven unworkable, but to evolve their position in kind,” she added.“The White Paper is our plan for the future. It is the way to the stronger and brighter tomorrow that I know awaits the whole United Kingdom. Now we must have the courage and the determination to seize it,” she said.Ms May said the White Paper proposals “will also protect and strengthen our union by ensuring there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and no border in the UK”.With DUP leader Arlene Foster and colleagues Nigel Dodds and Emma Little Pengelly in the audience Ms May spoke about her commitment to the union and how her party’s name was the “Conservative and Unionist Party”.“And, as we leave the European Union, I have made protecting and strengthening our own precious Union, by making sure the deal we strike works for every part of the UK, an absolute priority,” she said.“I believe in the partnership of our four great nations in one proud union and I want it to endure for generations to come. So a government I lead will never be neutral in our support for the union. We will always make the case for it,” she added.Ms May said she also respected that a substantial section of the Northern Ireland population identified as Irish and aspired to a united Ireland.“I will always govern in the interests of the whole community in Northern Ireland and not just one part of it,” she said. “We are absolutely committed to parity of esteem, and just and equal treatment irrespective of aspiration or identity.”On the possibility of Ian Paisley being suspended from the House of Commons for failing to disclose two family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan she was asked was she worried about losing one of the 10 DUP MP votes that are propping up her government.She sidestepped the question saying it was a matter for the House of Commons to decide what penalty should be imposed on the North Antrim MP. She also said the confidence and supply agreement with the DUP was “delivering key decisions that are important across the whole of the United Kingdom”.Earlier on Friday Ms May met a Sinn Féin delegation led by party leader Mary Lou McDonald, who said the engagement was “anything but reassuring”.“In fact it’s now clear the British prime minister has come here to pick a fight with Ireland and to pick a fight with the EU,” said Ms McDonald.After Ms May’s later Waterfront speech Ms Foster welcomed her comments about the union. She described Ms McDonald’s complaint as “nonsense”.Ms Foster agreed with the British prime minister, saying it was now up to the EU to come up with “innovative and flexible solutions” on the hard border question.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The onus was on the UK – and there is an acceptance of that reality in the UK, he said – to respond to detailed European Commission proposals for the Irish protocol to the Withdrawal Agreement.

He said that “we know from the British prime minister in Northern Ireland today that she does not want to see any border infrastructure in place . . . and that she wants a solution that’s consistent with the agreement in December.That “backstop” agreement stated that, in the absence of another solution for the Border, Northern Ireland would effectively remain within the EU customs union.“So we need to see a wording that is legally operable so that we can get some confidence into the system of negotiations.” He said that the British White Paper “deserves and needs serious consideration”. He urged the “intensification of the technical discussions” with British representatives, and echoed Mr Barnier’s call in respect of controls in the Irish Sea for a “dedramatisation” of some of the issues.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Aidan Crawley BloombergFor many in the aviation industry and in Europe, the Taoiseach’s comment that UK planes “would not fly” in the event of a no-deal Brexit was nothing more than a statement of fact.“The situation at the moment is that the United Kingdom is part of the single European sky, and if they leave the EU they are not, and that does mean that if there was a no-deal, hard Brexit next March, the planes would not fly and Britain would be an island in many ways and that is something that they need to think about,” Leo Varadkar said in Kerry three days ago.“You cannot have your cake and eat it. You can’t take back your waters and then expect to use other people’s sky.”On the pro-Brexit side his comments were interpreted as an attempt at blackmail a threat that if British prime minister Theresa May insists on taking back exclusive fishing rights for British waters, our revenge will be to unilaterally close the skies.Conservative MEP David Bannerman called Varadkar’s comments “shameful blackmail” while DUP MLA Christopher Stalford tweeted: “Hilarious! Does he actually think anyone with half an ounce of sense or self-respect would be bullied by the likes of this?”The harshest response came from the Sun newspaper which on Friday branded the Taoiseach “an airhead” (quoting Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg) and “a fool”.The paper’s editorial read: “Varadkar must believe that these grenades he brainlessly lobs into the Brexit negotiations help Brussels. He is not bright enough to realise how absurd and unstatesmanlike he looks.” It is not the first time the UK tabloid has had a go at Varadkar over his perceived intransigence on Brexit a previous editorial called him “gobby” and advised him to “grow up”.What most of this commentary appears to ignore is that if there is a no-deal Brexit, and that is a growing possibility, Britain will leave the European Union and all its accompanying regulations and treaties, with no arrangements to take their place, including in the area of air travel.This is not a threat from the Taoiseach, it is an obvious fact. No deal means UK airlines will be effectively barred from the airspace of every remaining country in the union.Varadkar is repeating what has been said by many others including the head of Ryanair, Michael O’Leary, himself no great fan of the EU. O’Leary warned earlier this year that planes might not fly between the European Union and the UK after the March 2019 deadline for Brexit.More importantly, the European Commission and the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) have said UK flights will be unable to land in any EU country in the absence of a new deal. “If a hard Brexit occurs, there would need to be a new agreement in place to maintain the existing level of connectivity between Europe and the UK,” an IAA spokesman told The .Looking to the World Trade Organisation would be pointless, he said. Its treaties do not cover the aviation industry.Downing Street points to the Chicago Convention to which both Ireland and the UK have signed up. However, that guarantees only the rights of airlines to fly over countries, not to land or take off from them.The current EU aviation system, with its low fares and wide variety of choice, is probably taken for granted today. It is forgotten that we got to this point by way of decades of complex negotiations and treaties which make it possible to travel to Barcelona for less than the price of the train to Cork.The 1992 package of reforms, which came about largely because of the work of the UK, was probably the most important step in that process. It severely limited State aid to flag carrier airlines and opened the way for the Ryanairs and Easyjets of Europe to revolutionise the industry.The next big leap forward was the 2007 EU-US Open Skies Agreement which greatly increased the number of flights to and from America which led to significantly lower fares.The EU also has Open Sky-style agreements with 16 other non-EU countries including Canada, Norway and Israel.That means if there is a no-deal Brexit, the UK will also have to renegotiate arrangements with every one of these countries inidually. Negotiations with the US have already started with early reports suggesting the UK will get a worse deal than it currently enjoys as part of the EU.Most observers believe some sort of air-traffic arrangement will be agreed between the EU and the UK, even in the event of an otherwise “no-deal” Brexit simply because the alternative is so unthinkable.But if we have learned anything since June 2016, when the British people voted to leave the EU, it is to prepare for the unthinkable.

You can’t take back your waters and then expect to use other people’s sky.”The UK tabloid, which has a circulation of 1.6 million, chose to interpret this as Mr Varadkar threatening to ban air travel in revenge for British Prime Minister Theresa May stopping Irish fisherman accessing UK waters.It quotes the vocal pro-Brexit conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg as saying: “His words are those of an airhead.”The headline does not appear in the Irish edition of the paper which, although owned by the same organisation, has its own newsroom based in Dublin.An article on the Irish Sun’s website takes a more sober tone. “Taoiseach warns a hard Brexit may mean planes leaving the UK may not be allowed to fly over Ireland airspace”, the headline reads.An editorial inside the UK version of the paper also calls the Taoiseach “a fool” and “a bigmouth” and said his “latest tantrum exposes Brussels’ intentions to keep us in its grip.”It continues: “Imagine the cataclysmic self-harm of Ireland preventing planes from its biggest trading partner flying over it. And the impossibility of its own airlines avoiding UK airspace. It won’t happen.“Varadkar must believe that these grenades he brainlessly lobs into the Brexit negotiations help Brussels. He is not bright enough to realise how absurd and unstatesmanlike he looks.”The Sun, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, has been one of the most pro-Brexit newspapers since the UK voted to leave the European Union in June 2016. It has previously attacked the Taoiseach and other Irish politicians over what it sees as their intransigence on Brexit negotiations. Previous editorials have called Mr Varadkar “gobby” and told him “shut your gob and grow up”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

I love my sister and the NHS saved her life, so when I say I love the NHS, I really mean it.Just Madders, shadow health minister, said refusal to commit to critical NHS targets was a “betrayal” of patients.Gavin Williamson urges Theresa May to cut taxes like Donald Trump and Nigel Lawson Cabinet at war over freedom of movement as Philip Hammond says EU workers should get \u0026#39preferential treatment\u0026#39 Fifty firefighters tackle Edmonton Tower block blaze in North London UN urges Israel and Hamas to \u0026#39step back from brink\u0026#39 as fighting escalates in GazaSchoolboys who plotted Columbine-style massacre named as judge says internet \u0026#39poisoned their minds\u0026#39Warden who fixed roof of church targeted by lead thieves ends up in court for failing to get permissionChildren will be able to watch porn on social media sites because of loophole in rules, BBFC admitsNovichok victim Charlie Rowley discharged from Salisbury hospital three weeks after poisoningCambodian tycoons set for victory in controversial poll, claims rights groupFoster parents to be told it is OK to hug children and take them for haircutsHow Trump surprises his staff with his decisionsFBI seize recordings between Donald Trump and his lawyer discussing payment to Playboy modelPrince Charles shows off proud grandpa credentials as he puts unseen family photo on displayToblerone bars to revert back to original design Stay away from this \u0026#39world class\u0026#39 Welsh beach, National Trust tells holiday makersKnife attack on German bus: At least 14 wounded in stabbing in city of LuebeckComment: Should we defend little Montenegro?

They had been found guilty at Leeds Crown Court  of conspiracy to murder.The schoolboys hero-worshipped Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the American teenagers who carried out the infamous Columbine massacre in Colorado in 1999.Wyllie and Bolland, who were arrested when aged just 14, had devised their own plan for their school in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, drawing up a revenge “hit list” of students and teachers who had either bullied or wronged them. They had also downloaded bomb-making manuals off the internet and attempted to obtain guns and ammunition.Wyllie, who was given a 12-year jail term, was motivated by a far-Right “twisted ideology” and had set up a fake Instagram account with Nazi imagery.  Items including petrol, a bag of screws and a balaclava were found in an abandoned shed used by the boys as a hideawayIn a notebook recovered from the teenager’s home in October 2017, Wyllie apologised in advance for either committing “one of the worst atrocities in British history” or killing himself. He had kept a rucksack filled with screws, boards and flammable liquid at a secret hideout at Catterick Garrison. Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb, in lifting the order allowing the boys to be named, said in sentencing Wyllie: “You saw yourself as somebody outside the system, someone special. You modelled yourself on the apparent leader of the Columbine pair, Eric Harris and Alex Bolland was to take up the somewhat subsidiary role of Dylan Klebold.”Sentencing Bolland to a 10-year term, she said: “You were bullied over a period of years and it had a profound impact on you. The school authorities failed to take your complaints seriously and failed you badly.“But that was no justification for what you planned.”Wyllie wrote in his diary about his desire to carry out an attackOf their obsession on the ‘Dark Web’ with the Columbine massacre, the judge warned: “It is self evident that the unchecked consumption of such material on the internet is capable of poisoning young minds to such an extent that two disaffected murderers who killed themselves after ending the lives of innocent people can become the focus of adulation and imitation.”Both boys’ parents sat in the public gallery as sentencing was delivered. Only Bolland’s mother wept.According to Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, the bullying suffered by Bolland had motivated the plot, saying: “In other words, they were driven by a desire for revenge.”The planned attack came to the attention of teachers in September 2017 after a Snapchat conversation with a girl revealing the plot was brought to the attention of teachers. However, the pair were not arrested until October 2017, after Wyllie’s secret hideout was discovered by police.Wyllie was also convicted of the unlawful wounding of a teenage girl.In a statement after the boys were found guilty, North Yorkshire Police said it had instituted a review over its initial response to the allegations. Asst Chief Constable Phil Cain said: “We fully accept that standards of investigation and our initial responses to some of the incidents did not meet those standards that are expected of us.“A senior officer has since reviewed the issues and addressed these with a number of officers and staff.”Gavin Williamson urges Theresa May to cut taxes like Donald Trump and Nigel Lawson Cabinet at war over freedom of movement as Philip Hammond says EU workers should get \u0026#39preferential treatment\u0026#39 Fifty firefighters tackle Edmonton Tower block blaze in North London UN urges Israel and Hamas to \u0026#39step back from brink\u0026#39 as fighting escalates in GazaWarden who fixed roof of church targeted by lead thieves ends up in court for failing to get permissionA\u0026ampE four-hour target in doubt as new health secretary Matt Hancock promises to listen to NHS leadersChildren will be able to watch porn on social media sites because of loophole in rules, BBFC admitsNovichok victim Charlie Rowley discharged from Salisbury hospital three weeks after poisoningCambodian tycoons set for victory in controversial poll, claims rights groupFoster parents to be told it is OK to hug children and take them for haircutsHow Trump surprises his staff with his decisionsFBI seize recordings between Donald Trump and his lawyer discussing payment to Playboy modelPrince Charles shows off proud grandpa credentials as he puts unseen family photo on displayToblerone bars to revert back to original design Stay away from this \u0026#39world class\u0026#39 Welsh beach, National Trust tells holiday makersKnife attack on German bus: At least 14 wounded in stabbing in city of LuebeckComment: Should we defend little Montenegro?

The Queen has not visited, and has already made the journey to Scotland for her summer trip to Balmoral.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex at their weddingVanessa Remington, senior curator of paintings at the Royal Collection Trust, said: It\u0027s a departure because it is not a standard museum display and the works aren\u0027t shown in isolation, they\u0027re shown in profusion very, very densely. (Tables) are dressed with a range of objects and those are intended to show or give a flavour of the interiors of the Prince of Wales\u0027s own residences because this is a very personal show.The Prince and Patron exhibitionSpeaking about one of the highlights of the exhibition, Napoleon Bonaparte\u0027s red felt hooded cloak, the Prince said: Since, as a child, I first caught sight of this cloak in the Grand Vestibule at Windsor, I have been fascinated by the sheer magic of the colour, the dashing pattern of the lining and the enthralling story of Napoleon himself which it conjures up.It is said to have been worn by the Emperor during his Egyptian campaign and was taken from his carriage after the Battle of Waterloo 15 years later.The exhibition is laid out in a rectangular roomHe also tell visitors via audio guide: I am very fond of the two preparatory oil sketches of my sons which I acquired from the artist, Nicky Philipps, in 2009.They were painted for a double portrait that now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery. Both are dressed in the regimental uniform of the Household Cavalry - the Blues and Royals - and are particularly good likenesses.The summer opening of Buckingham Palace, which includes the Prince \u0026amp Patron exhibition, opens on Saturday and runs until September 30.Please review our commenting policyGavin Williamson urges Theresa May to cut taxes like Donald Trump and Nigel Lawson Cabinet at war over freedom of movement as Philip Hammond says EU workers should get \u0026#39preferential treatment\u0026#39 Fifty firefighters tackle Edmonton Tower block blaze in North London UN urges Israel and Hamas to \u0026#39step back from brink\u0026#39 as fighting escalates in GazaSchoolboys who plotted Columbine-style massacre named as judge says internet \u0026#39poisoned their minds\u0026#39Warden who fixed roof of church targeted by lead thieves ends up in court for failing to get permissionA\u0026ampE four-hour target in doubt as new health secretary Matt Hancock promises to listen to NHS leadersChildren will be able to watch porn on social media sites because of loophole in rules, BBFC admitsNovichok victim Charlie Rowley discharged from Salisbury hospital three weeks after poisoningCambodian tycoons set for victory in controversial poll, claims rights groupFoster parents to be told it is OK to hug children and take them for haircutsHow Trump surprises his staff with his decisionsFBI seize recordings between Donald Trump and his lawyer discussing payment to Playboy modelToblerone bars to revert back to original design Stay away from this \u0026#39world class\u0026#39 Welsh beach, National Trust tells holiday makersKnife attack on German bus: At least 14 wounded in stabbing in city of LuebeckComment: Should we defend little Montenegro?

In 2013, Burberry incinerated £5.5m of unwanted stock, less than a fifth of last year’s total.“The stuff that Burberry is burning is not waste – it is surplus, which is a very different concept. It is perfectly useable stuff,” said Orsola de Castro, cofounder of Fashion Revolution, a not-for-profit group that campaigns for greater transparency in the supply chain.The fashion designer told The Independent clothing brands destroying “vast quantities” of stock was a “massive, massive issue” that was “absolutely not unique to Burberry”.“In the case of the big brands, it’s absolutely very negative for them to suddenly have the same product with slashed prices,” she said.“Burberry, I can imagine, is particularly concerned about this because we all know that it went through a huge image change from sort of shabby to high gloss, high fashion. So they are probably worried about making things cheap and rolling back the clock.“It is brand protection, in this case. They don’t want it to go to the wrong people.”Burberry’s clothes are priced at the high end of fashion retail, with men’s polo shirts selling for as much as £250 and its famous trench coats priced at around £1,500.The company also sells perfumes and cosmetics, which accounted for £10.4m of the products destroyed last year.Fashion Revolution in picturesDestroying stock has become common practice for the industry, with retailers describing it as a measure to protect intellectual property and prevent illegal counterfeiting.Burberry\u0026nbspsaid it only destroyed items that carried its trademark and only worked with specialist companies who were able to harness the energy from the process.A spokesman said: “Burberry has careful processes in place to minimise the amount of excess stock we produce.\u0026nbspOn the occasions when disposal of products is necessary, we do so in a responsible manner and we continue to seek ways to reduce and revalue our waste.”\u0026nbspBurberry\u0026nbsprecently joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Make Fashion Circular initiative to help prevent waste in the industry, he added.Last year it emerged a Swedish power plant was burning unwanted H\u0026ampM clothes instead of coal.\u0026nbspThe plant in Vasteras, northwest of Stockholm, incinerated 15 tonnes of the retailer’s products in the first 11 months of the year.H\u0026ampM stressed it did not burn “any clothes that are safe to use” and said much of the destroyed stock was mouldy\u0026nbspor contaminated with lead.Ms De Castro called on the industry to be more open about the amount of clothing that was going to waste.She added: “We need to slow down. It doesn’t need to be drastic but it does need to happen, because whatever Burberry does with this stuff is not going to be environmentally friendly. There is no way of disposing of this amount of clothing in a way that is not environmentally invasive.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

With an estimated worth of $1bn, a trade body and a recognised marketing award, they have finally been tamedClick to followThe Independent OnlinePep talk: Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi advert was pulled shortly after it aired for appearing to trivialise demonstrations tackling social causesLast month, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity –\u0026nbspthe biggest grouping of advertising and marketing people you could ever hope to avoid –\u0026nbspintroduced a new award: the Social and Influencer\u0026nbspcategory.Yes, those\u0026nbspgurning thumb-flexers forever punching #YOLO, #instacool and #nofilter into their smartphones as they plug products have come of age.\u0026nbspInfluencer-dom is now a fully-fledged industry. Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point. Beauty influencer Emily Weiss now has a cosmetic company, Glossier, and within the last couple of weeks M\u0026ampC Saatchi bought a stake in two influencer agencies.

They’ve hired almost a thousand customs officials just in case Britain crashes out.“We’re a trading nation we cannot afford our customs system to completely get stuck because from one day to the next we also have to check all the British exports of goods and services. We also hired veterinary officials because if you crash out, you also have that problem.”Dutch port officials told The Independent this year the Netherlands’\u0026nbspcustoms authorities were aiming to hire between 750 and 930 officials – suggesting the number actually hired is right at the upper end of that early estimate as talks look increasingly likely to fail.On Friday, ministers from the remaining 27 EU states are expected to be presented with a dossier drawn up by the European Commission laying out how to plan for a “no deal” Brexit.\u0026nbspWe cannot afford our customs system to completely get stuck because from one day to the next we also have to check all the British exportsThe Netherlands has been amongst the best prepared EU member states regarding Brexit, with ports like Rotterdam and hub airports like Schipol planning significant physical changes to accommodate the extra checks likely to slow down trade following Britain’s departure.Preparations in the UK are behind schedule for a “no deal” scenario, with huge overflow lorry parks needed to accommodate freight in Kent not expected to be completed in time if Britain does crash out.Mr Omtzigt was scathing at the UK’s lack of preparations for its Brexit talks and the timing of the white paper outlining the nation’s Brexit ambitions: “I share concerns that it’s a bit late in the day, that one year and four months after tabling the Article 50 notification, the UK makes a proposal.“I think it’s a proposal that’s a good starting point for negotiations – but it’s a proposal to start negotiations. It would have been helpful that that had been on the table the day the negotiations started.”Ms May\u0026nbsphas repeatedly said “no deal is better than a bad deal” and threatened to lead the UK off an economic cliff edge if she does not get her way in talks with the EU.Asked whether the UK was hiring more customs officers, cabinet office minister David Lidington\u0026nbspsaid: “I think that all governments, including the United Kingdom government, have to plan for all contingencies.”Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Only the ruling\u0026nbspUnited Russia fraction voted for, with all of the controlled “opposition” parties voting against.\u0026nbspSeveral deputies in the ruling party, hitherto known for demonstrative displays of loyalty, were mysteriously absent from the vote.\u0026nbspThe main provisions of the reform see the pension age increase from 60 for men and 55 for women, to 65 and 63 respectively. Its sponsors say the changes are necessary to bring the law into line with new life expectancy figures. Pension ages were last set in 1936, when pensioners accounted for no more than 2 per cent of the population. \u0026nbsp“Life has changed,”\u0026nbspthe employment\u0026nbspminister\u0026nbspMaxim\u0026nbspTopilin\u0026nbsptold parliamentarians. “We can’t remain in the 1930s.”\u0026nbspThe contentious issue of pension reform has been raised several times in the last two decades, but the government has repeatedly chosen to delay. It presented the bill in\u0026nbspless than auspicious economic times. Most Russians have faced real-terms wage falls since 2014, and the outlook is grim.\u0026nbspMr Putin’s trust ratings have\u0026nbspfallen to the lowest recorded ebb since 2011 – below 38 percent, according to state pollsters.Critics have also railed against the way the pensions plan was communicated, announced with no discussion a few hours before kick off during the opening match of the World Cup, between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia. Fnance\u0026nbspminister Anton Siluanov has insisted that this was a coincidence, but the public outcry was real.\u0026nbsp“It is a bastardly way to introduce reform,” said the former Kremlin adviser Gleb Pavlovsky in an interview on the Echo of Moscow radio station. “The people have a deal with the Kremlin in return for not protesting – and the most important part of that deal is that they are given the chance to survive.”\u0026nbspIn some regions\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspproposed pension ages fall below average life expectancy\u0026nbsp– in Chukotka,\u0026nbspin the country’s far east, the male life expectancy is 60.33, nearly five years below the proposed pension age.\u0026nbspFor many families\u0026nbspthe change will represent a fundamental shift to their way of life. Even according to state pollsters, eight out of\u0026nbsp10 Russians do not agree with the plans. There have already been\u0026nbspprotests against the reform.\u0026nbspOn the eve of the bill, 14 people were arrested at an unsanctioned rally in St Petersburg.\u0026nbspRegardless of whether significant protests follow, the relationship between the people and the state has changed forever,\u0026nbspsays the political analyst Ekaterina Schulmann\u0026nbsp“It is a tectonic shift. Even before the pension reform, people were viewing the state as less and less of a father figure. But the reform strengthens that perception.”In Ms Schulmann\u0027s view, these changes will affect the transfer of power between Vladimir Putin and his anointed successor, a process which may begin as early as 2021.\u0026nbspThe paw of Mr Putin has remained strangely hidden throughout the process. His press secretary,\u0026nbspDmitry Peskov, has distanced the president from the unpopular bill.\u0026nbspReports, on the other\u0026nbsphand, suggested the president approved the plan before its first reading. And all the while, state media have been kept under strict control. They have been told to avoid the word “reform”, to avoid associations with the “chaotic” 1990s, but nonetheless to keep close to a line emphasising the necessity of reform.\u0026nbspThere may not be protests, but the relationship between the people and the state has changed forever\u0026nbspBut the attempt to differentiate a\u0026nbspgood tsar from bad\u0026nbspboyars might not have been altogether successful.On the back of the controversy, trust\u0026nbspin Mr Putin has fallen to\u0026nbspthe lowest recorded\u0026nbspebb since 2011 – below 38 percent, according to state pollsters. And perhaps more significantly, the president’s ratings are falling steadily\u0026nbspin line with government popularity. This is the first time this has happened since the annexation of Crimea in 2014.\u0026nbspSome now wonder if the president is in danger of losing his Teflon coating.\u0026nbspIt may, of course, have been another coincidence, but on the eve and the day of the vote\u0026nbspthe Russian military released several videos purporting to show the testing of new cutting-edge “Avangard” and “Kinzhal” missiles. Russians are generally supportive of the president’s assertive foreign policy stance – as opposed to domestic policies with which they interact with every day.Propaganda directors may have decided to use the opportunity to play down\u0026nbspreaction to the proposal.\u0026nbspWelcome to the real Russia, on eve of electionRussia\u0027s imperial capital is the starting point of our journey Chudovo was one of the first stops of Radishchev\u0027s journeyThey say the fish rot from the head down429 On the way out of ChudovoWe choose our president, we choose our futurePeople have become fussy and want clear waterLife is just great Once the seat of a forward-looking republic — Russia\u0027s first experiment with democracy Once the seat of a forward-looking republic — Russia\u0027s first experiment with democracy Once the seat of a forward-looking republic — Russia\u0027s first experiment with democracy Navalny\u0027s activists continue campaign despite their leader being barred from the elections Thatcher was a bitch, but I liked her.

But this surely depends upon what the other possibilities are. This deserves the serious analysis that Mrs May and her team have apparently not given it.There are broadly two options. The first is to accept one of the off-the-shelf arrangements. The one that most closely accords with achieving a full Brexit, corresponding to what people voted for two years ago, is the recently agreed EU deal with Canada.This is not ideal for us, but it is pretty good. It might be possible to add some bells and whistles that extend the scope of the agreement, particularly with regard to services. This is what is known as “Canada plus”.With or without the plus, this would give us tariff and barrier-free trade between the EU and the UK while ending free movement of people, the payment of substantial sums to Brussels each year and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, while enabling us to sign FTAs with whoever we wanted to.Interestingly, the EU offered us the Canada deal earlier this year but this was turned down by the Prime Minister, supposedly because it wasn’t ambitious enough and because it would not provide a solution to the supposed “problems” concerning the Irish border.Since then, Mrs May’s ambitions have decayed to the delivery of abject surrender while not saying so.As to the Irish border, it has been clear for some time that these “problems” have been manufactured by the Remain-leaning establishment precisely as a way of blocking a full Brexit.There is no need for a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. It is perfectly possible for goods to move freely across the border, relying on pre-registration and subsequent random checks.There is already a soft border between the Irish republic and Northern Ireland with regard to currencies, duties and tax rates. This would continue.Of course, it is possible that the EU will not now agree to something like the Canada deal. And the clock is ticking.In that case, there is another perfectly viable option, namely “no deal”. After all, as Mrs May used to say, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.In fact, this “no deal” expression is potentially misleading. It doesn’t mean that we couldn’t or shouldn’t have a deal on anything with the EU, including landing rights for planes, participation in various joint bodies, etc.What it means is simply that we would leave the EU without an agreement on trade, and operate under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.The WTO option is widely misunderstood. It should hold no terrors for us. We currently do the bulk of our trade with non-EU countries under WTO rules. And if we left the EU without a deal we would not have to hand over the £39billion “divorce settlement”.Moreover, the WTO option leaves substantial areas of policy choice, including over what our tariffs are. We could decide to drop tariffs on particular goods but not others for instance, on cars, which currently incur tariffs at ten per cent, and/or on car components, where the rate is five per cent.Or we could decide, unilaterally, to drop all our tariffs to zero.We could start to negotiate FTAs immediately. Just because we fail to secure a trade deal with the EU before next March does not mean we can never secure such a deal.Indeed, we could put the EU “at the front of the queue” for trade deals. We would be able to conduct negotiations without the pressures emanating from the ticking clock imposed, arbitrarily and ridiculously, under the Lisbon Treaty.Of course, trading under WTO rules would still leave the much-dreaded “trade frictions” and possible delays at the border as we lose the supposedly huge advantages of Single Market membership. But these frictions have been massively overblown by the UK establishment. WTO rules oblige members (including the EU) to facilitate frictionless trade.John Mills, the Eurosceptic economist and Labour donor, has come up with estimates of border costs that are a fraction of the official ones.His view is especially worth noting because, unlike the civil servants behind the official view, he runs his own very successful business importing large amounts of consumer goods. I know whose estimates I believe.Some critics will say that this is all very well for finished goods, but not for the businesses that operate complex supply chains. To listen to them you would think that these only operate within the EU.In fact there are complex supply chains operating across the world. They seem to manage without common currencies, single markets and all the other paraphernalia so beloved by the EU.Meanwhile, umpteen countries around the world sell huge amounts into the EU without being members of the Single Market. How do they manage to overcome those pesky barriers, I wonder?Whatever difficulties may occur in the immediate aftermath of a full Brexit, this does not represent the final destination.

It would have kept us shackled to Brussels’ rules for all time, with no say over any of them.All the ambition for our great country as a newly independent global trader would have been swept away. We would have all the possible short-term pain of leaving, with no long-term gain.Theresa May’s Chequers plan is a feeble Brexit, but at least it’s freedom of a sort. That cannot be said of a customs union.It was repugnant to watch Westminster’s Remainer elite line up to argue for tying us to the EU, and pretend the Leave verdict didn’t mean actually leaving.Many seemed to treat it like a game, oblivious to the terrible danger they would have unleashed had they won.For once, and however briefly, the Government has something to celebrate.OF all the attempts to thwart Brexit, the campaign to pretend the referendum wasn’t fair is the most pathetic and dishonest.The Electoral Commission’s probe into Vote Leave’s alleged overspending is fatally flawed if it failed even to interview those who ran it.Worse, it has not applied the same scrutiny to the Remain camp, which clearly co-ordinated smaller groups just as Vote Leave is said to have done.As for Remainers claiming this alleged overspend skewed a tight referendum, what cobblers. The Commission’s own figures show Remain vastly outspent Leave — on top of the £9million David Cameron wasted leafleting every home begging us to vote to stay in.The odds were massively stacked against Leave and they still won.This Remain rearguard action has nothing to do with the vote’s legitimacy.It is just a continuing tantrum, aimed at the 17.4million who disagreed with them.IMAGINE the outrage if a newspaper hosted online videos of kids being abused.Facebook does, and refuses to remove them.

Blow after blow rains down on her authority. She is battered and bruised by her own party yet refuses to realise her time is up.The past few days have brought yet more resignations. Following the Foreign Secretary and the Brexit Secretary are ministers whose names escape me let’s call them Cuthbert, Dibble and Grubb.Though hardly well known, these MPs have grandly flounced off in protest at May’s handling of Brexit.In a particularly odd development, one is leaving the Government because he thinks the Government is not sticking to the spirit of government policy.All this on top of last week’s embarrassment, courtesy of Donald Trump. The President might have softened his comments about the Prime Minister and the “turmoil” afflicting the UK but the damage to May’s authority was done.God knows how this looks to the rest of the world. We used to bestride the international stage like a colossus now we stumble across it like Frank Spencer.The Prime Minister can’t take all the blame. She has been dealt a difficult hand — her party and the country split on Brexit, Europe turning the thumbscrews and Ukip waiting in the wings to hoover up Tory votes. It would be hard for any politician to make an outright success of this.But where Theresa May HAS failed categorically is on communicating her plans to the British people.The Chequers deal should have been a big moment. She should have been all over the TV stations selling this deal hard.In the past, prime ministers held public broadcasts to explain important matters to the people. Anthony Eden gave one on the Suez crisis, Harold Wilson on the devaluation of the Pound. Ted Heath warned in 1973 that the nation faced “the hardest Christmas that we have known since the war”.These leaders looked the nation in the eye, spoke directly to the British people — and LED.Theresa May, on the other hand, seems reluctant to get out and make the case for her own policy.Little wonder that two thirds of the public questioned on the Chequers deal were baffled by it. Confusion reigns.This points to a major problem with May’s premiership. She is hopeless at telling a national story.It’s the job of a leader not just to make decisions but to inspire the nation. For the person in No10, their words speak as loudly as their actions. They need to tell a compelling story about where Britain is going.Margaret Thatcher told the story of Britain emerging from the ashes of socialism thanks to the hard work and enterprise of its people: “A get-up-and-go instead of a sit-back-and-wait-for- it Britain.”Tony Blair told the story of Britain shrugging off the past and embracing the modern world: “A new Britain . . . a model 21st-century nation, based not on privilege, class or background, but on the equal worth of all.”David Cameron told the story of Britain clearing up the economic mess left by Labour, paying down our debts and living within our means.Love or loathe these leaders, at least they told a clear story about where Britain was going. We get none of this from May.She makes a virtue of just “getting on with the job”. But in a nation divided on Brexit, we desperately need more. We need a clear sense of direction for Britain’s future.Of course, the Prime Minister cannot last for much longer. In boxing terms she’s in the 12th round. Before long there will be a leadership contest — and those hoping to succeed May must learn from where she went wrong.The next resident of No10 must not only have the right policies but the right vision.If Britain is to regain its reputation abroad, and its self-respect at home, we urgently need a Prime Minister who inspires, who tells a national story — and who truly leads.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These were heavy things to say.Welsh dairy farmer Luke Winton went viral on Twitter last month after saying he had been threatened by another bunch of verbally abusive vegans.Ive had a number of threats on social media, and I know other farmers who have experienced the same thing, Luke tells Sun Online.It can be really scary. Recently, I had somebody threaten to come to the farm and shoot me - and Ive been called a rapist too.As a young person who has only been working in the industry a short time, I am terrified - and it seems the law isnt doing anything to help us.Im scared of vegans coming to the farm - and even stealing animals.They might think theyre saving an animal, but the truth is they might not know how to look after a cow properly, how to feed it or what injections it needs, says Luke.With the growing popularity of veganism, Luke says things have only been escalating - and he is constantly worried that somebody will come to his farm and attack him.Theres people trying to drive me out of my job. Some days, it makes you wonder why you do this - but Im trying not to let them stop me working.What activists such as Carbstrong would like to see is a move to a completely plant-based diet for everybody - something that would change the nature of farming and put many out of business.A spokesperson for The Vegan Society say they promote campaigns to help farmers transition to plant-based agriculture.Vegans rely on farmers for food and we want to work with farmers to see an end to animal agriculture as a whole, they say.However, farmers such as Luke Wilton remain concerned about their futures as more people adopt the diet.I see the vegans points, I really do, he says. But there is currently consumer demand for meat, eggs and dairy and we are providing the country with food.Its getting to the point now where I am getting used to the abuse.

Sadly, a year or so later they also voted to keep the appalling Anna Soubry as their local MP. Let’s hope they never make that mistake again.For the last year this bilious, jabbering woman has done everything she possibly can to thwart the will of her electors.She is a staunch Remainer and is seemingly prepared to bring down the Government to get her way. Her actions suggest she couldn’t give a monkey’s about what the people in her constituency think.Two nights ago she was one of 12 Conservative rebels who voted against the Government. She wanted Britain to remain part of a customs union with the EU. That would mean — effectively — no real Brexit. And if they had won, it would have been catastrophe for the Government. And in my opinion, the country.The reason they didn’t lose is solely down to a bunch of courageous Labour MPs, including the excellent Frank Field, who voted with the Government. Soubry isn’t alone, of course. The people of Loughborough, Leics, also voted by a large margin to leave the EU.But they are represented in the House of Commons by Nicky Morgan, who appears not to give a toss what they think. She also voted for a customs union. Nicky is famous among many for being the second worst Education Secretary this country has ever had. She’s pipped to the post for that particular prize by Justine Greening.Being useless in their Cabinet posts isn’t the only thing that unites these two women. Greening is also opposed to Brexit and she has even called for a second referendum. Because she didn’t like the result of the first one.The people of Beaconsfield, Bucks, voted to leave the EU. But their MP, the grim Dominic Grieve, who resembles a funeral director from about 1923, appears not to care less. He has said he’s prepared to “collapse” the Government if he does not get his way.Sarah Wollaston is another one. Another embittered MP. Her constituency, Totnes in Devon, voted to leave by a sizeable margin.Because while it is true that the majority of Labour MPs are also opposed to Brexit, they have been nothing like as dangerous as the Tory rebels.We are in a mess. The Prime Minister staggers from crisis to crisis, striking meaningless deals whenever she can to stave off defeat for a few more days.She surely cannot last much longer. A Remainer herself, of course, I think she should be persuaded to call it a day. Go home, put her feet up. And let her party elect a leader who will take no more c**p from Brussels.And no more c**p from the likes of Soubry and Greening, either.THE top scientist Richard Dawkins – Britain’s most famous atheist – has got himself into trouble.He has said that he prefers to hear the sound of cathedral bells to the muezzin wail calling Muslims to prayer.  Saying something as inoffensive as that is enough to get you into hot water these days.Dawkins has been called a bigot as a consequence. I have to say I disagree with him. I love the sound of cathedral bells, sure.But I also enjoying hearing the Muslim call to prayer – when I’ve been on my travels in Morocco or Malaysia. But, over here, it’s cathedral bells for me every time.Here’s a tip, then.Take them to an expensive shoe shop and make them look at the display through the window.And remember the noise they make.KATIE PRICE is on holiday in Thailand and of course she’s got her baps out.  This might be a problem for Katie, pictured with boyfriend Kris Boyson.Topless sunbathing is against the law over there. This is because tourists enjoy looking at the scenic islands. Without having their view obliterated by a pair of breasts the size of Koh Samui.So watch yourself, Katie. And as a break from lying on the beach, how do you fancy a spot of caving?YOU’VE got to love the toffs, haven’t you?  Most of them are absolutely crazy after years of inbreeding.Take the brilliant Lizzie Purbrick who described herself as “a very well-bred toff”.  She went round to her married lover’s home after he’d cheated on her with a third woman.No messing with Lizzie. She took with her eight litres of pig’s blood which she sprayed across his flat. She daubed the words “slut” and “whore” and “big d**k lord” on his walls and sprayed a giant penis on the floor.  She said: “So many people have said I should write my life story, but I’m so bonkers I can’t remember it.”The judge said – in one of the great under-statements of the decade – that she had “real concerns about the defendant’s ability to make rational decisions”.No s**t, Sherlock.It started out a few years back with just a couple of stalls. Now the entire town centre is closed off and thousands turn up to pig themselves on cuisine from scores of nationalities.I got so stuffed last year I needed to be helped home. And not a chicken parmo – the supposed Teesside dish of choice – in sight.IT’S not often that the Labour peer Dame Margaret Hodge says something worth repeating. But in telling her party leader Jeremy Corbyn that he was a “f***ing anti-Semite and a racist” I think she kinda hit the nail on the head.Meanwhile, the decent, moderate Labour MP John Woodcock has resigned the party whip and become an independent.Long-time party members – like I was, until last year – know that Labour is currently led by a hard-left anti-Jewish rabble of thickoes.I hope the voters twig this sooner or later.AND now it’s time for Hypocrites of the Week. A special award for Pimlico Plumbers of London.They’ve put up a giant banner outside their premises about Brexit, saying: “Nobody voted to be poorer!”Pimlico Plumbers has just lost a landmark case brought by one of its employees. He, like almost all of their staff, was kept on a contract which allowed the firm to pay him less than the proper rate.They were done under a UK Supreme Court decision, using laws designed to stop unscrupulous firms exploiting cheap labour.I wonder what it is about the EU that Pimlico Plumbers likes so much?

He said: “The situation at the moment is that the UK is part of the single European sky.“If they leave the EU they are not, and that does mean if there was a no-deal hard Brexit next March, the planes would not fly and Britain would be an island in many ways. If they want their planes to fly over our skies, they would need to take that into account.”The Ireland boss insisted: “You can’t have your cake and eat it. You can’t take back your waters and then expect to take back other people’s sky”.A DExEU spokesman said: “We do not want or expect a no deal scenario. Our White Paper sets out both our desire to agree a mechanism for annual negotiations on access to waters and fishing opportunities, as well as reciprocal liberalised aviation access with the EU through an Air Transport Agreement.”But a senior UK government source branded the comments “mad”.British officials pointed out that freedoms of the air are not guaranteed by the EU, but a multilateral international treaty – the International Air Services Transit Agreement - signed from 1944 onwards, by 133 countries.The only way Ireland can block British planes flying over it would be to pull out of the treaty, which it has been a signatory to since 1957. Others said Britain could retaliate by blocking Irish planes from flying to mainland Europe over the UK, doubling the length of their journies.The Director of the Open Europe think tank Henry Newman said Mr Varadkar is “in danger of losing the plot”.Alex Macheras, Aviation Analyst, said “It’s a ridiculous statement and the reason why ICAO’s International Air Services Transit Agreement exists - of which Ireland are signatory - which ensures countries cannot simply ‘impose a ban’ on their airspace, and the treaty specifically states that countries are forbidden from discriminating against the nationality of an aircraft.IRISH Prime Minister Leo Varadkar is a bigmouth and a fool, but his latest bone-headed outburst has done us all a favour.It has exposed beyond doubt both his crass naivety and the cynical deceit of the EU masters he cravenly obeys.Imagine the cataclysmic self-harm of Ireland preventing planes from its biggest trading partner flying over it. And the impossibility of its own airlines avoiding UK airspace. It won’t happen.Varadkar must believe that these grenades he brainlessly lobs into the Brexit negotiations help Brussels. He is not bright enough to realise how absurd and unstatesmanlike he looks.But he let something else very revealing slip too. Varadkar reportedly said that EU leaders have assured him no hard border or customs checks will ever be needed between Ireland and Northern Ireland. That’s under ANY scenario, including a No Deal.Since we will never build a hard border either, why is “avoiding” one still being discussed, let alone a huge sticking point?Answer: It is a ruse, confected by a Brussels desperate to keep us in its grip.“Ireland has very little airspace and if a ban were to take place Ireland would lose all flights operated to/from the country flown by aircraft with G- registrations, Great Britain. This is without mentioning that much of Ireland’s airspace management, and air traffic control, is actually based in the UK.”Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg told The Sun: Air traffic control continued between Russia and the Ukraine after Russia invaded the Crimea so this idea is just silly.On the other hand most flights from the EU to America pass through our air traffic control so this rather lightweight Irish gentleman is proposing an absurd act of a masochistic nature. His words are those of an airhead.Andrew Rossindell MP said: Who will this benefit? Mr Varadka needs to think very long and hard before he makes statements like this. Its incredibly damaging to British-Irish relations and very short-sighted. If he thinks this would benefit Ireland, he needs to think again. In reality it would just be catastrophic for everyone.If his ideological obsession with the EU means Ireland cant have sensible relations with its closest neighbour and friend, its a tragedy and totally outrageous. He should stop taking his orders from Brussels and start thinking about the greater good of the people of Ireland and the whole of the British Isles.Ireland will always be tied to Britain, no matter what happens, and if it harms us it will harm them. He needs to change his attitude very urgently.Last night RAF legend John Nichol said: “Regardless of your views on Brexit, the notion that you can have a one way system is farcical and non sensical. It’s a ludicrous notion you can have a ban on civilian aircraft coming to one area but when you desperately need the Brits’ help you change your mind.“That would be strange and incomprehensible. “You really cannot have it both ways. We have spent years building up warm relations with Ireland. They should not be a republic of Brussels and think of their own long-term national interest. The EU will use them and spit them out, but we are genuinely Irelands best friend.Mr Varadka is playing a very dangerous game politically in trying to prevent Brexit.In a second rumpus, Mr Varadkar was also accused of hypocrisy after he claimed the EU had promised him that no physical checks will need to be erected on the Irish border even if the UK crashes out with no deal.Under the “doomsday scenario”, the Taoiseach said the “commitments of others” would then kick in to prevent a hard border. But Brexiteers leaped on his declaration to insist that has been Britian’s argument all along.Tory MEP Dan Hannan said: “Ireland confirms it won’t put up physical border checks in any circumstances, including a no-deal scenario. The UK has said the same from the outset. So what the hell are we arguing about?”Critics also said Mr Varadkar’s declaration was in contravention of the World Trade Organisation’s rules, which insist on borders between different customs regime being policed. Mrs May visited the Irish border town of Belleek in Fermanagh last night to meet local businesses and hear their concerns.This morning, the PM will deliver a speech in Belfast to call on hard Brexiteers who have rejected her softer Brexit Chequers deal to start addressing the reality on the ground. And she will insist that is their “duty”, as the future of the UK is at stake if they don’t.Mrs May will say: “Our job is not to deal with Brexit in theory, but to make a success of it in practice for all of our people. For all of us who care about our country, for all of us who want this Union of nations to thrive, that duty goes to the heart of what it means to be a United Kingdom and what it means to be a government.”But former Brexit minister David Jones challenged the PM to claim the Irish border issue has been “weaponised” by the EU to get its way in the negotiations.A record 1.13m flights operated in Irish airspace last year, according to the Irish Aviation Authority - 2.5 per cent more than in 2016.During 2017 there was a five per cent increase in the number of flights operating between Europe and the United States which used Irish airspace.They accounted for almost 501,000 of the total number of commercial flights handled in Irish airspace during 2017.Dublin to London is the second-busiest route in world.

Despite more sprouting up as the tournament went on, there’s been a noticeable difference.I think there is a reluctance to do so because shops may not want to feel they’re not being welcoming to members of the community, and perhaps Brexit has a part to play in that.Senior Labour figures have previously got in trouble for mocking the England flag.Emily Thornberry, one of Jeremy Corbyns closest allies, was forced to quit Ed Milibands Shadow Cabinet after posting a photo of a house in Rochester with St Georges flags flying outside."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000421745708-e1532098297350.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"caravan bluebird penthouse high bickington devon taw valley","story":"The gleaming cabin complete with kitchen, bath and a wine cellar is a far cry from the abandoned wreck Ralph Westmacott stumbled upon three years ago.After discovering it on his father-in-laws farm in Devon, the innovater decided to give the old Bluebird a new lease of life and spent 2,000 man hours and several thousand pounds on turning it into a quirky holiday home with a 1950s theme.He sourced a vintage green and white kitchenette and other period decor to transform it into a charming bolthole that takes guests back to the halcyon days of post-war Hi-de-Hi-style holidays.It comes with a double bed, a bathroom and central heating that is powered by a biomass boiler.The walls are painted white and green, and the floor has a checked pattern in the same two colours.Outside is a unique hot tub that is set in the chassis of an old Land Rover.The caravan, called the Bluebird Penthouse, is located on Ralphs father-in-laws farm at High Bickington in north Devon which has stunning views over the Taw Valley.The incredible transformation cost Ralph several thousand pounds but he is now recouping the investment as the caravan is fully booked for the rest of the summer at £130 a night.There is also a service fee of £49, which goes towards covering cleaning costs in preparation for the next guests.Ralph said he and his wife Lucy are delighted with how business is going, even if it means they cant stay in the caravan themselves.He said: The whole idea started when my father-in-law was talking about scrapping an old caravan that had been wasting away on his farm.I thought it seemed pretty cool and eventually managed to convince him to allow me to restore it.It was a lot of work and I lost count of how many hours I put into it somewhere around the 2,000 hour stage.The hot tub was similar really, it was an old farm Land Rover that had not been used for years and was just rusting away.With a bit of clever design we managed to use it as the foundation for a hot tub, which has turned out to be an incredibly popular feature.We consciously didnt do too much work to the exterior, because the ever so slightly tired look helps it to blend into the hillside.Its taken off hugely this year, just getting bigger and bigger and were all delighted with how its going."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict0002431013921.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"yellowstone park state emergency supervolcano erupt latest","story":"In this terrifying video, a huge, steam-spewing fissure is visible on a volcano in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, near inspiration point and hidden falls.Park officials have since closed off two areas of the park, citing concern for peoples safety.The National Park Service said that its possible the crack could have been caused by regular seismic activity, but they arent sure of the exact causes and have launched an investigation.Superintendent David Vela said: Human safety is our number one priority, and with an abundance of caution we are temporarily closing this area until we can properly asses the situation.Rangers have not confirmed when the areas with reopen, but they are currently completing a risk assessment.Grand Teton National Park is around seven miles away from Yellowstone National Park and the Yellowstone supervolcano.If both volcanoes were to erupt, it could cause a massive explosion capable of wiping of millions of people.Earlier this year and abnormal river of lava was found underneath the Yellowstone supervolcano - experts said if it were to erupt, the river could cause a mega eruption with the potential to wipe out western America.Last year a swarm of 1,400 mini earthquakes took place at the National Park, terrifying experts."},{"url":null,"title":"proud mum claims her baby spoke his first words at nine weeks","story":"She was stunned when she said “hiya” and “love you” to little Tommy-Frank and he repeated the words back.Sara, 29, said: “At first I thought I was going mad but he said it a few times.

Speaking earlier, Mrs May described her white paper proposals as \"a significant development of our position ... a coherent package\".She said: \"It is now for the EU to respond - not simply to fall back on to previous positions which have already been proven unworkable, but to evolve their position in kind.\"Addressing this call, Mr Barnier said the EU had already been \"creative and flexible\" on the backstop - and that the issue needed to be \"de-dramatised\".He said there could be no withdrawal agreement without a backstop, but suggested there was further room for manoeuvre from the EU side.\"It\u0027s not necessarily our backstop. We can work on this, amend it, improve our backstop - the one that the Commission proposed on behalf of the Union.\"Technically we feel that it\u0027s workable, we can improve it further, we can work on it.

I was thoroughly impressed by her style and perseverance.She swam the longest Channel crossing at 28 hours and 44 minutes when she was 56 years old, and in my view, the person who swims slowest is the greatest as they need the most grit and are immersed in the cold for longest.After the swim we transferred from the Aquila to the Princess speed boat to rush to Plymouth for the lord mayor\u0027s tea reception to welcome me home.The sea state was slight to moderate, but combined with a force-three wind, there was kitchen cutlery and crockery flying everywhere and several people on the verge of being seasick over the side.The nasty chop in the sea meant the transfer nearly ended with several crew members overboard, with many wet feet and a couple of green faces.We are now all safely aboard the Princess and are speeding home to Plymouth ready for an afternoon of celebration.Aquila is sailing behind us and will take several hours to reach harbour. Me and the crew will be using the Princess for the next few days to continue swimming, as it is much faster.:: Day eight - 5.1 miles (8.3km)Especially large jellyfish were out on force this morning, with two new species spotted that looked particularly nasty.Another first for today was a shark sighting! We are unsure of the species, but the crew saw its fin pointing out the water about 30m from the starboard side (luckily opposite to me).Thankfully, it didn\u0027t seem to spot or be interested in me so we kept going and the crew only told me once I was out.I have developed a cold so the morning\u0027s swim was tough going. I am resting as much as I can now before the weekend, which sees me and the crew attending events in my hometown of Plymouth, so we have a jam-packed schedule.On our way back for our last day in Falmouth now.:: Day seven - 5.75 miles (9.26km)I was joined by my first guest swimmer today!Chris Coleman, who is deputy head of Taunton School, is a Channel relay swimmer and has championed open water swimming with his pupils.We are hoping some of the pupils might join us further into the journey.There was another sunfish sighting today, while some dolphins came right up to our boat\u0027s hull.For now, we are continuing with a strategy of one swim a day.:: Day six - 5.3 miles (8.5km)The morning swim today was great.I smashed out 5.3 miles (8.5km) and the plan is for this to be the only swim of the day.There were no wildlife spots this morning and only a very small number of jellyfish, but there were lots of fishing boats out that I had to navigate around.We are now motoring on towards Falmouth for a bit of a recovery day after all the excitement of meeting Prince Charles on Monday.:: Day five - 6.6 miles (10.6km)Met Prince Charles today - in my shorts and flip flops.I was a keynote speaker at the Ocean Plastics Solutions Day at St Agnes in Cornwall, organised by Surfers Against Sewage.The Prince of Wales listened attentively as I explained what we were doing, and why it is important to make sure the oceans are as clean as they can be, as we battle problems like single use plastics. Not ideal conditions today - there were lots of jellfyfish blooms and rain squalls along the way.Yesterday\u0027s final swim was a disappointment. We picked the wrong current to follow around the last section of The Lizard - the most southerly point in Great Britain - so after one hour and 20 minutes of hard graft, I\u0027d made virtually no progress.After the poor swim, we anchored out at sea so we could catch an early tide this morning. However, we finally found success! Our craft\u0027s skipper, Stephen Praetorius, and I managed to locate the missing offshore current, which meant I could fly 3.4 miles (5.5km) in one hour and 20 minutes.We are now back on track and we are definitely one happy crew again. My support vessel Aquila has travelled to Falmouth for much needed water and supplies. We are now down to our emergency water rations.I went out again this evening and swam straight into a good current, swimming 3.2 miles (5.1km).A pod of four dolphins including two young ones joined me for a few minutes, and were only metres away.I could hear their clicking under the surface.:: Day four - 4 miles (6.5km)Today was a crucial day for the first week of The Long Swim.I rounded Lizard Point, the most southerly point in Great Britain and a place renowned for its treacherous waters.Although things appeared calm on the surface, they were rather more turbulent underneath.Whirlpools and eddies caused an up-swelling of cold water. The temperature when the swim began was 16C (61F), and when I came out of the water after 79 minutes it had dropped to 12C (54F).Although our images show me swimming straight towards the rocks, the tide was actually perpendicular, pushing me 90 degrees sideways.Big up to skipper Stephen Praetorius, who navigated our craft and me safely through on the morning spring tide.I have never experienced such strong currents. It was like swimming in a flooding river.This evening swim then started well - we saw pods of dolphins and a sunfish - but after that it didn\u0027t go to plan. I started swimming on the wrong current, which made me swim even slower than I would have done if there\u0027d been no current at all.After struggling against counter-eddies for nearly an hour and a half I had covered only a couple of kms.I made the call to stop and try again first thing in the morning - a move we had not planned. This means we couldn\u0027t motor to Falmouth for the evening to replace our water, power and get food. We have now run out of water and are on our emergency supply bottles, having anchored in the small village of Coverack.The plan for tomorrow is to do a swim early to make up for the lost time.:: Day three - 9 miles (14.5km)Glassy sea on a beautiful Saturday in Mounts Bay, with a perfect spring tide current, which helped propel me toward Lizard Point.The crew continued fine-tuning the jellyfish watch and are now on a rota. It is difficult to keep focus after 20 minutes and very easy to be hypnotised by the motion of the sea and you glaze over in the glare. I have an active mind while swimming and I like to keep track of my thoughts. Occasionally I stop to shout a word or phrase for the crew to write down - something to trigger my memory later.The stream of consciousness can get quite interesting!Today was the first time we have encountered big ships - there was a row of three oil tankers anchored on the eastern end of the bay. Now heading back to Mullion Cove again, we will be heading back out in the late afternoon to pick up the GPS point for the evening swim.Overall, a phenomenal morning swim and it feels as though we are banking kilometres. All happy on board. I am back in the water this evening and hopefully this will take us to the edge of Lizard Point.This evening was all about the Lizard. Do we shoot it tonight, making the best that the spring tide can give, or do we take a measured approach and leave it for the morning?Today\u0027s swim was shorter, but fast, sometimes I was swimming at over four knots - that\u0027s 7.2 kph.Overall another happy day, as we say goodbye to Mounts Bay.:: Day two - 8 miles (12.8km) Another two good sessions in the morning and evening, in very fair conditions. I will be doing two swims a day and slingshotting around Land\u0027s End.I had a few periods of jellyfish activity - the biggest we saw was longer than our shortest crew member.I was stung on my arms, which we treated with vinegar after I got out of the water - it made me smell of fish and chips!We ended up setting up a jellyfish watch, with spotters armed with whistles.:: Day one - 6 miles (9.8km) Today was a day of ironing out the swim procedures. This involved working out communication between me in the water and my team, adhering to the verification protocols, working out actual distance covered versus distance swum - it\u0027s difficult to swim in an exact straight line.In total I manage to cover 6 miles (9.8km) of my journey, although this is less than the actual distance I swam.This was the first day when all nine members of the campaign were on board, and over the next few days we will learn much about the teamwork and processes that will help us get through the entire expedition.Another first today was my first jellyfish sting. It got me right on the crotch.We ended the day by sitting at anchorage just off Mousehole, finishing up dinner and getting in an early sleep before we move back to the GPS point at 4.30 am for the next swim at 6.00am. :: The eve of the swimYou are either a pioneer or a follower you can\u0027t be both. And if you are a pioneer, you know all about worry.If something has been done before, you know it\u0027s possible. If you don\u0027t know something is possible, you worry about it.I\u0027m about to embark on a swim with significant risks and consequences - financial, reputational and environmental. So there hasn\u0027t been a night in the last month that I haven\u0027t woken up.A few nights ago I was using the worry hours to plan, and remembered something Mike Tyson once said: \"Everyone\u0027s got a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\" I have a plan to try and swim 10km per day. But when I swim into my first bloom of jellyfish, that plan will become flexible.I know that I\u0027m going to get sunburnt. I\u0027m going to be frozen, I\u0027m going to be stung, and I\u0027m going to become mentally and physically exhausted. Have I done too much preparation, or not enough?What if we get the tides wrong, get caught in a counter eddy and find ourselves going backwards? This is a notoriously dangerous coastline, with the shipwrecks to prove it.Did I mention that half my expedition team is new, and half has no sailing experience?In those waking worry hours I also remembered the Stockdale paradox. Admiral Stockdale was an American pilot who was shot down in Vietnam and spent eight years in a POW camp. He said that the people who survived had two important qualities.First, they always believed they would be freed. Second - and this is the paradox - they had no optimism. Because the people who did have optimism - the people who hoped they would be free by Easter, then by Thanksgiving, then by Christmas, and had those hopes dashed over and over again - those people didn\u0027t survive. The people who survived were the ones who confronted the brutal reality of their situation.I have to face some brutal facts when I look at the chart of our 560km swim route. This is the longest swim anyone has ever done, adhering to Channel Rules in water this low temperature. I honestly don\u0027t know how I\u0027m going to do this. But I do believe I\u0027ll see the white cliffs of Dover. So that\u0027s the paradox that\u0027s going through my mind.The swimming is only part of the challenge. We\u0027ve also had to co-ordinate with sponsors, raise funds for the expedition, recruit the right people for the team, and deal with the media... all the while juggling private lives with unexpected domestic crises. As if all that wasn\u0027t enough, after six months of campaign planning and preparation, we learned that Donald Trump is coming to London on the day I start swimming. We certainly hadn\u0027t planned on such a big media story distracting from our message.Because the message is the reason I am doing this swim. The truth is we are failing our oceans. And it\u0027s only through bold and courageous action that we\u0027re going to be able to protect them properly. \"Piecemeal\" protection is not going to safeguard our seas. We need an enormous shift in business and government and the public to be able to do this.There are challenges ahead. But as English Channel crossing pioneer Captain Webb said, nothing great is ever easy.I\u0027ll keep that in mind as I strike out for Dover."},{"url":null,"title":"brave british nuclear veterans win","story":"NewsBrave British nuclear veterans win amazing victory as government FINALLY promises investigation and considers medalsDefence Secretary Gavin Williamson agreed to acknowledge the \"exceptional circumstances\" of the afflicted soldiers whose relatives have inherited health defects caused by bomb trials\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsBySusie Boniface20:04, 20 JUL 2018NewsThere has been a major step forward in the campaign for recognition of nuclear was veterans (Image: Tim Anderson/Daily Mirror)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBritain\u0027s Cold War heroes have won an amazing victory in their fight for justice over nuclear testing. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has promised campaigners: “It is time to take a fresh look at this.” He revealed at a meeting in Whitehall he has ordered a committee to consider medal recognition based on the “exceptional circumstances” of the veterans. And in the wake of a powerful Mirror crusade he has also ordered a study into the shocking ill health suffered from experiments. Mr Williamson met Alan Owen, of the British Nuclear Test Veterans Association, Shirley Denson, widow of RAF pilot Eric, and Tory MP John Hayes.  The minister said: “We must never forget the work of our test veterans.” Shirley, 84, said: “You could hear a pin drop as I revealed 37% of Eric’s descendants have a birth defect.” “I told him about my great-grandson Jamie, who is on his third set of adult teeth, and my great-granddaughter Ella who has an extra tube to her kidney. “In all, 37% of Eric’s descendants have a birth defect of some kind. Mr Owen said: “I told him that our members have spent decades with a growing belief they have been irradiated, and report suicides, marriage breakdown and mental illness.  “They have been fighting an invisible enemy for decades, and they’ve had to fight the MoD too. I asked him to take personal control of the issue. Some 22,000 personnel, many on National Service, served at bomb test sites from 1952 to 1967 in the South Pacific. Today just 1,500 are thought to survive, and they have an estimated 155,000 descendants with 10 times the usual number of birth defects. Studies showed that a third of the veterans died before 1999 and their children were five times more likely to die as infants. Details of the new research into the veterans\u0027 health defects are yet to be confirmed. The concession comes just 56 days after The Mirror launched a campaign for a medal, which has gained cross-party support from Jeremy Corbyn and Tom Watson of the Labour Party as well as a promise to consider it by the Prime Minister Theresa May. Alan Owen, chairman of the British Nuclear Tests Veterans Association, said: “I told him the veterans did their duty, and said ‘now it is time for you to do yours’. We hoped for progress on the medal, but the new study is a superb bonus, beyond our expectations.  And Tory MP John Hayes, who is patron of the BNTVA and secured the meeting, added: “I am delighted he has responded so quickly and positively. He was clear that it\u0027s not in his power to just award a medal, but equally clear that he appreciates our argument, respects our campaign and will advance our case to the people who can. The new study was a step further than we expected. It shows how the Secretary of State really cares about the brave veterans who did so much for Britain. I will fight with them and for them, because they deserve nothing less. Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson, who first called in Parliament for a medal, said: I warmly welcome the decision to refer the campaign to the Government medals committee. But this mustn\u0027t be kicked into the long grass.

Every week, there will be a detailed bundle of advice published for citizens, consumers and companies about what they need to do to prepare for March 29, 2019, when Britain will cease to be a member of the EU and be flicked, like an unwanted beer mat, off Beachy Head into the arms of all those international trade deals we don\u0027t have.  We can only hope a civil servant has had the sense to write \u0027DON\u0027T PANIC!\u0027 on the cover. Of course they won\u0027t be necessary if the EU gives in and does what Jacob Rees-Mogg wants. And if they don\u0027t, there\u0027s a strong chance they\u0027ll just extend the Article 50 deadline, which would be useful if the headbangers hadn\u0027t insisted on legislation that named March 29 as B-Day. So what will they say, these worst-case-scenario papers that have suddenly become, with eight months to go, the increasingly-likely-scenario plan?  Even the most cautious types could tell you it\u0027ll mean a \u0026pound5.50 driving permit at Dover, a shortage of cucumbers and longer queues at airports. But the full truth is, in a post-Brexpocalypse world, it\u0027ll involve a lot of currently-unforeseen consequences of having made the EU an offer it can very easily refuse.  Dark and unpleasant things like this: 1. Cliff Richard will lose his human rights   Which will be annoying, as he\u0027s just spent around \u0026pound4million trying to improve them for people accused of terrible things. If we Brexit without copying the EU\u0027s Charter of Fundamental Rights, we\u0027ll lose rules on data protection, human trafficking, disability rights, equal pay and workplace discrimination, as well as the rights of victims of crime.  We\u0027ll still have the European Court of Human Rights, which is not part of the EU, but it\u0027ll take a six-figure sum and several years to take any complaints to it, so unless you\u0027re as rich as Cliff the chances are the ECHR will be as much use as a unicorn\u0027s nosebag. The government says all current laws we have as a result of the EU will remain in UK law - however, there\u0027s nothing to stop any future Parliament repealing them in the name of, say, trade deals with tyrants. 2. All medicine will be 30-year-old cough syrup from the back of the medicine cabinet   Goodbye, radioactive isotopes used in MRI scanners. So long, EU-regulated cancer medication, clinical trials and any confidence you currently have that a packet of paracetamol from the garage definitely does not include Spice. Hello again to whatever you can find in an exploration of the furthest reaches of your bathroom storage. Need opioids because mum broke her arm? Tixylix. Need an appendix removed? Vicks Vapour Rub, if you can get the lid off. And in the case of childbirth, you can forget a nurse, midwife or doctor and place your faith instead in the pain-killing, life-saving properties of a dusty packet of Strepsils.  You can say Oh, lime cordial! Delicious! all you please, but it has already been announced that from March next year and in the absence of a deal the UK authorities will no longer be able to engage with the EU medicine regulator.  May I suggest you start stockpiling Germolene. You are going to need it. 3. Kent will fill up with lorries and empty of people   Perhaps you don\u0027t live in Kent and couldn\u0027t care less. But 1,554,600 people do, and when the most rebellious county in Britain (a regicide, two peasant revolts, a saint who told a king to bog off and the woman who sparked schism in the church, and you\u0027re welcome) realises it has become a lorry park for an entire national motorway network they will up sticks and cross the Medway in droves.  Still not bothered? Ask yourselves this. Would 1.5m brown people suddenly arriving on the mainland be able to find a home, job and schools, and does the fact the Kentish ones are a mix of brown, white, chavvy, privileged, light-fingered and small-minded really make much difference to the answer? They\u0027re not all Pop Larkin, you know. And Catherine Zeta Jones was Welsh. 4. The end of the rule of law   WAIT WHAT.  Sorry, but yes. It\u0027s already begun. Law in this country is built upon convention and precedent, and in the past two years the convention that the Prime Minister is in charge of things has been tossed out of the window while precedent has been offered up like a sacrificial chicken on the altar of The People Voted For A Thing There Is No Precedent For.   We are now in a situation where thousands march because a Far Right idiot who admitted breaking the law, and imperilled the course of justice for everyone, is in in jail for it. We live in a land where seagulls are murdered for chips, children leave the house tooled up and we are perhaps 5 minutes away from someone claiming that the freedom to commit sexual assault is a human right.  When this all goes tits up next year the chances are your home will become your castle. Check the locks, barricade the windows, figure out your escape routes. If you\u0027ve got a garden, dig a bunker, and if you\u0027re near water build an ark. Once financial passporting is no longer allowed, and the City collapses, the countryside will be filled with currency and commodity traders roaming wild in their pink trousers, gorging on the proletariat while Jacob Rees-Mogg shepherds them along in an armoured Bentley with a Remainer stuck in the grille.   And perhaps you think this is all so much Remoaner panic, except for two things. Firstly, the government is about to drip-feed you a weekly diet of very similar, if worded differently, predictions. And secondly there are reports that Vladimir Putin has given a Far Right paramilitary motorbike gang in Slovakia some of his tanks. The Night Wolves paramilitaries and their friends say these are merely decommissioned vehicles hired for a new museum. But these guys are said to admire Stalin and fought on the pro-Russian side in Ukraine, where the US says they attacked the country\u0027s navy HQ.  Ukraine, incidentally, is the same place where Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was downed by a Russian missile in 2014, which Putin\u0027s militia claimed credit for until they realised it was not a military transport but a holiday flight with 298 civilians on board.  So that\u0027s pro-Russian paramilitaries with Russian military kit inside the EU borders, but it\u0027s just for a museum honest even though they have a history of it actually being for killing.  As we head down the Brexit plughole there may yet be a last-minute rescue by way of an extension, a general election, or a people\u0027s vote. But the portents are bad - Mogg is no longer funny and there are sharks everywhere.  There is however one bright, shining light on the horizon, and that is if civilised society collapses it will be acceptable and indeed vital for the nation\u0027s recovery for a crew of plucky survivors to pull together, hunt down Boris Johnson, shave his head and dip him repeatedly in the nearest rancid pile of uncollected domestic refuse while telling him they will stop just as soon as he produces a Brexit dividend.  Which is something to look forward to. Pity the electricity will have been off for months by that point and no-one will be able to livetweet it, but beggars can\u0027t be choosers. As we are all about to find out.

Mrs May was greeted at the Crescent Arts Centre on Friday morning by around a 100 protesters ahead of a breakfast meeting with the Belfast Youth Forum.  And once inside, she had to defend her confidence and supply arrangement with the DUP , a pact struck when the Tories were left with no overall majority after the 2017 general election.  John Joe O\u0027Grady told Mrs May: I think your coalition with the DUP infringes people\u0027s rights here. Mrs May replied: In the UK government, we work for and represent all communities.   What we\u0027ve put forward in terms of Brexit is something that works for all communities in Northern Ireland.  Nevan Mawhinney then replied: But the DUP aren\u0027t, the DUP aren\u0027t working for all communities. You getting into bed with the DUP has a detrimental effect on us. Mrs May noted that the issues the young people raised were covered by devolved powers, but was reminded by the group that Northern Ireland has not had its own assembly in 18 months. The protest outside the centre was made up of people from different groups fighting what they called state injustices.  Child abuse victims, families of those killed during the Northern Ireland conflict and LGBT rights campaigners were among those gathered with placards and signs.  Seamus Finucane, brother of murdered human rights solicitor Pat Finucane, said: I\u0027ve probably been campaigning for truth and justice for longer than Theresa May has had a career in politics. We are here today to call for a full implementation of the Stormont House agreement and all its mechanisms, to allow closure for all the families who have suffered through the conflict, for all victims.

Labour accused Government of “penalising ill people” by failing to inform them of entitlement after moving to the all-in-one benefit. Helen Goodman blasted the Department for Work and Pens\u0026shyions and called on Employment Minister Alok Sharma for refunds. Fines can be as high as \u0026pound100 per prescription. The MP said: “This is the minister’s fault. “They should not penalise ill people because of their shambolic rollout of Universal Credit.”  Not all claimants qualify for free prescriptions and eligibility can change based on how much they earned in a given assessment period. But there is no automatic system to tell them whether they qualify. Even ticking the wrong box on the form can lead to a fine. Just 35,000 people were penalised in 2014, the early stages of the delayed credit rollout.

If only we’d all take the time out to look at them, says Sir David Attenborough. The veteran broadcaster is backing the Big Butterfly Count, which launched on Friday and urges us all to spend the next three weeks recording the butterflies we spy in our gardens and further afield. Organised by Butterfly Conservation and sponsored by B\u0026ampQ, the count asks us all to record 17 species of common butterflies and two day-flying moths, not only to safeguard our own mental health, but to help protect the species in the future.   You can sign up here . But first, to help you take flight, here are ten common – and rarer – butterflies to watch out for.  Common British butterflies  Brimstone      The male is the only large, lemon-yellow butterfly in the UK, the female is cream-coloured. Less likely to see them in Scotland and N.Ireland.  The Speckled Wood      With dark brown wings speckled with cream dots, they have spread to East Anglia, the Midlands and the North in recent years due to climate change.  The Comma      Looking almost ragged, its orange and brown wings are heavily scalloped. When its wings are shut you’ll see a silvery comma shape on the underside.

It took a team of 20 scientists, nutritionists and chocolatiers almost two years to create. And Cadbury\u0027s has assured the bar will still have the \u0027much-loved taste\u0027. However it will contain less sugar with no artificial sweeteners, colours or preservatives and no increase in calories. The new bar, which will sit alongside the standard bar on shelves, will go on sale from 2019. The brand hopes to show that it is playing its role in tackling obesity, including childhood obesity, in the UK. If successful Mondelēz International - the company which owns Cadbury\u0027s - will also look to apply to give other Dairy Milk products the same treatment.  Over the next two years a new Cadbury Boost+ Protein, which will contain 12g of protein per bar and 32 per cent less sugar, is being introudced. As well as 30 per cent less sugar variants of Maynards Bassetts hero products - Wine Gums and Jelly Babies - and a 40 per cent less sugar line extension on BelVita. “Our brands have been around for hundreds of years, said Glenn Caton from Mondelēz International. They are a part of British culture and heritage and play a special role in people’s lives as treats to be enjoyed during a moment of indulgence. We are working hard to remind people of this to help them make informed choices by providing clear nutritional information and labelling, as well providing more choice by expanding our portion control offerings and improving the nutritional profile of our brands.

Disturbing images show the boiling husky collapsed on the ground after being freed from the sweltering car as temperatures reached 29 degrees outside yesterday. Incredibly when the dog\u0027s owners returned they couldn\u0027t see what they had done wrong, a witness claimed. A parking ticket on the car led those who discovered the distressed dog to believe that it had been there for around two hours. Temperatures inside a locked car can soar to almost double in a matter of hours, and can be lethal to dogs .  Samantha Claire Hardwidge stumbled upon the boiling husky in Swindon, Wiltshire, with a fellow colleague and shared the pictures online yesterday.  Taking to Facebook , Samatha wrote: Shout out to the owners of this car who felt it appropriate to leave their husky in their car.  The parking ticket shows them arriving at 10:47am. The dog was found by me and my colleague in a poor state at 12:35pm - with the parking ticket showing they could park until 1:46pm.  The police were called and removed the dog from the car. The owners arrived back at the car and proceeded to shout and swear that they didn\u0027t see what the problem is. The owners refused to take the dog to the vets to be checked despite it being visibly distressed from being in the car for so long. The owners refused to pass their details to the police. The dog was seized so it could be checked by a vet. The photographs show the distressed husky inside the car, and later lying on the ground on it\u0027s side with a water bowl beside it.  The post has received more than 15,000 shares and nearly 5000 comments from furious social media users. Kay Sell said: Disgusting, the owners should be locked in the car for several hours and then go to jail if they are still alive. Susan Barker said: Bad enough to lock any creature in a car with this heat, let alone a husky type with their thick underfur. Morons. Ted Davis added: Stupid is not what I would say, so cruel. Bloody idiots. While Valerie Lorne said simply: Disgusting behaviour. Speaking to a local paper, a spokeswoman from Wiltshire Police said yesterday: When we arrived the dog was heavily panting and not responding. The window was slightly open but the dog was obviously in distress.

Kayleigh Snaith, now 16, has faced cruel comments from strangers and classmates telling her she’s ruined her life, would never achieve at school and even branding her ‘disgusting’. However with the unfailing encouragement from her parents and the added motivation of providing a good life for her little girl, Kayleigh has raised a happy, healthy tot and completed seven GCSEs. And Kayleigh, who is due to study music at college from September, couldn’t imagine a better way to celebrate finishing school than getting glammed up with her daughter. While the toddler couldn’t attend the party with her mum, Kayleigh bought Harley a gorgeous white lace dress and the adorable pair posed for photos before driving to prom together on July 3.  Kayleigh, who lives with her parents in Stanley, Co Durham, said: “I wanted to take Harley to my prom and get her all dressed up to show her that she is a princess in my eyes – and always will be. “I hope she grows up knowing that she deserves the best and never to settle for anything or anyone that makes her unhappy. She should be treated with love and care. “I also wanted to show everyone else who thought I would never make it through school being a young mum that I did it. Here I am celebrating finishing school with my daughter. “I wanted everyone to see that Harley comes first. Nothing is just about me anymore, it’s about me and Harley. I wanted her to feel as beautiful and loved as I did on my prom day. Kayleigh kept her pregnancy secret for six months as she was terrified how her parents Sharon Snaith, 48, and Tommy Snaith, 53, would react. But the schoolgirl’s stunned mum and dad promised to support Kayleigh no matter what and set about frantically preparing their house for their new granddaughter Harley Snaith.  The young mum admitted it hasn’t been easy. She said: When Harley was a newborn I would be up through the night with her, sometimes for two or three hours if she didn’t settle, and then I would go to school. “At home I’m a mother and an adult to my child but then in school I was suddenly a student, a child there to learn. “I was so tired all the time and I would have people telling me I was disgusting, that I’d ruined my life, I’d never be a good mum and I’d never achieve anything in life. It was really hard. “But knowing Harley was at home waiting for me and that I was working for our future really motivated me. All the tiredness was worth it to build the best possible life for my daughter. Kayleigh said that getting through GCSEs was tough. She admitted she was terrified that she wouldn’t be able to do them while raising Harley.  “I remember sitting and crying because I was worried I would fail and I wouldn’t be able to get a job and do the best I could for Harley she told. It was a lot of pressure. “But Harley inspired me to keep going and gave me the big push I needed. I\u0027ve worked really hard and I’m looking forward to getting my results in August. “I hope by sharing the pictures from my prom, other young mums and their parents will realise that having a baby in your teens isn’t the end of the world. “No matter what people tell you or think of you, if you push yourself and work hard you can still achieve all of your life goals. “Yes, it is a struggle and it’s life changing but being a new mum always is. There are mums in their twenties and thirties who find it scary. Your age doesn’t define whether or not you’re a good mum. “You learn to ignore the comments. Harley is a beautiful, cheeky and happy little girl. She is a ray of sunshine and I’m proud to be her mum. I’ll never regret having her or be ashamed.”  When she skipped her period and started feeling movement in her stomach, Kayleigh knew she was pregnant but struggled to share the news with her family. After many sleepless nights scared about what a baby might mean for her future, Kayleigh spoke to her head of year who called in her mum. During her pregnancy, the mum-of-one attended school part time and returned full time just four weeks after Harley was born on May 6, 2016, weighing 6lbs 13oz. Kayleigh admits that raising a baby and finishing school has been difficult and says she couldn’t have done it without the incredible support and parenting tips from her mum and dad. While it has been tough, Kayleigh says Harley has made her a better and happier person and hopes sharing her experience will make society more accepting of young mums.  Kayleigh said: “As soon as I missed my period I suspected I was pregnant but I told myself that it happens to some girls. “When I started feeling movement in my stomach it was obvious what was going on but I was terrified of telling my mum and dad. “All these things go through your head. I was worried they would kick me out or make me get rid of her. I spent so many nights awake worrying about it, I couldn’t focus on anything else. “When I started to get a bit of a bump I knew I couldn’t keep it secret anymore so I asked my head of year to call in my mum. I couldn’t stop crying when I told her, I was so scared. “My mum was really shocked but I remember her saying ‘if you want to keep this child, we will support you and do everything we can for you’. “She even offered to adopt the baby but I wanted to raise her. My dad was a bit more upset, it took him longer to adjust. I’m his little girl and it was hard for him. “But they have both been amazing, they’re so supportive. They got everything ready for Harley’s arrival in three months. It was manic but we just about scraped through. “They’re always trying to better me as a parent and give me really great advice. I am so lucky, I couldn’t have got through all of this without them.

Jean Astley was presented with the realistic-looking birthday cake at her party on Saturday, as her granddaughter Haley Goulty, 40, filmed. Hilarious video footage shows Jean gazing in disbelief at her phallic surprise as daughter Liz Ferrar, 59, places it in front of her to the delight of her watching family. Liz urges her elderly mum to ‘come on, play with it’ - before squeezing double cream at her through a strategically placed pipe in the cake. As her family cheer, Jean squeals in shock as her hand is soaked in the surprise white liquid, before bursting into laughter.   Harrowing 999 call as girl, 15, watched stepdad pour petrol over home and threatened to burn sleeping family ALIVE  But the birthday girl got the willies and hilariously gave the cake a good shove away from herself - all while laughing her head off. Haley, from Leicester, said: “My nan wasn’t expecting it at all. You could see the shock in her face. “She may be 90 but she’s still young at heart. For a 90-year-old she’s got a very good sense of humour, and she swears like a trooper. “My mum had the cake made for her. I’ve no idea what inspired my mum to get that cake. “Everyone is used to my nan sitting in her arm chair, fag in one hand, remote in the other hand, and I think she really wanted to get her a cake like that but couldn’t get one. “But you can’t top that one now. She absolutely loved the cake. “When she was waiting for a cake she knew we had a surprise, and she just went ‘ooh is it a male stripper?’ “Me and my husband were joking a few months back about getting her one and she was saying ‘oh, maybe 10 years ago’. “We were going to have it sent to the house rather than the party, but I think that’s what she was expecting because we were covering her up in paper towels. “Nobody knew, only my mum and my brother, and it was all quiet and then they bought the cake out. It was brilliant.   Hero workmen save three-year-old boy who fell 40ft out of apartment window with amazing catch  “It’s lovely to see her like that because she doesn’t really get out much anymore.” The birthday party bought in five generations of family, with Jean’s 12 children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and even great-great grandchildren making up nearly 200 guests. But it wasn’t the first time that the family had managed to prank their matriarch with a raunchy gift. Haley said: “A few years ago my uncle bought her a vibrator and she thought it was a back massager. She didn’t use it. “We told her what it was and she just said: ‘put that thing away’. She has a great sense of humour in every aspect. “She’s very, very comical. We like to shock her if we can. “But she’s very quick off the mark. Say something and she can come back on you dead quick. “Honestly, people are really surprised when they meet her. “When someone new comes into the family we never tell them what my nan’s like so we can spring her on them.

The two duchesses were watching the Ladies\u0027 final from centre court in the royal box (where else?) and seemed to get on like a house on fire. But before Kate and Meghan there was Fergie and Diana - the original \u0027Merry Wives of Windsor\u0027. Both young twenty-something women when they were hurled into royal life - and the limelight - the Duchess of York and the Princess of Wales had a clear rapport in the early years of their marriages. They even holidayed together and were infamously pictured at Ascot poking Fergie\u0027s schoolfriend Lulu in the bottom with their umbrellas.  Fergie has frequently described Diana as her best friend and has often spoken of her devastation at her tragic death, made all the more painful as the two were not on speaking on terms at the time. The Duchess of York never got to reconcile with her friend. Their fall-out was touched on in Fergie\u0027s tell-all book, Finding Sarah.  Diana was one of the quickest wits I knew nobody made me laugh like she did, she wrote. We took vacations together with our children. Sadly, at the end [of the Princess’s life] we hadn\u0027t spoken for a year, although I never knew the reason, except that once Diana got something in her head it stuck there for a while. However, the reason is believed to be very well known, the Mail Online reports.

Members of the public watching Meghan\u0027s transformation from Hollywood actress into the Duchess of Sussex could be forgiven for thinking she\u0027d taken to her new role with ease. She made an effortless joint engagement with the Queen to open a new bridge, attended the RAF centenary flypast, was a guest of the Irish President alongside Harry, joined sister-in-law Kate Middleton at Wimbledon and looked stunning at Prince Louis\u0027 christening. But she is reportedly confused about aspects of royal life and the old-fashioned ways of the Windsor household. A source told People how Meghan has found certain rules in the royal household difficult to understand, like the fact that the Queen prefers women in dresses or skirts rather than trouser suits, and is often asking Harry why things have to be done in a certain way.    The source added: I think she finds it a little frustrating at times, but this is her new life, and she has to deal with it.” The monarchy website includes a reference to Meghan as a feminist.   She had never previously shied away from voicing her opinions on issues that were close to her heart. But protocol prohibits royal family members from expressing political opinions. There was no greater example of this than an Irish politician\u0027s recent blunder which revealed Meghan\u0027s opinions on the country\u0027s recent referendum on legalising abortion .  Senator Catherine Noone posted on Facebook : A pleasure to meet Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex at the British Ambassador\u0027s Residence this evening. The Duchess and I had a chat about the recent referendum result - she watched with interest and was pleased to see the result. The comments suggest that Meghan may have broken royal protocol by expressing political opinon. Since the 17th century, members of the British monarchy have been banned from doing just that, which includes voting.

Enough is enough. If our father dies, it\u0027s on you Meg.  Since Meghan, 36, and Prince Harry married in May, Samantha has blasted her sister and the couple\u0027s relationship on a number of occasions. She has accused Meghan of ignoring her own family while paying tribute to others. Samantha said: Glad you have so much time to gallivant around playing tribute to others while ignoring your own father. How cold can you be and look in the mirror. Harry? I guess I was right.

In a post on Facebook after the incident, furious Victoria wrote: “My daughter Seren is not dead, she has not killed herself.  “This is the kind of thing some kids will do these days to others, make up a vile Snapchat post saying that someone has killed themselves. “How insensitive, how horrendous, how hurtful to both my daughter and to me and her father. “I know that my daughter Seren would never ever do this to someone else as she knows right from wrong and has compassion for the feelings of others. “Luckily I’ve done a good job in forming her personality and I’ve given her coping skills to help her deal with the actions of lesser people she will unfortunately come across.  “Check up on what your children are faced with on social media. “Some kids won’t tell their parents like Seren does.

Laura Harris, 43, sparked outrage across Britain when she was told a medicine she needed wasn\u0027t available from her own employer. The mum-of-two from of Barnstaple, Devon, was diagnosed with terminal bowel cancer and set up a fundraising page aimed at raising \u0026pound21,000 for the drug Bevacizumab that could extend her life. She was denied the drug from her employers after the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) said in 2010 it would not be funded by the NHS because the benefits did not justify the costs. Thousands of strangers from across the world have now donated a total of nearly \u0026pound100,000 - enough for almost five blocks of the treatment. Laura has now taken three cycles of Bevacizumab alongside a new chemo drug and said her latest scan delivered her results she could only dream of. It showed no evidence of active disease - which she described as a type of remission.  Breaking the news to her followers and supporters on Facebook she wrote: I have some great news to share for all of you who shared or donated to my Go Fund Me so that I could buy chemotherapy for myself. I had a scan while in hospital and there is No Evidence of Active Disease in me anywhere. I\u0027m staying on this life extending treatment as long as possible. Thank you for saving my life. Laura said the results were more than she could ever have hoped for. She added: My cancer deposits have all shrunk down and been rendered inactive by my current treatment regime which I raised money for. This means none of my cancer is active or growing right now. My oncologist said about my recent CT scan results that \u0027my lungs look as if they\u0027ve never had cancer in them.\u0027 My family and I are understandably over the moon with these results. It shows the world that stage 4 cancer doesn\u0027t have to be an automatic death sentence.  Laura, mum to Molly, 14, and Noah, 16, and step-mum to Zach, eight, has been battling stage four bowel cancer since last year. But she astounded colleagues by returning to her work caring for fellow cancer patients at North District Hospital later that year. Laura came to the UK 20 years ago from America before qualifying as an oncology nurse in 2006.  Each block of the treatment costs \u0026pound21,000 and Laura initially hoped to raise enough for two. But after her story was publicised the donations came flooding in. Laura, who has now completed three cycles of the treatment, said they were keeping the GoFundMe page open to fund as many of them as possible.  She said: Of course the success of the treatment means I will continue on it as long as it continues to work. Thus we have left our fundraising page open for any who would want to donate towards my future treatment. These results are far beyond any we could have imagined. We were absolutely blown away. Due to the side effects of the chemo I was in hospital fighting an infection at the time they gave me the results. I was actually expecting bad news as I was feeling so unwell. It certainly perked me up to get such amazing results. The response we have had from my community and the world has truly been overwhelming. Never in a million years did we think we would get the support we have been given and continue to receive. My greatest wish, above all my bucket list items, is to reach the masses with my message.

The Prince of Wales has recreated the look and feel of his home for the centrepiece exhibition of the summer opening of Buckingham Palace. Charles selected more than 100 pieces from private family paintings and photographs, major art from the Royal Collection and work by up-and-coming artists for the attraction, which marks his 70th birthday year. Personal touches in the exhibition include poignant family photographs, from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s recent wedding, Prince George\u0027s official christening image and a picture of Charles holding his first grandchild with the Duke of Cambridge beside him.  One of the highlights of Prince \u0026amp Patron is Napoleon Bonaparte\u0027s red felt hooded cloak, a stunning artefact the heir to the throne knows well from Windsor Castle, where it was on display for a number of years. In audio commentary for exhibition visitors, Charles says about the cloak: Since, as a child, I first caught sight of this cloak in the Grand Vestibule at Windsor, I have been fascinated by the sheer magic of the colour, the dashing pattern of the lining and the enthralling story of Napoleon himself which it conjures up. It is said to have been worn by the Emperor during his Egyptian campaign and was taken from his carriage after the Battle of Waterloo 15 years later. The artwork is arranged on the walls of an octagonal room with tables filled with books by Charles, family snaps, vases and other decorative objects, while above are hung rows of paintings and other artworks, some with a tapestry as a backdrop. Vanessa Remington, senior curator of paintings at the Royal Collection Trust, said: It\u0027s a departure because it is not a standard museum display and the works aren\u0027t shown in isolation, they\u0027re shown in profusion very, very densely.  (Tables) are dressed with a range of objects and those are intended to show or give a flavour of the interiors of the Prince of Wales\u0027s own residences because this is a very personal show. The exhibition creates the impression of different areas of a drawing room from the prince\u0027s official London home Clarence House or his country retreat Highgrove in Gloucestershire. Ms Remington, curator of the exhibition, said the pieces do not have explanatory text next to them as they wanted to create a visual display rather than a museum display. In one section, painted oil sketches of William and Harry by Nicola Philipps are hung next to watercolours painted by Charles in the 1990s on the Queen\u0027s private Balmoral estate. Below are marble busts of the prince\u0027s great-great-great-grandparents Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, who themselves were well-known art lovers.  In the audio commentary, Charles says: I am very fond of the two preparatory oil sketches of my sons which I acquired from the artist, Nicky Philipps, in 2009. They were painted for a double portrait that now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery. Both are dressed in the regimental uniform of the Household Cavalry - the Blues and Royals - and are particularly good likenesses. The attraction also features work from students and artists from Charles\u0027s three arts organisations, the Royal Drawing School, the Prince\u0027s Foundation School of Traditional Arts and Turquoise Mountain, based in Kabul, Afghanistan. Some of their contributions feature Islamic-inspired artwork and other traditions from the Middle East, including a moving triple portrait of three Yezidi women painted in Iraq by Hannah Rose Thomas, after they had escaped Isis captivity.

The private island, one of the Grenadines, is home to 100 luxury villas and subject to a no-fly zone to protect the privacy of its super-rich inhabitants. Kate\u0027s parents, Carole and Michael, are also believed to be in Mustique, where they own a holiday home.

And she\u0027s only three years old.  So far this year she\u0027s already made history by becoming the first British princess to retain her place in line of succession to the throne - despite the birth of her brother, Prince Louis .  She\u0027s also somewhat of a fashionista and often steals the show at royal events - take Louis\u0027 christening for example. And if there was any doubt as to just how fabulous the little princess is, it\u0027s about to vanish. That\u0027s because it\u0027s been revealed that Charlotte is worth more money than both of her brothers.   Reader\u0027s Digest have estimated the net worth of each member of the royal family.  Prince George is thought to be worth around \u0026pound2.7billion, with Louis, who was only born in April already predicted to boost the UK economy by \u0026pound50million before he turns one. However Charlotte takes the cake with a net worth of a whopping $5billion - that\u0027s \u0026pound3.8billion.  These calculations were based on the value the children bring to the economy, with the belief that the children have the potential to drive sales. The reason for Charlotte\u0027s incredibly high value is said to be predominantly due to her style influence, with people rushing out to buy the items she wears for their children. Often these pieces are purchased from high street brands and so are easier to get hold of and sell out in the blink of an eye - this is known as the Charlotte effect.

At Dave Lancaster\u0027s heaviest, he had type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, joint pain, high cholesterol, the beginnings of gout and sleep apnoea – a condition which can see a person stop breathing in their sleep. He said his immobility turned him into a recluse and although he was getting bigger, he felt \u0027his world was shrinking\u0027. But the call centre manager joined Slimming World in April 2016 and began walking every day - clocking up the total of a distance greater than from San Francisco to New York and back again​. He has lost 20stone 8lbs and no longer needs any medication for his health conditions. And he doesn\u0027t have to worry about fitting in seats on public transport, breaking benches or garden furniture anymore. The 45-year-old has gone from 34stone 8lbs and wearing a size 8XL with a 66in waist to 14stone and wearing size L clothes with a 36in waist.  Dave said: “I found it difficult to walk to the end of my road, I went out so rarely except for work that I was close to becoming a recluse and I was nearing almost complete immobility. It felt as though as I was getting bigger and bigger, my world was gradually shrinking.” But after changing his lifestyle, Dave said: “I can fit in the seat of any car I like and on buses, trains and planes. I don’t have to worry about breaking benches or garden furniture anymore. I can buy clothes on the high street and put my own socks on easily I can walk miles and run up and down the stairs - the list is endless. Dave, who lives alone in his hometown of Warwick, had been overweight all his life, apart from a brief period aged 16 to 18. He tried a range of weight-loss methods, including losing 10stone on a meal replacement diet in 2007. But he says it failed to educate him about food and he regained the weight he lost soon after. It was in April 2016 when Dave decided to give Slimming World a try and joined the local group run by his former neighbour Angie Baker.  I got a huge shock when I stepped on the scales and discovered I was nearly 3stone heavier than I’d expected, he said. I couldn’t believe what I’d done to my body and that evening, I’m not ashamed to say, I cried.” The following day though Dave filled his cupboards with healthy ingredients, cooking a range of dishes including stir-fries, salads and pasta from scratch. He said: “I like the emphasis on eating food that you prepare yourself rather than ready meals and processed food. And I found that I could still eat hearty meals while losing weight.” As Dave became more confident in the kitchen, he also began to share his creations with the rest of his slimming group via social media and posted about his weight-loss journey online.  He says the support he receives from others in person and online is invaluable. Inspired by other slimmers, Dave also began to be more active. He started walking around his local park, going from one bench to the next until he could walk longer distances without needing regular breaks.

The boys, aged just 14 when they put the plan together, had a hit-list of targets including students and teachers who had bullied or wronged them.  Reporting restrictions have been lifted which means we can now name them as Thomas Wyllie, the older teen, and Alex Bolland, younger. The first page of a chilling diary recovered from the home of Wyllie read: Sorry if this is found I have committed one of the worst atrocities in British history or I killed myself. Police also discovered an arsenal of screws, flammable fluid and boards at his hideout. Today Bolland was given a 10-year prison sentence and Wyllie was jailed for 12 years.  Following their arrests in October 2017, both boys tried to claim the Yorkshire plot was nothing more than a fantasy. But sentencing the pair, Judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said it was a firm plan with specific targets in mind using indiscriminate explosives. She described the pair\u0027s friendship as a noxious relationship, adding those two saw themselves as anti-heroes, with the power to choose who lives and who died. As well as professing his love of murderers in the book, Wyllie also drew a picture of what prosecutors described as the perfect school shooter. During a trial at Leeds Crown Court, prosecutors told how the pair were pupils at a school in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, in 2017.  They had hero-worshipped Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris - two teenagers who took up arms and killed 13 people in 1999 at the Columbine High School in Colorado. Jurors were told how the plans that the two put together went beyond the realms of fantasy as they downloaded bomb-making manuals, looked into purchasing weapons and warned friends of what was to come.  Wyllie, who has been described as the leader and main instigator, discussed his motivations for the attack in a diary which laid out what was later described as his twisted ideology. In a secret hideout in Catterick Garrison, he had kept a rucksack filled with screws, boards and flammable liquid, which prosecutors suggested were instruments for making an explosive device which was to be part of the killing. Prosecutors told how Wyllie had also warned his then-girlfriend that he wanted to murder her parents, so that he could run away with her and become a natural born killer.  The journal he kept also features a page of stuff we need to execute the plan, including napalm, firearms and pipe bombs. In it, he apologised for potentially committing one of the worst atrocities in British history. Bolland gave clear and unvarnished confessions of the plot to another friend, refuting suggestions that it was a joke and telling her: No one innocent will die. We promise.  When his co-conspirator lost interest in carrying out the plot, Wyllie described him to her girlfriend as his Dylan Klebold and repeatedly asked her to access her father\u0027s shotguns. In evidence, the girl\u0027s mother said: He\u0027s devious and primitive and had quite a lot of power and control over what, at the time, was our vulnerable daughter.  Both were interviewed by North Yorkshire Police, who later accepted that they did not meet those standards that are expected in the way they dealt with the boys. Leeds Crown Court heard how Wyllie had started researching the Columbine massacre again within minutes of the officers leaving, despite having denied plans for the attack. In opening the case, prosecutor Paul Greaney QC said: Eighteen years after the Columbine Massacre and nearly 4,500 miles away, two young teenagers in North Yorkshire became fascinated with Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. They intended a re-enactment of the Columbine High School Massacre although fortunately, in the result, they were stopped before their plans were put into action.

Known as the \u0027Man of the Hole\u0027, or also the \u0027indigenous man in the hole\u0027, the tribesman can be seen wearing a loin cloth while hacking at a tree with a homemade tool. The footage was captured by Government officials in the jungle of Rondonia, Brazil. The man was first discovered by experts in 1996, while his face was filmed for the first time in 1998. It\u0027s thought he has spent the last 22 years alone after five of his fellow tribes people were murdered by farmers more than two decades ago.  Experts believe the \u0027indigenous man in the hole\u0027 is in his 50s and has spent his whole life surviving on pigs, birds, monkeys and plants of the jungle. Armed with homemade tools, like a bow and arrow, the man\u0027s life is believed to be dedicated almost entirely to hunting. Due to strict laws around interaction with isolated tribesmen, the Brazilian government know little about the man, including his name, age and original make-up of his tribe. Despite researchers monitoring him since his first discovery in 1996, the man has only been captured on film once before now.

We just captured events and places that we thought were significant,” he said.“There are photos of people, of events, the arts, dance activities, things such as the New Year’s Day Dook and a lot of buildings that we thought either were significant or would become significant.“I was given access to Dens Park, for example, because I imagine in 10 years or so it might no longer exist as we know it.“I’m quite surprised at what we’ve been able to achieve.”The Tele was given access to some of the archive and the differences in city life now and then are stark.The 1916 survey features street scenes in the city centre and atop the Hilltown – and couldn’t be any more different from the snaps from 1991.Many of the later images show the city at its post-industrial peak, complete with questionable fashion choices and a City Square yet to be pedestrianised.Red Sky’s modern day survey is packed with sights that are likely to be familiar now – the new railway station entrance under construction, rusted-in tram rails on the Murraygate and dance performances in front of Caird Hall.Rather topically, there are also photos of William Halley’s mill – now reduced to rubble.Alistair Wilson, of Dundee Libraries, said the relevance of these photographic surveys becomes very clear after just a few years, giving people a fresh perspective on a city that might have changed without them really noticing.“The 1991 survey was carried out by Dundee Photographic Society. It and the other surveys act like a social record of how the city was at that time,” he said.“Looking back at 1991, which doesn’t feel that long ago, you can see so many things have changed – the way people dress, the jobs they have, even the cars on the streets.“Once the exhibition finishes the plan is that it will move about so everyone can see it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united set to announce signing eleventh signing of the summer","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United are set to unveil former Falkirk defender Paul Watson.The 27-year-old will be Csaba Laszlo\u0026#8217s eleventh signing of the summer.Watson made 49 appearances for the Bairns in a three-year spell before being released by Paul Hartley at the end of last season.The centre back made 24 appearances last season \u0026#8211 including Falkirk\u0026#8217s 6-1 mauling of United in January.More soon\u0026#8230\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b44857272341-e1531222515578-803x564.jpg ","title":"fans given chance to say last goodbye to dundee legend alan gilzean as casket laid in dens park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee fans are being invited to pay their last respects to club legend Alan Gilzean ahead of his funeral.The ceremony will take place at Dundee Crematorium on Friday at 12.30pm, with close family and friends invited.Ahead of the ceremony, \u0026#8216Gillie\u0026#8217s\u0026#8217 family have allowed Dees a chance to say goodbye to the man who was part of the 1962 league winning side.His casket will be laid in the Alan Gilzean lounge within Dens Park tonight from 5.30pm to 7.30pm.Supporters looking to go along can enter the stadium through the Main Door beside the reception.On Friday Alan\u0026#8217s body will pass Dens Park one last time around 11.55am as the funeral cortege goes down the Provost Road.It will also pass Dens Road, Strathmartine Road, Clepington Road, McAlpine Road before making its way to the crematorium.Supporters are again invited to pay their respects along the route.Alan Gilzean made 190 appearances for Dundee and scored a remarkable 169 goals, making him to this day the side’s all-time top scorer.After his seven years in the Dark Blue of Dundee he moved to Tottenham where he also became a legend.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/Traffic-Scotland-tweet.jpg ","title":"give alan gilzean a proper dens park send off says dundee ace cammy kerr","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee favourite Cammy Kerr has called on the club’s supporters to give Alan Gilzean the send off the Dens legend deserves this weekend.The Dark Blues take on Dunfermline this Sunday in the first home game since Gilzean passed away at the age of 79.The club legend’s funeral takes place tomorrow and Sunday’s clash promises to be one full of emotion for everyone associated with Dundee.A special matchday programme will be available while there will be a minute’s silence and black armbands worn by the players but Kerr expects a bumper home crowd to give Gilzean a roaring send-off.The 22-year-old said: “It’s a terrible thing to happen.“Sadly, I never got to see him play or have the privilege of meeting him but what a figure to have played at this football club.“To know you are at the same football club as some of the greatest footballers have played at is fantastic.“I’d like to send my regards and best wishes to his family at this time, obviously a tough time.“In terms of the game, I think it will be emotional and, hopefully, the crowd turn out for a very special player for this football club.“I’ve read a few of things in the papers about the player he was and I actually remember watching the thing on TV at White Hart Lane when they closed the old stadium.“I knew he was a good player but I didn’t know how big he was for Tottenham.“When they said ‘The Original King of White Hart Lane, Alan Gilzean’ it just shows the regard he was held in down there.“Naming a lounge after him doesn’t do him justice because he was, obviously, a great talent.”Being a fan himself, Kerr knows the kind of supporters Dundee have and the loyalty they show their team – something he experienced in a very noisy welcome and send-off at last week’s friendly against Farense in Portugal.“We could hear them when we got off the bus in Albufeira but you can’t see how many there were,” Kerr added.“At the end I got a few photos and things and they were singing away.“The best bit was when we were leaving and they were all banging on the bus – it was great!“You see European games and all the fans waiting on the buses so it felt like that, it felt great.“For the fans to go across there just shows the loyalty that they’ll go across to Portugal for a friendly.

The groundsmen do a great job to give us a good pitch.“It’s always good to come out and have a game on the TV, it’s exciting, but Dunfermline are a side that will definitely try to push this year.“They’ve made some really important signings throughout their side and they’ll be a really tough test, so we’ll have to be firing on all cylinders.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51a9f41666b-e1532096343192.jpg ","title":"look out for these local men in the crystal maze tonight","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA group of Angus men will star in The Crystal Maze tonight.The Gamers team all hail from the county and applied to take part in the iconic show, which returned in 2016 after more than 20 years off the screen.William Stephen, 30, filled out the application on behalf of his team mates Matt Shaw, Neil McGregor, Ross Gauld and Matthew Tosh.Self-confessed Crystal Maze nut William, who runs Yard’s Games in Arbroath, said: “I’ve been able to see the episode ahead of time and there are a couple of moments that will be memorable, without a shadow of a doubt.“To be on the show is quite surreal – it was a ‘pinch me to see if it’s real’ sort of moment.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"man battered his mum with banana at dundee home","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA fruit-wielding thug who assaulted his mother with a banana had sentence deferred until August 7 at Dundee Sheriff Court.Graeme Murray, 40, of Exchange Street, admitted four charges dating from April 7, all committed at an address in Balunie Avenue.He admitted that on various occasions he behaved in a threatening or abusive manner by shouting, swearing, uttering threats of violence and banging on a fridge and a door.He also admitted that on various occasions he assaulted his mother Doreen Murray, 64, by pushing her against a worktop, seizing her by the hair, repeatedly hitting her head and body with a banana, throwing a banana at her and pushing her on a bed to her injury.He further admitted assaulting his stepfather James Murray, then aged 71, by seizing his head and repeatedly punching his head.He also admitted assaulting PC Ryan Shields by attempting to butt him.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4f0793923bf-771x564.jpg ","title":"stirling albion or celtic its all the same to dundee new boy jean mendy","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn his very short time at Dundee, Senegalese striker Jean Mendy has already shown he can get fans off their seats at Dens Park this season.And he plans to continue doing that – as well as getting goals – whether he’s playing against Stirling Albion or Celtic, it’s all the same to him.He told the Tele: “I don’t know the teams at the moment!“For me, playing Stirling is like playing against Celtic, it’s the same for me – I just play my game, it doesn’t matter, and try to win every game.”The 28-year-old was delighted to start his career in dark blue with a goal after he knocked in a good strike from the edge of area as his new team began the season with a morale-boosting 4-0 victory at Stirling Albion.“It was good and we won of course – it’s very important to start winning,” Mendy added.“It was a little bit hot, I think, on the pitch on Saturday, we could feel it.“The performance was good, can be better you know, it was the first game but it was good to get the confidence with this game.“It was great for the team to score a lot of goals and we have shown we have people who can score.“I was pleased to get the goal, I got the chance and I put it in.“It was perfect for me to start with a goal and good for my confidence so I’m very happy to start like this.”Mendy joined the club from Belgian top-flight side Lokeren where he struggled to make an impact.That was after piling in the goals in the Norwegian lower leagues.Back in 2012, he banged in 27 goals in 25 league games for Elverum in the third tier before 27 in 52 in the next tier for Kristiansund. A move up to the top flight only brought a return of six in 23 for Sandefjord before returning to Kristiansund and then getting the big move to Belgium.Manager Neil McCann said he’d been keeping an eye on Mendy’s progress after missing out on him when he departed Norway.He’s finally got his man and the forward is delighted to be at Dundee, even if he’s not spent much time in the city with the club spending a week-long training camp in Portugal.He said: “I’ve enjoyed my time so far, it’s a good club with good players, too, and I think this year will be a good one.“Portugal was a lot of training. That sort of preparation is normal and it was good for us but you feel it when we played the games over there.“We didn’t get the wins in the friendlies, maybe one win against Sunderland but we lost the last two but they were only friendlies – more important is winning the games when the season begins, like Saturday.“It was very good to show we are ready.“There are a few new players, myself as well, and it’s very important for us to get together with the team and start to know each other in training, talk together and know how we all play.“It’s looking good. We’ll obviously continue to work more but I think the season will be good.”After starting off Group D with victory, Mendy and his new team-mates take on Dunfermline at home in front of the television cameras on Sunday.Even if he doesn’t know much about his opponents just yet, Mendy knows the Dundee fans will be expecting a good show from their side and he’s hoping to add to his goal tally.“I’m looking forward to my first home game this weekend.“That will be very important in front of our supporters.“Of course, we want to play a good game, put on a show for the fans and win the game, too.“We are going for a victory.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"wake me up before you coco wham star has coffee at dundee cafe","story":"\t\t\t\t\tClub Tropicana doesn\u0026#8217t open until later on a Friday so Wham! star Andrew Ridgeley had to make do for a Dundee coffee shop instead.The 55-year-old stopped off at Coffee \u0026amp Co on Reform Street for a bite today \u0026#8211 but the drinks weren\u0026#8217t quite for free.The founder of the eighties pop legends had been in area after visiting The Open in Carnoustie yesterday.Staff members were left debating whether the customer, who entered the cafe around 9.15am, was George Michael\u0026#8217s band member or not.Coffee \u0026amp Co boss Heather Sharpe decided to find out for definite.She told the Tele: \u0026#8220Everybody my age was a Wham! fan.(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]  if (d.getElementById(id)) return  js = d.createElement(s) js.id = id  js.src = \u0027https://connect.facebook.net/en_GB/sdk.js#xfbml=1\u0026version=v3.0\u0027  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, \u0027script\u0027, \u0027facebook-jssdk\u0027))Look who popped in for a coffee \u0026amp toast \u0026#8230.only my old mate Andrew Ridgeley from Wham!!

He has also raised concerns at Westminster about such firms on several occasions.He said: \"People should not be charged inflated fees when they have paid for parking in good faith.\"The British Parking Association confirmed to me in person it is their view that people should not be charged if they have made an error inputting their registration.\"This guidance must be heeded by parking operators and, where it is not, there needs to be greater enforcement.\"He added: \"It is high time that operators like Smart Parking were removed from our city centres once and for all.\"The MP was responding to the case of Roger High, from Nottinghamshire, who failed to persuade Smart Parking to overturn a charge issued to him and will now have to cough up \u0026pound100.He said: \"In my appeal I explained that I had transposed two of the letters [in my registration number] and the fact that the registration number was so similar to my postcode that it was easy to make such a small slip.\"I was appalled and livid to receive an email rejecting my appeal, even though they acknowledged that I had purchased a car parking ticket, on the grounds that I had not purchased it for the correct registration number.\"Visiting the area frequently to see family, Mr High insisted Smart Parking\u0027s actions \"would not change\" his love of this part of the world.However, he revealed the experience had left him \"miserable and depressed as well as outraged\".Highland Council trading standards officer William Paul, who has been involved in long-running discussions with Smart Parking, said he was surprised to hear about Mr High\u0027s problems, believing there had been positive changes at the site.It is understood ticket machine key pads have been made bigger to reduce the chance of errors and new software aims to eliminate charges being issued when easily detectable genuine mistakes are made.\"We are encouraged by recent improvements in the operating procedures of the car park and to be fair to the company, these improvements do seem to be making a difference,\" he said.\"We are assured that these improvements are based on a firm commitment to resolve the previous reported issues, including incorrect vehicle registration mark (VRM) entries.\"He encouraged any drivers affected by charge notices to follow Smart Parking\u0027s appeals system and, if necessary, report the matter via the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506 or at www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumerA spokesman for Smart Parking said: \"It is a contractual requirement for motorists to input their correct registration mark when parking at Strothers Lane Car park and failure to do so is a breach of the terms and conditions of parking there which can result in a Parking Charge Notice being issued.\"However Smart Parking acknowledges that motorists can make minor mistakes when entering their registration and as such working closely with Highland Trading Standards, has put in place measures to try to identify genuine mistakes against actual registration marks using the car park. Where the mistake is minor and the actual registration mark can be cross referenced Smart parking will endeavour to identify this and not issue the Parking Charge notice.\"Motorists are encouraged to double check their registration number before entering it and if those using the car park have entered a registration mark and subsequently received a Parking Charge Notice they are encouraged to engage with Smart Parking through our British Parking Association accredited appeals process.\"Friday 20 Jul 2018 9:35

suspension bridge linking Bught Road with Whin Island will close this Monday for \"essential repairs\" as part of wider refurbishment of footpaths within the Ness Islands.The move will temporarily cut off access to the beauty spot from the west side of the River Ness at a time when visitor numbers are at their highest.And that decision has sparked questions from puzzled councillors, who have asked why work is beginning now \u0026ndash 13 months after the cash for it was signed off and three months after work elsewhere on the latest phase got underway.They have also criticised the short one week notice period given to the public.Inverness West councillor Alex Graham, said: \"It was very disappointing that [the public] were given such short notice of the work, particularly because it is used as the main access to the Ness Islands from the Bught side [of the river] and of course it\u0027 also part of the Great Glen Way route as well so it\u0027 important to tourists as well as locals.\"I

work?\"Inverness Central councillor Bet McAllister also raised concerns, and highlighted the impact the closure could have on people heading to and from local events, such as the open air Little Mix concert on Sunday, July 29.She added that if the work needed settled weather and low river levels, it could have been carried out months before now thanks to the exceptionally dry spring and summer the Highlands has experienced.\"I can\u0026rsquot understand it,\" she said. \"Why not start in April or early May \u0026ndash they could have had it done.\"I\u0026rsquom not happy with the timing,

If it was that dangerous and bad why not carry out the work before. And if it\u0027 not dangerous why not leave it [to a quieter time]?\"\"They could easily do it in September.\"Highland Council insisted the timing was due to the need for a settled weather window, and that the Monday start date was designed to avoid this weekend\u0027 Inverness Highland Games.A spokeswoman said: \"The council apologises for any inconvenience that this will cause and is mindful of the fact that the closure is taking place throughout the summer, however the works are necessary for the essential maintenance of the bridge and the closure is for public safety.\"The timing of the refurbishment in the summer season is necessary as it provides the best weather conditions to get the work done safely with lower river levels.\"Meanwhile, the council has urged the public to stop attaching so-called \u0026lsquolove locks\u0026rsquo to bridges, and plans to remove any it finds during the repair work. It also called on people not to place stickers on lamps, benches or bridges.\"The padlocks cause rust and both stickers and padlocks damage paintwork,\" they said. \"All existing padlocks and stickers

result of the new Aberdeen exhibition centre being renamed.There are 26 signs on the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route directing traffic to the new complex on the A96 – which last week announced it would be renamed the Event Complex Aberdeen (TECA).That means all of the signs saying “AECC” will need to be altered or even replaced.It is understood the cost of making the changes will fall to the centre’s owner SMG Europe.However, it has not yet been decided if that will involve altering or removing the incorrect signs.Any changes can be requested by the developer – in this case SMG – and Transport Scotland, along with the local authority, will make the alterations.A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “The strategic signing policy was agreed with the local authority and any changes to the signage has to be agreed with them.”An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said changes “would have to be agreed with Transport Scotland” and referred inquiries to TECA’s operator SMG Europe.A spokeswoman for SMG Europe, which operates the venue, would only say: “Discussions are under way into this matter.”SNP group leader councillor Stephen Flynn said it would be “beyond embarrassing” if the signage was wrong.He said: “I agree with those folk who have said that TECA is a fairly uninspiring name change and would prefer not to see it on any sign.“However, if they are to press ahead with the new title then it would be beyond embarrassing not to have signage to match.“Ultimately, it’s really poor that there doesn’t appear to have been much, if any, communication between partners on such a simple issue and any changes shouldn’t be borne by the public purse.”Liberal Democrat councillor Ian Yuill added: “It is important that the signage is clear.“Given that SMG Europe decided on a different name for the AECC and that TECA will be its name going forward, it makes sense that the signs should use that name.“I do believe that SMG Europe should be fronting any costs to make those changes.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/Cannonbawz-at-Ballindalloch-Castle.jpg-846x564.jpg ","title":"electrifying initiative links in with

League champions were beaten by 3-2 by Cowdenbeath in controversial fashion in the League Two Play-Off final at the end of last season.Cove felt Brad Smith’s winning goal shouldn’t have stood due to

will return to face the Blue Brazil in their third game of the League Cup group stage.Sheran, left, says any lingering frustration from the play-off defeat needs to be channelled into something positive.He said: “It’s just another game, the occasion is completely different to what it was the other time so it’s just another game.“Everybody is getting a bit too hung up on what happened before, it’s gone. “It’s a new season and a new set up and for us we don’t want to finish bottom of this group.“So Saturday and next Saturday (against Raith Rovers) we are maybe targeting as games we can win. The frustration will be there for a while but we just have to deal with it and channel it into something positive.”Having faced Inverness Caley Thistle and Hearts in their first two group stages matches, tomorrow’s game and the final fixture at home to League One Raith Rovers are more winnable games for Cove.Sheran added: “We should have a more even playing field in that they are not far apart from us in the league set up. “We think we might have more of a chance of winning so we’ll try to do that.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a look at the advertiser of yesteryear","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 11:54 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowWith the success of the Islay Mòd still fresh in our minds, it is clear that taking part in regional and the national Mòd is a long-standing tradition for Mid Argyll youngsters.For more than 20 years Mid Argyll students have done us proud at the Gaelic singing competitions, as seen here in our edition from 1998, when singers from all over Argyll made their way to the Royal National Mòd on the Isle of Skye.The Lochgilphead Primary Gaelic Choir came fourth in their competition, with the Lochfyneside Junior Gaelic Choir gaining top music mark in their unison singing competition.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema paradiso as screen machine parks up in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 1:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA familiar large blue lorry rolled into Lochgilphead recently, offering the latest movies to the public for two nights.The cinema on wheels parked itself outside Kilmory resource centre for movie buffs to enjoy on Tuesday July 10 and Wednesday July 11, with screenings of Gnomeo and Juliet sequel, Sherlock Gnomes superhero epic Avengers: Infinity War Part I and LGBT rom-com, Love, Simon.The Screen Machine has a busy few weeks ahead.

Council bosses have sized up the task, fearing the iconic structure has reached the end of the line. Large parts of Ayr railway station are closed to the public as safety teams comb the site. But the Post has learned that even a short-term salvage mission will cost more than \u0026pound300,000. Senior councillors have been briefed to expect a hefty hit to the wallet. South Ayrshire bosses will bid to retrieve whatever they spend from the hotel’s absentee Malaysian owner. But a senior adminsitration source said: “We have to face the reality of the situation. “The cost of refurbishing the hotel would be well in excess of \u0026pound10m, so that’s a non-starter. “I think that knocking it down is quickly becoming our only option.” That prospect is likely to face a strong challenge from groups such as Historic Scotland. And political tensions could further complicate the picture.  It comes as the hotel’s safety cordon was extended to take in part of the road over the railway. Teams are inspecting the condition of the building’s gable end amid concerns it could collapse on to people and cars below. Trains continue to run as normal, but access for commuters has now become fraught with difficulty. And worried rail chiefs are now said to be hatching contingency plans, should Ayr become become a no-go zone. But council bosses this week refused to confirm whether an official briefing on demolition had taken place. In a statement, they said: “Work to fully assess the condition of the former Station Hotel is continuing on site. “However, a decision on any future action will be dependent on the findings of the ongoing works and surveys.” But the council’s opposition group claim they are being kept in the dark over developments. Tory boss, Martin Dowey, said the public need to be kept informed. “I’m surprised this figure appears to be being quoted by members of the administration,” he added. “The SNP’s claim of inclusion and transparency is just one more empty promise. “The public need to be kept informed about the hotel and the council’s plans for its future, if that does indeed involve demolition.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnHistoric ScotlandScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTransportAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12945474.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_110718WINDOW_01JPG.jpg","title":"ayr window cleaner keith mckissock","story":"NewsAyr window cleaner Keith McKissock says South Ayrshire Council parking wardens are \"stopping\" him from workingFurious Keith McKissock claims he is being \"stopped\" from going about his business in Ayr town centre.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson10:49, 19 JUL 2018NewsKeith has won support from customers and some councillors (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA popular window cleaner claims council bosses are blocking his bid to work. Keith McKissock washes up to 50 properties – many of them businesses – in Ayr town centre. But the dad-of-two faces a stand-off with parking wardens on his tail. Keith, who runs Craigie Cleaning Services, wants a special permit allowing his van into town. But despite offers to pay an annual fee, red tape and fines have dogged his progress. The 53-year-old said: “I’m just trying to go about my work – what I do actually improves the town. “If I wasn’t cleaning these windows, would the council? “I can’t carry 22 litres of water on my back with all my ladders. “Maybe they expect me to balance everything on my bike.”  Keith, once a top Scottish cyclist, was backed all the way by customers this week. Kenny McLachlan, of Ayr, said: “Keith’s been washing our windows for five years and you couldn’t meet a harder working guy. “The High Street needs all the support it can get – we shouldn’t be harassing people doing it a turn.”  Now Tory councillors are  hoping to ride to the cleaner’s rescue by proposing a new parking charter.  Group chief Martin Dowey said: “Examples exist in other councils where they charge an annual window cleaner permit. “Keith is someone who legitimately services our High Street and there needs to be a common sense solution.” Ayrshire’s roads boss Stewart Turner said: “Vehicles can’t remain in the same location for longer than 10 minutes without activity. “In addition, it is not possible to move a vehicle from one bay to another in attempt to buy time. “In Mr McKissock’s case, he can use the bays to undertake cleaning operations but can’t use them to park or collect money from customers. “He was recently asked to move his vehicle from a bay by a parking attendant as he was not carrying out any window cleaning activities. “The Alliance wrote to Mr McKissock, once again, regarding his behaviour towards our parking attendants. “Our employees deserve to be treated with respect and we have a responsibility to protect them.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"former wwe star hurricane tops","story":"NewsFormer WWE star The Hurricane tops bill as Pro Wrestling Elite stages anniversary show at Ayr CitadelPWE will stage their latest extravaganza - and are promising fans one of their biggest and best shows yet.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet16:03, 19 JUL 2018NewsPWE will stage their big event this weekend (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGrappling fans are in for a treat this weekend as a host of wrestling stars will descend on Ayr.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12935909.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080618maragret_12JPG.jpg","title":"meet this weeks class act","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Class ActAyr United striker Michael Moffat popped along to Queen Margaret Academy to visit the youngsters who were holding a Soccer Aid event.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:12, 17 JUL 2018NewsMichael Moffat of Ayr United pictured with the senior sports leaders (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFooty fans and soccer stars joined together for a special charity event last month.

Catherine also works in the entertainment industry as a photobooth attendant for Foxy Photo booths. The couple are from Irvine and have two kids together, David, 9, and Darcy, 2. The pair met on a night out in November 2013 in Irvine town. Catherine said: “We exchanged numbers and the rest was history. “We dated for several months before Jamie settled into family life with my little boy David and since then the two of them have been inseparable.” The couple tied the knot on Friday, June 8 at the Gailes Hotel.  “We had a Rugby Glam theme with lots of sparkle,” said Catherine. “We had centre pieces with feathers, rugby balls going down the aisle and silver sparkly table covers. “My son David wrote and shared a reading at the ceremony, which no one knew about, for Jamie about how he has made his mum so happy and how he is proud that this man is his step dad. The bride wore a strapless princess ballgown with cathedral train and sparkly cathedral veil. The 32 layered dress was MoriLee from J’Taime Bridal in Stevenston. The groom and groomsmen wore full kilt attire from Kilts4U in Kilmarnock. The wedding party consisted of Maid of honour, auntie of the bride Anna Marie Darroch Bridesmaid, best friend Emma Sneddon Flowergirl, daughter Darcy Doolan Bride’s parents Luigi and Julie Coppola Best man, best friend Aaron Robertson Ushers, Craig Wilson and David Darroch, Page boy, son David and Groom’s parents Jim Doolan and Una Doolan.

Catherine said: “We were lucky enough that both sets of grandparents looked after the kids and we got a full seven nights in the Luxury Moon Palace Resort in Cancun, Mexico. “We were treated like royalty from the moment we walked off the plane - butler service, 24hr room service, chauffeur driven everywhere. “But, it rained 22 hours a day for almost six days out of seven so we were stuck inside felling like we were at Irvine beach not the Caribbean Coast! Hugh McFedries Photography and Magic Memories Videography captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to look back on. Flowers were arranged by Myra Craigen @ Balloons and Blooms and their cake created by Not Just Cake, Bellshill. Catherine said: “It was six tiers of white and sparkle- exactly what I had envision on my day. “It was made with different flavours but the Irn Bru and Toffee layers were our favourite.  Hair and Make-up was styled and created by Forever Diamonds, Prestwick Catherine added: “Hair and make up and all things beauty were done by my cousin Sean Diamond’s salon. His team worked very hard to give us exactly what we wanted. “We can not thank all our suppliers enough - but to the venue Gailes Hotel, the effort the staff put in down to every detail and ensuring everything ran on time and smoothly . “Also, our Venue dresser John at LG Wedding and events he made everything look so magical and sparkly, this guy is a miracle worker. “As I work in the industry and have met many brides over time, it was such a strange feeling having the day being about me and having my very own photobooth and marryoke that my boss Marc from Foxy Photobooth provided. “All my guests loved it and the marryoke video ‘She is a belter’ has hit 5k views.” For more photos of Catherine and Jamie\u0027s wedding, pick up your copy of this week\u0027s Ayrshire Post.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

And the telly alter egos of two of the guests were certainly more at home in a council tower block. For Tam and Isa actors in Still Game - Mark Cox and Jane McCarry - were among those clinking champagne glasses. It was staged at his country mansion near Dailly which has become the Scottish seat of Ferguson. The party follows shooting of his new movie has been filmed in Argyll. Along with 140 cast and crew he was staying near Arochar while filming for ‘Love You To Death’ at locations around Argyll and Bute.  Stars include male lead Craig, Craiglang favourite Ford Kiernan and Liz Hurley Producer Matthew Weiner - the creator of the hit TV series Mad Men, said: “Our experience of filming in Argyll and Scotland as a whole has been phenomenal, we have never felt so welcomed and supported as Americans.” Sources say the party was a grand affair, with “lots of great people.” One guest said: “Craig really put on a show and his house is incredible. “As well as actors some of the Ayrshire gentry were there. They had a ball . . . and it was so funny to see ‘Tam and Isa’ there. “Craig is a huge fan of Still Game and appeared in it alongside Jane and Mark. “While Jane and Mark had no problem fitting in to the glamour surroundings, Tam and Isa would have been completely overawed.”  Craig bought his Ayrshire property for \u0026pound2million cash six years ago, bidding over the \u0026pound1.85m asking price. The 56-year-old was once the highest earning talk show host in the US, taking home \u0026pound8m a year. He fell in love with the mansion in the Girvan Valley and was keen to have a Scots base for his three sons. The house is 336 years old and has 14 receptions and 15 bedrooms over four floors. But it also boasts facilities fit for a Hollywood superstar with cinema, games room, billiard room, gym and tennis court. Craig has kept a low profile since, but four years ago popped up to watch the panto at the Ayr Gaiety with the family and wife Megan. Amazingly he actually trod the Gaiety boards 20 years ago in a touring show, starring with the late Gerard Kelly in ‘The Odd Couple.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"vandal hunt after cars vandalised","story":"NewsVandal hunt after cars are vandalisedNeighbours are furious about old cars the owner refuses to move\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston12:29, 18 JUL 2018Updated12:33, 18 JUL 2018NewsFour motors are always parked at Raithhill (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIT’S a highly curious tale that’s causing unrest in an Alloway neighbourhood. A line of four cars all belonging to the same man have hardly turned a wheel for more than a DECADE. The road beneath them is a weed and dirt splattered state, tarnishing the pleasant surroundings of the horseshoe-shaped Raithhill. Every year the forlorn fleet is removed with the help of the AA to ensure they get their MOT and are road legal. And when they are away, a reserve takes their place in case someone else grabs the spot. Last week the story emerged as the cars’ owner Derek Cumming - who runs a chartered accountancy business in Ayr - told police his cars had been vandalised. Police then issued a statement saying the damage had been of “significant financial impact on the owners of these vehicles.” Ayr CID said they are “speaking to the community and reviewing CCTV” and added damage happened between May 1 and June 26. But far from sympathy from residents who insisted the cars were a menace and claimed Mr Cumming couldn’t care less about the annoyance they caused. Neighbours claimed Mr Cumming does not stay in the villa, which was owned by his late mother, and that he lives in nearby Glenalla Crescent. Meanwhile, the cars remain at Raithhill. Usual residents are an 18-year-old silver AUDI TT convertible, two Mercedes SL500’s aged 10 and 11 and usually a Range Rover rather than the 16-year-old Toyota Avensis. On closer inspection there is no significant vandalism to the four cars currently there other than a few minor scrapes and scratches. The Audi and the red Mercedes have small scrapes to the pavement side which look like it has been “keyed.” The Mercedes also has a small panel missing next to the rear window. Residents queued-up to tell the Ayrshire Post of their displeasure. One lady said: “You won’t get any sympathy for him here. Nobody can understand what he is playing at and he doesn’t care he causes us upset.” Another lady added: “In the winter when there is ice it is actually dangerous as we don’t want to hit his cars. “There is grass growing through the tarmac as the council road sweeper cannot get to it. “The so-called vandalism looks nothing to me . . . in fact if that is all there has been in 10 years then he should count himself lucky. “It was his mother’s house and his aunt also used to live there.” And a gent added: “It obviously costs money to keep them road legal and the cars are usually taken away at night so they can get a new MOT. “The batteries are down so the AA has to re-start them. “Three of the cars have private plates and he is doing nothing wrong, but the mind boggles as to why. “Sadly there doesn’t seem to be anything we can do about it but it seems they are there to spite someone and is so infantile. “He once put flower pots down his driveway because he thought neighbours were parking there.” Sixty-three-year-old Mr Cumming runs an accountancy firm in Cathcart Street. This week he was unrepentant he was causing the neighbours stress. Asked why the cars had been there for up to 13 years, he replied: “Because that is my home.” When it was put to him that he actually lived in Glenalla Crescent, he said: “That’s my home. Nothing is bizarre. I do live in the house. “Don’t report anything outwith the police report. “I can park cars legally and that is the end of the matter. I have no further comment.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

Mrs Cavers is principal guidance teacher with Moray house and Mr Gellaitry is principal guidance teacher at Grange house.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.

Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.

Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.

The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park. That would require special funding applications.  Stuart Gibb, area manager of Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership (DELAP), said that consultation had already taken place with groups such as DELAP and the town\u0026rsquos community council, as well as various departments of East Lothian Council.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe area partnership is supporting the acknowledgement that the town is getting bigger.  \u0026ldquoFacilities and amenities need to be on the ball in terms of that growth to ensure that we have suitable and sustainable facilities moving forward."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8055467.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scottish-open-the-renaissance-club-to-stage-2019-tournament","story":"  This year\u0027s tournament is due to get under way tomorrow (Thursday) at Gullane Golf Club and, in 12 months\u0027 time,\u0026nbspwill move just three miles along the coast as it is played at the Renaissance Club, at Archerfield.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done. They will be supported in this by a multi-disciplinary team from the partnership."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8061096.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bus-mounts-pavement-in-tranent","story":"  The 62-year-old, who was driving an empty Prentice coach at the time of the incident, is understood to have taken ill at the wheel as it pulled out from a bus stop.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.  The evening reception, attended by 700 people, was one of a series of events taking place around the UK to mark 70 years since the health service was founded.  During the engagement, Prince William watched a short film about the history of the NHS and listened to singing by the NHS Forth Valley Nurses Choir."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064994.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"rugby-stars-take-on-golfers-at-gullane-ahead-of-scottish-open","story":"  Scotland caps Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings faced off against South African Dean Burmester and New Zealander Ryan Fox in a \u0027rugby vs golf\u0027 challenge.\u0026nbsp  Kinghorn and Hastings kicked rugby balls around the championship course, while Fox and Burmester got some practice in earlier this week, with the rugby stars coming out on top 2-1.\u0026nbsp  Below is a video of the challenge. . .\u0026nbsp      Rugby \u0026#127386 Golf    With @LeuchieHouse and @MNDoddie5 as the official charities this week, we decided to have fun with a little #RugbyGolf challenge \u0026#127945\u0026#9971 pic.twitter/eCH0KBEjin  The Scottish Open\u0027s two charity partners this year are the My Name\u00275 Doddie Foundation, set-up by former Scotland rugby star Doddie Weir following his diagnosis with Motor Neurone Disease and Leuchie House, the North Berwick-based national respite charity of which Adam\u0027s dad Gavin Hastings is patron."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8070351.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"all-the-latest-from-day-three-of-the-scottish-open-at-gullane","story":"  He carded a two-under-par 68 in his third round today (Saturday) to lead the tournament at Gullane Golf Club.\u0026nbsp  He\u0026rsquos a shot clear of a six-strong group that includes American Rickie Fowler, the 2015 Scottish Open\u0026nbspchampion at Gullane.

The court documents relate to a civil action between Mr Banks\u0026rsquos diamond company Distribution Rocks and its partner firm, Supermix.  Channel Four News said the papers quote a former business partner as stating:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoI was finally made aware in October (2015) that in truth, Banks had been dealing with Russians who contemplated investing in the mines.  \u0026ldquoI was informed by Banks that he had travelled to Russia and discussed with them the diamond opportunities as well as gold mining opportunities in Russia.

The papers state:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThroughout the early part of 2015 Arron Banks was promising the imminent arrival of these funds. Construction of operation on the mine sites continued in expectation of the funds, however these funds were not forthcoming.  \u0026ldquoIt has recently become apparent that the funds were in fact raised but were used by Arron Banks in other interests that he has including but not limited to his participation in the funding of Brexit.  The documents also claim that Mr Banks planned to raise money from investors by issuing a bond, according to the programme.  The affidavit states: \u0026ldquoDuring the latter part of 2014 further funding was required for the various businesses.  \u0026ldquoBanks advised that he had various funding options open to him, one of which was to create a financial instrument (a diamond bond) whereby \u0026pound4 million and 5 million US dollars would be raised for the capitalisation of the business and the other was through a loan from Southern Rock, another Gibraltar headquartered insurance company belonging to Arron Banks and/or STM Life, also of Gibraltar, over which Arron Banks exerted significant influence, although he was not the majority shareholder.

The mines are historically significant assets and have been brought back into production over the last two years.  \u0026ldquoThe report was commissioned in order to raise finance to develop the mining group some five nonths before the general election where David Cameron promised to give the British public an in/out referendum on the EU.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed bond was considered in March 2015, two months before the general election and 12 months before the date of referendum was even announced by David Cameron.  \u0026ldquoIn the end, we did not proceed with the bond raise or any form of external fund raise.  \u0026ldquoUnless I was Mystic Meg, it would have been impossible to know that I would be involved in the referendum campaign or that it would even take place!  \u0026ldquoThe notion that Brexit was funded by the Russians is risible and just part of the continuing attacks on anyone involved with Brexit.  Mr Banks added: \u0026ldquoThe other evidence Channel 4 have provided is from a court filing by a former business partner responding to our claim of damages.  \u0026ldquoHe is currently under investigation by the South African Hawks for the theft of 4,000 carats from the mine, along with other alleged offences.  \u0026ldquoWe deny in full the allegations made in his affidavit and would comment that, since the referendum hadn\u0026rsquot even been announced, how would he know any funds were going to Brexit?

Mondelez said a team of 20 scientists, nutritionists and chocolatiers worked for almost two years at its Reading and Bournville units to cut sugar without adding any artificial sweeteners, colours or preservatives.  The calorie content remains similar between the two bars, but the sugar content has dropped from 56g per 100g in the original bar to 39g per 100g in the new version.

Longer term plans include a reformulation of Cadbury Brunch bars to cut sugar by around 20% and a lower sugar version of Oreo biscuits.  Mr Caton said the company recognised that consumers wanted to manage their sugar intake.  He said: \u0026ldquoOur brands have been around for hundreds of years. They are a part of British culture and heritage and play a special role in people\u0026rsquos lives as treats to be enjoyed during a moment of indulgence.  \u0026ldquoTaking sugar out of our products isn\u0026rsquot easy and will take time.

Football experts have already \u0026ldquored flagged moves for two internationalists - France\u0026rsquos Florent Sinama Pongolle and Russia\u0026rsquos Konstantin Rausch - which involved payments to opaquely owned firms registered in Edinburgh and London respectively.  British shell firms - marketed off-the-peg across the former Soviet Union and beyond as vehicles for secrecy and tax avoidance - have been embroiled in numerous major fraud, corruption and money-laundering scandals in recent years.  The UK Government this weekend ends a consultation on how to reform the most notoriously abused British corporate entity, the Scottish limited partnership or SLP.  Russian investigative journalists have revealed secret payments to an SLP when Mr Pongolle, a former Liverpool striker, was transferred from Sporting Lisbon to FK Rostov in 2012.  More recently Moscow\u0026rsquos Dinamo has dismissed its general director after discovering payments made to an English limited liability partnership or LLP when it signed Mr Rausch, a wing back, from Germany\u0026rsquos Koeln earlier this year.    Konstantin Rausch  SNP MP and Motherwell fan Alison Thewliss has been leading attempts to in the House of Commons to convince the Conservatives to take a tougher line on SLPs and UK corporate governance.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt seems there are no limits to the areas where dirty money, laundered through Scottish Limited Partnerships, will go.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos particularly frustrating to see this money seeping into football and the purchase of players - we all want to see our team win, but this shouldn\u0026rsquot come at any cost.  \u0026ldquoThe UK Government\u0026rsquos consultation on SLPs closes next week - they must use this opportunity to clamp down on dubious shell firms and protect the reputation of the beautiful game.    Alison Thewliss  Former Scottish First Minister Henry McLeish - a former professional footballer for Leeds United - has long been concerned about what he called \u0026ldquobackroom financial dealings in his sport.  Mr McLeish said: \u0026ldquoTo retain the trust and respect of supporters we must have probity and scrutiny. This extends to so-called shell companies  \u0026ldquoThe UK Government must clamp down on these structures. Football is global and so is finance. We have to be aware of what is happening in our sport: we need a clean game based on clean money.    Henry McLeish  Dynamo\u0026rsquos chairman Vladimir Strzhalkovsky discovered a payment of 1.25m euros to an LLP called Golden Toys, according to recent news media reports in both Germany and Russia. Mr Strzhalkovsky, a former KGB officer and tycoon close to Putin whose son bought a stately home in Scotland this year, is understood to have reported the matter to the authorities. There is no suggestion that Mr Rausch, who missed the World Cup through injury, was involved.  Moscow newspaper Novaya Gazeta uncovered a payment of 650,000 euros from Rostov to an SLP called Trademarket Networks as part of Mr Pongolle\u0026rsquos transfer. The paper cites bank records showing the money was passed on to a now closed English LLP called Drensler. From there, it alleges, cash ended up in the account of a club official.  Trademarket Networks, now dissolved was based at 78 Montgomery Street, Edinburgh, which hosts 3000 or so other \u0026ldquo. shells. The SLP was one of those used as part of the $1 billion robbery of three Moldovan banks. Densler also featured in the same case.

The organisers of the ECI cited Brexit as the reason for submitting the petition and the future possible loss of EU citizenship and rights by UK nationals.  \u0026ldquoThe main objective of the proposed initiative is to guarantee that European citizenship and its associated rights cannot be lost once they have been attained, the Commission said.  \u0026ldquoThe organisers cite in particular the context of Brexit and the future loss of EU citizenship and rights to UK citizens, it added.  A Commission spokesperson said that the decision to register the initiative concerns only the legal admissibility of the proposal and that it had yet not analysed the substance of the petition.    Petitioners will need to get a total of at least one million signatures\u0026nbspthat includes residents in at least seven EU nations.  The Commission can then decide either to back the request or not, and in both instances would be required to explain its reasoning.  The organisers say in the text of the petition that it aims to \"uphold the right of Union citizens to move and reside freely within the territory of member states under objective conditions of freedom and dignity\u0026nbspand to safeguard citizens of the Union from use as bargaining chips in negotiations under Article 50...\"  It requests the Commission \"submit a proposal to retain the rights of EU citizenship for all those who have already exercised their freedom of movement prior to the departure of a members state\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspleaving the Union, and for those nationals of a departing state who wish to retain their status as citizens of the union.\"  The organisers of the move which includes seven nationals from\u0026nbspBritain, France, Italy, Germany, Republic of Ireland, Greece and Belgium say a separate passport\u0026nbsp\"might be issued as a consequence of this\" if the suggestion is approved.  The organisers say: \"Retaining European Citizenship aims to appeal to all citizens of the European Union. Citizenship - and the rights and responsibilities that go with it - should not so easily be stripped away from European citizens.    \"We are concerned with those who wish to retain their citizenship, with EU nationals in the UK who face an uncertain future as a result of Brexit, with UK nationals residing in EU countries and with all those who want to defend their citizenship.\"  EU citizenship guarantees freedom of movement in the EU and other rights  Brits were expected to lose their EU citizenship after Brexit is in effect, either in March 2019 or at the end of the transition period in December 2020.  EU citizenship would not replace British nationality but would\u0026nbspbe additional to national citizenship.  It would grant specific rights such as the right to travel and live anywhere in the EU and the right to vote and stand as a candidate in European and local elections where they are living.  It would also\u0026nbspallows EU citizens to get diplomatic protection and consular help from any EU country wherever they are in the world, even if their own country does not have a local embassy.  The petition asks that people who wish to retain their EU citizenship after Brexit be allowed to do so.  The UK is on course to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 - two years after Prime Minister Theresa May triggered the exit process by invoking Article 50.  And Westminster\u0026nbsphas been adamant that free movement would end at the end of the transition period in December 2020.  In a parliamentary answer on the citizenship question, Lord Ahmad of the Foreign Office said \"when the UK ceases to be a member of the European Union, British nationals will no longer hold EU citizenship, unless they hold dual nationality with another EU member state\".  Lord Callanan of the Department for Exiting the European Union said retaining EU citizenship for Britons post-Brexit had not been ruled out, but it \"would involve changing treaties\". \"The other side [EU negotiators] has shown no interest whatever in doing it,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"councils-set-to-be-handed-powers-to-banish-lap-dancing-clubs","story":"  A new licensing regime would hand local authorities greater control over the number of sexual entertainment venues operating in their boundaries.  But women\u0026rsquos groups have called for politicians to go further and implement an outright ban across Scotland such as that introduced in Iceland in 2010.  Cosla, which represents local government and lobbies on its behalf, backed giving councils \u0026ldquothe ability to control the number and location of such venues in their areas.  Responding to a consultation on the proposals, it said it was \u0026ldquovery difficult to see how a commitment to eradicating violence against women and girls could sit alongside the licensing of sexual entertainment venues.  It said current Government guidance \u0026ldquodoes not recognise that working in the sexual entertainment industry is for most people not about choice, but about exploitation, and one in which women are disproportionately represented.  Violence Against Women Partnerships (VAWP) insisted the Scottish Government should work with councils to outlaw lap-dancing clubs.  But venue operators said it was \u0026ldquounfair and untrue to imply that lap-dancing is a form of violence against women.  Brightcrew, operators of Platinum Lace in Glasgow, argued its performers \u0026ldquoare all strong, independent, talented women who choose to work in sexual entertainment.  It added: \u0026ldquoIt is a well-remunerated occupation. It is a form of performance. It provides great flexibility in terms of hours and days of work, meaning that performers can work when they like, ensuring that they can find a balance between their work and other demands on their time, be it family, other work or studies.  The Scottish Government said it would consider the consultation responses before bringing in new rules.  Provisions to create a new licensing regime were voted through Holyrood in 2015 as part of the Air Weapons and Licensing (Scotland) Act.  The legislation allows councils to decide whether they want to licence sexual entertainment venues and set the number able to operate in their area.  A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoLicensing of sexual entertainment venues does not seek to ban lap dancing or strip clubs but to allow local licensing authorities to decide what is right for their area.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government accepts the freedom of adults to engage in legal activities and employment.  \u0026ldquoHowever, it will continue to promote, through all relevant means, gender equality and actions that tackle out-dated attitudes that denigrate or objectify particular groups or individuals."},{"url":null,"title":"bifab-workers-accuse-bosses-of-ditching-full-time-staff-in-favour-of-agencies","story":"  In a statement addressed to Scottish ministers, they said such a move would \u0026ldquoseriously damage any hope of winning new contracts.

Last week, unions warned the yards \u0026ndash located in Fife and Lewis \u0026ndash were now effectively closed with almost no workers left on the sites.  In their statement, the workforce said the new owners had not engaged with union leaders, and were instead seeking to replace experienced staff with agency employees.  The BiFab yards previously had a core workforce of 400 and a further 1,000 contractors.  Scottish Labour\u0027s economy spokeswoman Jackie Baillie insisted the claims raised \u0026ldquoserious questions about the SNP Government\u0027s recent handling of the crisis.  She said: \"Trade unions and the workforce deserve praise for their courageous fight to protect jobs.  \"Laying off the highly-skilled core workforce would devastate families and communities \u0026ndash and lead to a loss of skills and experience that would be impossible to replace.  \"The SNP government simply cannot be in a position where it has allowed itself to be a facilitator for making skilled workers redundant and replaced with insecure agency work.  \"That is an outrage and SNP Finance Secretary Derek Mackay must immediately address these reports and take swift action to ensure these skills are not lost for good.\"  Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the SNP Government had been \u0026ldquoeasily duped by this company and has now cleared the way for the casualisation of the workforce.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove heard very little from the SNP since they press released saving the yard back in April. BiFab workers are right to feel betrayed.  But a Scottish Government spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe are in regular contact with BiFab \u0026ndash including a meeting between ministers and senior representatives that took place this week.  \u0026ldquoWe have made a long term investment in the company, however we do not participate in operational management decisions.  \u0026ldquoIt was clear at the point new ownership was secured that conditions would remain challenging for the yards and new contracts would have to be won to secure future work.  \u0026ldquoThe workforce played a major role in securing new investment for the yards and the prospect of securing future contracts which DF Barnes is working toward.  \u0026ldquoWe have confidence that everything possible is being done to secure new contracts and restore employment to previous levels."},{"url":null,"title":"sixty-pianos-are-the-key-to-a-playable-fringe-venue","story":"  The Pianodrome, when constructed, will be placed on the Pyrus Lawn at the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh for a series of shows from August 3 to 26 during the Fringe.

Speaking at the city\u0026rsquos Waterfront Hall, she is due to say that any such deal would go against the Good Friday Agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland 20 years ago after decades of conflict.  Mrs May will say that following the publication of the Government\u0026rsquos white paper agreed at Chequers, it is \u0026ldquonow for the EU to respond.  She will add: \u0026ldquoNot simply to fall back on to previous positions which have already been proven unworkable. But to evolve their position in kind.  \u0026ldquoAnd, on that basis, I look forward to resuming constructive discussions.  The EU\u0026rsquos other 27 states will have a chance to examine and respond to the white paper when its General Council of ministers meets in Brussels on Friday morning.  They will also receive an update on negotiations from the European Commission\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.  The Irish border issue is one of the most disputed parts of the Brexit negotiations.  In the event of a hard no-deal Brexit, the EU wants a backstop that would effectively create a border down the Irish Sea between the island of Ireland and Great Britain, something Mrs May has repeatedly opposed.  The UK Government insists that any backstop position should include the UK as a whole.          I enjoyed meeting @MichelBarnier , discussing the progress we have made, and the outstanding issues to resolve across the Withdrawal Agreement and the Future Framework.

Mr Barnier told reporters on Thursday that it was \u0026ldquoa matter of urgency to agree a legally operative backstop, saying: \u0026ldquoWe need an all-weather insurance policy.  Mr Raab said that he was looking forward \u0026ldquowith renewed energy, vigour and vim to seeing the detail of the White Paper hammered out after a gruelling Cabinet conclave at Chequers.  Brexiteer Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom put some pressure on Mrs May\u0026rsquos plan, saying the EU must be told the Chequers blueprint, which has divided the Conservative party, is the \u0026ldquofinal offer rather than an opening gambit.  However she also admitted quitting without an agreement would not be an \u0026ldquooptimal solution.  Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, meanwhile, insisted the deal is \u0026ldquoabsolutely alive despite the Government being forced to make concessions to Brexiteers.  Mrs May will again refuse to countenance any backstop that creates a divide between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.  \u0026ldquoThe economic and constitutional dislocation of a formal \u0026lsquothird country\u0026rsquo customs border within our own country is something I will never accept and I believe no British prime minister could ever accept.  \u0026ldquoAnd as they made clear this week, it is not something the House of Commons will accept either.  As the EU warns member states to increase preparations for no deal, the Prime Minister is also due to insist that an agreement can be reached with Brussels \u0026ldquothat works in our mutual interest.  She will say the deal will put the UK on the way to \u0026ldquoa prosperous future, protecting jobs and boosting prosperity at the same time as honouring the 2016 referendum result, adding: \u0026ldquoI am passionate about that brighter future and the possibilities that are within our grasp.

The public are being encouraged to take part in the Big Butterfly Count over the next three weeks to help experts see how butterflies are faring and to enjoy the mental health benefits of watching wildlife.  The UK has experienced the right combination of a cold winter and a settled late spring and summer so far this year, enabling\u0026nbspspring butterflies to thrive.  The annual count could record a bumper year for species such as holly blue, common white, common blue and red admirals.  But the ongoing hot dry conditions could mean plants wither away and the next generation of caterpillars cannot find the food they need to survive.  Populations of butterflies collapsed as a result of the 1976 drought for this reason,\u0026nbsp wildlife charity Butterfly Conservation said.  The Big Butterfly Count, organised by Butterfly Conservation and sponsored by B\u0026ampQ, asks people to spot and record 17 species of common butterflies and two day-flying moths during three weeks of high summer.  Mental health charity Mind is supporting the Big Butterfly Count as a \u0026ldquowonderful way of interacting with the environment and championing the benefits of spending time in nature, which research shows can help alleviate problems such as depression and anxiety.  And Butterfly Conservation president and veteran broadcaster Sir David has spoken of the mental health benefits of spending time in nature, even at home watching garden wildlife.  \u0026ldquoI have been privileged to have witnessed some truly breath-taking wildlife spectacles in far-flung locations but some of my most memorable experiences have happened when I\u0026rsquove been simply sitting and watching the wildlife that lives where I do, he said.  \u0026ldquoA few precious moments spent watching a stunning red admiral or peacock butterfly feeding amongst the flowers in my garden never fails to bring me great pleasure.  \u0026ldquoSpending time with nature offers us all precious breathing space away from the stresses and strains of modern life, it enables us to experience joy and wonder, to slow down and to appreciate the wildlife that lives side by side with us.  Sir David also said the Big Butterfly Count, which involves spending 15 minutes in a sunny spot counting butterflies and submitting sightings online, can help gather vital information\u0026nbspthat may help protect them in the future.  More than three-quarters of the UK\u0026rsquos butterflies have declined in the last 40 years, with some common species, such as the small tortoiseshell, suffering significant slumps.  Sir David said: \u0026ldquoA cause for great concern over recent years is that many of our once common and widespread species like the large white, small copper and gatekeeper have started to struggle, mirroring the declines of rarer species.  \u0026ldquoButterfly Conservation has also revealed that butterflies are declining faster in our towns and cities than in the countryside.  \u0026ldquoSo please take part in the Big Butterfly Count this summer, we need to know, now, more than ever before, just what is happening to butterflies in our towns, in our gardens and in our countryside."},{"url":null,"title":"appearance-related-stress-rockets-among-young-women-survey-reveals","story":"  More than four in 10 women (42%) aged 16 to 24 have experienced stress related to their appearance this year, up from 26% in 2016, according to a report by analysts Mintel.  Hera Crossan, research analyst at Mintel, said: \u0026ldquoThe constant exposure to unrealistic ideals of beauty is having a strong impact on young women, who increasingly report their physical appearance as a factor of stress and discontent.  \u0026ldquoIt is likely that social media and reality TV shows such as Love Island have helped cultivate an unhealthy obsession with appearance perfection that women feel the need to live up to.  Overall, 91% of 16 to 24-year-olds have experienced stress in the last year compared with 77% of over-55s.  But while stress levels peak among younger consumers, just 4% did nothing to tackle the problem, compared with 23% of over-55s.  The top three sources of stress for Britons are money (41%), work (32%) and physical health problems (25%), the poll found.  Ms Crossan said: \u0026ldquoOver-55s may be less likely to report experiencing stress in the last year than Britain\u0026rsquos youngest adults, and indeed have fewer contributory factors, but the proportion who have been impacted by any stress is still high.  \u0026ldquoWhile cultural changes have meant that under-25s are much more open to talking about their mental health, older consumers are still much more likely to \u0026lsquobottle it up\u0026rsquo, and deal with the problem alone.  She added: \u0026ldquoGrowing financial pressure on the side of the NHS and the continued consumer-driven stigma surrounding the practice have meant that Brits are not getting the mental healthcare they need.  \u0026ldquoVery few adults who experienced stress in the last year spoke to a professional, suggesting that reduced access to medical services could be a hindrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, an increase in app-based support and therapy via video conference could help fill the gap in mental healthcare.

Moe will debut as part of a new strip titled Moe\u0026rsquos Monkey Feet, which will see the character \u0026ldquousing his amazingly dextrous feet to play pranks on other notorious Beano characters.  Walliams, 46, will feature as himself alongside Beano favourites such as the Bash Street Kids and characters from his World\u0026rsquos Worst Children books.  He has also commissioned a BeanoTown adventure, set to feature characters Dennis and his pet dog Gnasher, Minnie the Minx (real name Hermione Makepeace) and superhero parody character Bananaman.  There is also a nod to other character staples from the Dundee-based comic, such as Lord Snooty, Tin-Can Tommy and Pansy Potter.  In his editor\u0026rsquos letter, Walliams said: \u0026ldquoWhat I always loved about the Beano was that it felt naughty. It was a comic that you should read under the duvet with a torchlight. I don\u0026rsquot think I\u0026rsquod have got into writing my books without Beano.  \u0026ldquoWhen coming up with characters for my TV shows and books, I\u0026rsquod imagine them all as larger than life characters, much like the ones in Beano. The comic is quintessentially British and as long as there are children who like to laugh there will always be a place for the Beano.  He added: \u0026ldquoI was thrilled to be invited to guest-edit the Beano, I felt rather giddy sitting in the editor\u0026rsquos chair helping to create storylines and introduce my new character to the comic\u0026rsquos fanbase.  \u0026ldquoAs an official member of the Fan Club, as a child I\u0026rsquod wear my Dennis and Gnasher badges with such pride, so it\u0026rsquos great to hear that it\u0026rsquos making an overdue comeback! All that\u0026rsquos left for me to say is Happy Birthday to the best comic in the world!  Emma Scott, chief executive of Beano Studios, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos fantastic to work with David Walliams for our 80th birthday bash \u0026ndash he\u0026rsquos brilliantly Beano \u0026ndash embodying the daft and rebellious nature which for 80 years has entertained kids and parents alike.  \u0026ldquoOn its 80th birthday, Beano is more relevant than ever, spreading much-needed cheekiness and inspiring kids to just embrace being kids, whether it\u0026rsquos on our award-winning Beano, in our hit TV shows and the world-record breaking comic. Here\u0026rsquos to the next 80 years!  Little Britain star Walliams will appear on the cover of the 44-page special edition in Beano form, with favourites including Dennis and Gnasher, Minnie the Minx, and his own dog, Bert.  He guest edited the comic in exchange for a donation to UK charity YoungMinds, which focuses on the mental health and wellbeing of children and young people.  Beano Studios and YoungMinds also worked together to create a new character called Mandi, who will debut in the 80th birthday issue.

And he indicated the EU was ready to amend its \"backstop\" proposals for the Irish border, which have become the biggest stumbling block in talks.  But the chief negotiator also made clear there were elements of the plan agreed by the Cabinet earlier this month, which the European Commission did not understand, and said further discussions would be needed over the coming weeks to establish how much \"common ground\" exists between London and Brussels.  Mrs May\u0027s proposal for a \"facilitated customs arrangement\" opened up the risk of major fraud, additional bureaucracy and damage to EU businesses, he claimed.  Mr Barnier was speaking shortly after the PM issued a challenge to Brussels to \"evolve\" its negotiating position in response to the publication of her Brexit blueprint.  He said the EU had always been \"creative and flexible\" in its approach to negotiations.  But he insisted that future talks would be based on the guidelines issued by the European Council in March - which included the controversial proposal to keep Northern Ireland in the EU customs union - and not on Mrs May\u0027s document.  \"There will be a deal if there is an agreement on the backstop,\" declared Mr Barnier.  \"It\u0027s not necessarily our backstop. We can work on this, amend it, improve our backstop - the one that the Commission proposed on behalf of the Union.  \"Technically we feel that it\u0027s workable, we can improve it further, we can work on it. We are doing that work.  \"But we need an operational backstop now, in the Withdrawal Agreement, and not later.\"  In her first major Brexit speech since the wave of ministerial resignations which followed her Chequers deal, Mrs May described the White Paper proposals as \"a significant development of our position...a coherent package\".  And she said: \"It is now for the EU to respond - not simply to fall back on to previous positions which have already been proven unworkable, but to evolve their position in kind.  \"And, on that basis, I look forward to resuming constructive discussions.\"  Speaking in Belfast, the PM also took aim at critics from the hard Brexit wing of the Conservative Party, accusing them of being ready to \"betray\" the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic.  She took on the argument of prominent Eurosceptics including Jacob Rees-Mogg, who say the UK should simply declare it will impose no checks on its side of the Irish border and leave it to Brussels to decide whether to require the Republic to erect barriers on the other.  \"The protection of the peace process and upholding our binding commitments in the Belfast Agreement are grave responsibilities,\" she said.  \"Not to seek a solution would be to resume our career as an independent sovereign trading nation by betraying commitments to a part of our nation and to our nearest neighbour.\"  And she took a swipe at former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson\u0027s claim - repeated in his resignation speech to the Commons on Wednesday - that technological solutions could be used to avoid the need for infrastructure at the border.  \"No technology solution to address these issues has been designed yet or implemented anywhere in the world, let alone in such a unique and highly sensitive context as the Northern Ireland border,\" she said.  Mrs May restated her implacable opposition to the EU backstop, which she said would involve the creation of a customs border within the UK, which was \"something I will never accept and I believe no British prime minister could ever accept\".  Equally, she said that a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic was \"almost inconceivable\".  Twenty years after the Good Friday Agreement, the return of any form of physical checkpoints or other infrastructure would be \"an alien concept\".  The PM said that her White Paper proposals, which would see the UK remain within the single market for goods and adopt a \"common rule book\" of regulations with the EU, represented a \"credible third option\" that would \"honour the Belfast Agreement, deliver on the referendum result and be good for our economy\".  In Brussels, Mr Barnier pointed out the Withdrawal Agreement could not be concluded without a legally binding backstop setting out the fall-back arrangements if a wider solution for the Irish border could not be found.  This, he stressed, would be based on the Commission\u0027s proposal but \"not necessarily\" stick precisely to the outline released in March."},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeenshire economy buzzing with activity","story":"        A range of local business developments which demonstrate the strengths of the area\u0026#8217s economy have been welcomed by Aberdeenshire Council, as a new economic action plan for the area is introduced to reflect a more positive economic outlook.                Named as Fishing News 2017 ‘Port of the Year’ Peterhead Port handled a record £195million worth of fish during 2017. The port is currently undergoing a £51 million investment and opened the UK’s biggest fish market in June, landing a huge sale of 5,990 boxes on opening day.

The battery capacity is the equivalent of more than 128,000 iPhones.As the wind isn’t always blowing, energy storage technologies like batteries are expected to become increasingly important to secure grid stability as renewable energy becomes ever more significant.And in agriculture, the council’s Garioch Area Committee recently approved planning permission for an expansion of Thainstone Mart, supporting an application designed to assist the local industry’s long term future.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Friday 20 Jul 2018 9:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New record set for Lands End to John OGroats cycle run","story":"THE record for cycling from Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats has been broken by Michael Broadwith.The 40-year-old from Hertfordshire did the marathon bike run in 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds \u0026ndash more than 30 minutes faster than the previous record held by Gethin Butler.His record of 44 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds had stood for 17 years.Veteran local cyclist Alasdair Washington was a record-keeper for the Road Records Association (RRA) at the north end of the trip.Mr Broadwith, a maths teacher, joins a select number of people to break the record since George Mills, riding a penny-farthing, made the first successful end-to-end attempt in 1886.Broadwith also broke the RRA 24-hour record with 507.511 miles covered at an average speed of 21.1 miles per hour.Bill Mowat, vice-chairman of the Dunnet and Canisbay Community Council, congratulated Mr Broadwith on his remarkable achievement.The women\u0026rsquos record holder is Lynne Taylor who lives in the West Midlands. \u0026ldquoShe is the only one with a Canisbay parish relative to do so, said Mr Mowat, who pointed out that the RRA only recognised female racers in the late 1930s.

This means 42 per cent of all eligible LFASS 2017 claims have now been paid, with more payments to follow in the coming weeks.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Given the pressures that farmers and crofters continue to face, due in part to the extreme weather conditions during the winter and summer periods, I’m glad to see these important payments starting two months earlier than last year.“Earlier in the year we provided a loan option for farmers in advance of these payments, to help provide cashflow and financial certainty. Farmers are the backbone of Scotland’s rural economy and the Scottish Government is committed to supporting them wherever possible.\u0026#8221On behalf of the Scottish Farmers Union, NFU Scotland, LFA Committee Chairman, Robert Macdonald, welcomed the news saying: “The news that LFASS payments will be reaching farmers and crofters is welcome, particularly for those who did not apply for or receive an LFASS loan of 90 per cent through the LFASS loan scheme. The current prolonged period of extraordinary weather, and the economic impact that it brings, once again underlines the importance of these payments to business stability.“As we look ahead its vital that support for the less favoured areas, for hill farms and crofts, continues. NFU Scotland continues to press the Scottish Government for a timetable for payments, delivered in a timely manner to allow farmers and crofters to efficiently plan their cashflow.“Whilst these payments will bring relief for some, NFUS continues to highlight to farmers and crofters the importance of planning ahead for straw and feed supplies with three key messages — Plan ahead, Be flexible and collaborate.”\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We created the FitHomes concept to help Highland residents take charge of their own wellbeing and health needs through innovative technology and design.\"Thanks to the support we\u0026rsquove had from Centrica, both financially and advisory, we will be able to deliver digital health and assisted living technologies in a way that has not been possible before.\"The investment has been made by Centrica\u0026rsquos Ignite social impact investment fund. Established in 2017, Centrica Innovations aims to invest \u0026pound100 million by 2022 in new technologies that will transform the way people live, work and move.Sam Salisbury, Centrica Innovations labs director, said: \"As a market leader in connected home products, we are always on the lookout for opportunities to solve real world problems with new technology and innovation. The lack of affordable, energy efficient, desirable homes is one that is affecting families across the country so we\u0026rsquore delighted to be able to support an initiative that shows such potential in transforming how people, young and old, live in their homes.\"The origins of the FitHome go back to 2008 when a tenant was found dead in his home, having lain unnoticed for over a year. Vowing to put new preventative systems in place, Albyn commissioned research exploring potential solutions. As a result, the society decided to develop its own system that could be adopted across its growing portfolio of homes.Matt Stevenson of Carbon Dynamic said of FitHomes: \"I truly believe that this housing method can change the way that we view construction of new housing developments as well as feeding into the wider healthcare and societal issues.\"Friday 20 Jul 2018 9:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

As a result, Newton Road will be closed from July 19 at 7am to July 22 at 11am. And Dingwall No.1 in Craig Road will be shut from 7am on August 2 to 11am on August 5.Final installation and testing of the new barriers will also require fortnight-long road closures at both sites \u0026ndash Dingwall Middle from October 15 to 29 and Dingwall No.1 from October 29 to November 12.David Dickson, infrastructure director for Network Rail Scotland, said: \"These level crossing upgrades represent a significant improvement for rail and road safety.\"Our consultation work with the local community earlier this year indicated support for these improvements and we look forward to seeing them delivered.\"Our aim is to deliver this work with as little disruption as possible, however, we will require two short closures this summer plus two week road closures for each crossing to install and test the new equipment this autumn.\"Train services are not expected to be affected by any of the works.Friday 20 Jul 2018 9:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Visitors will then be able to access behind the scenes areas of the museum, experiencing objects up close.Curator Dr Karen Buchanan explained: \"We want to make as much of the material in our collections accessible as possible. This includes not only our objects in storage, but also the wealth of archive and library material we hold, which document the history of Gairloch parish. This funding will maximise our storage space, protect our collection for the future and enrich our visitors\u0026rsquo experiences.\"Museums Galleries Scotland is the National Development Body for museums and galleries in Scotland and offers strategic development support to the sector.

A spokesperson for the judges said:\"He is someone who thoroughly deserves to be recognised for the great contribution he has made to both the industry and the community. A wonderful role model and ambassador.\"Stories shared by his colleagues when nominating him, included times when he dug out roads during a storm to deliver bottled gas and a generator to a terminally-ill customer delivering flowers to a customer who had recently lost her husband, and caring for a customer who had suffered a severe stroke.\"For me, it isn\u0026rsquot about going above and beyond, it\u0026rsquos about doing what I feel is the right thing to do and making sure our customers are cared for and supported when they need us most,\" said a modest Mr Sutherland, who said the award was as much recognition for the Highland team as for himself. \"I\u0026rsquom delighted to take this award home to my wife and girls, who have supported me along the way as I disappeared for days during storms, sometimes missing important events and occasions at home. It\u0026rsquos all worth it as I\u0026rsquom glad to say I still love my job as much as I did when I joined 44 years ago as an apprentice.\"Colin Pirie, SSEN\u0026rsquos head of Region for the Highlands and Islands, added: \"Mike is without doubt the most dedicated, conscientious person I have ever met in my 28 years with SSEN.\"He genuinely cares for everyone he meets. His selfless attitude and his devotion to customers, colleagues (especially young people and trainees) and his family is well known. He is an example to us all.\"Mike is a great colleague but more importantly a great friend to all of us in the Highlands.\"Since their launch of the Utility Week Stars Awards in 2014, the annual event has grown to become the de facto celebration of dedication, ingenuity and teamwork in the UK utilities sector.SSEN picked up another gong, as the SSEN Safety, Health and Environment team won the Health and Safety Initiative award for the roll-out of an influencing behaviours training programme and safety licence across the division.Friday 20 Jul 2018 9:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Depute fiscal Alison McKenzie told Sheriff Margaret Neilson the 15-year-old was being trained in lifeguard skills and it was when they were alone at the pool Russell repeatedly fondled him over his trunks: \"It happened so frequently he could not recall the number of occasions he was molested,\" said the fiscal.The boy didn\u0026rsquot report the assaults and told no-one until many years later as a father of two he received a letter from Russell offering to act as a football scout for his children.The fiscal said: \"The complainer was furious, recalled the abuse he suffered at the hands of the accused, and made a statement of complaint to police.\"Russell admitted assaulting the boy on various dates between 1977 and 1979 at Dingwall Sports Centre Swimming Pool and between May and June 1981 at the Mackay Hostel sexually assaulting a 16-year-old.He further admitted assaulting an 18-year-old by handling his buttocks over his kilt in 1983 at a street in Dingwall and exposing himself to him.He also pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting an 18- year-old at the hostel in 1984 by sitting on his bed uninvited, placing his hand under the bed covers and repeatedly attempting to touch his genitals.Sentence was deferred after his last appearance for reports.Russell is due to appear in court again on August 2.Friday 20 Jul 2018 9:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In more recent times, it has seen the fairytale rise of Ross County from Highland League to Premiership \u0026ndash and a notorious Town Hall appearance by the Beatles when the Fab Four were on the brink of global success.Now, history hunters are being targeted by DCDC which has sought to work with the public to create a new vision of the town.Fascinating facts are being assembled by Dingwall History Society for panels dotting the town and shining light on its rich past.Secretary\u0026nbspSandra MacDonald said: \"Dingwall has a very long and significant history and we have the information available.\"The group will gather facts and suggest significant sites worthy of interpretation but will not have the final say.Mrs MacDonald, whose late husband David \"DD\" MacDonald chaired the society for a decade, said: \"There are the obvious sites like the Tollbooth \u0026ndash the tower and the clock.\"Other sites being considered include the war memorials at Station Square and the Hector Macdonald Monument and Moot Hill in the Cromartie Memorial car park, where the Vikings are believed to have held gatherings.Mrs MacDonald added: \"A board can carry a minimum amount of information but can indicate where people can access far more online.\"DCDC secretary Robin Lingard revealed the heritage trail is one of several items being proposed by the group, set up as a charity two years ago to tap funding pots for improvements. He told a recent open meeting that membership had more than doubled. \"We are very pleased,\" he said. \"I think out of it new ideas will come forward.\"Community activist George Murray, project manager for Dingwall Means Business, targeting the establishment of a business improvement district (BID), said: \"I think the DCDC is the perfect body to spearhead and develop plans like the heritage trail. I see it as being beneficial not only for local community development and participation but also as a way of presenting our community heritage to the world, especially as we get busier with the advent of the cruise tour coaches beginning to discover the town and the success of the NC500 route.\"If suitable funding can be put in place a heritage trail round the area could be a real boon to the town.\"Dingwall councillor Angela MacLean said a trail is \"a fantastic opportunity\" to showcase the town.She said: \"Many of the DCDC group\u0026rsquos wish list buildings are in the ownership of the Highland Council and if DCDC or another local group would like to take over and run of any of these buildings I am more than happy to lend my support. I would also like to congratulate DCDC for the work they have done so far and look forward to working with them to make some of their proposals a reality over the coming years.\"\u0026bull What do you think about the idea?

The Oil \u0026amp Gas Technology Centre (OGTC) is leading the industry-backed “Facility of the Future” initiative that could halve the cost of developing and operating an oil and gas facility and help to access the equivalent of more than 3.5 billion barrels of reserves in so-called marginal discoveries.            A discovery is classed as marginal when the risks or technology involved make it too challenging to develop economically, for instance because of its geographical location or the specialist equipment needed.            The project wants to design a new approach that will make this process more efficient than traditional methods, such as fixed platforms.It aims to develop lower-cost, reusable facilities that can be remotely operated from onshore control centres, thereby increasing reducing the requirement for staff to work in the hazardous offshore environment and creating skilled onshore jobs. Chris Pearson, the OGTC’s small pools solution centre manager, said: “Oil and gas is playing catch-up with many industries when it comes to automation and remote operations. We’re exploring how the combination of existing and new technology can be best used in the offshore environment to improve safety, reduce life cycle cost and increase efficiency.“New, smarter and more automated ways of developing oil and gas fields are required if we’re to fully unlock marginal discoveries and maximise economic recovery from the UKCS. “The Facility of the Future initiative will help to significantly reduce life-cycle costs and strengthen the investment case for both marginal discoveries and more traditional reservoirs.”            The initiative will kick off with a study led by Crondall Energy and Buoyant Production Technologies to develop a floating facility adapted from the type of installations currently used for shallow water gas fields, known as NUIs, to make them suitable for oil discoveries. It hopes to design an NUI concept that will function at any water depth and uses a minimal manning approach by involving remote control and automation technologies.Niki Chambers, project manager at the marginal development solutions centre, said: “This study is looking at unlocking the capabilities of these floating facilities to work across any kind of discovery. It is opening up the whole of the UKCS.” The OGTC is supported by the Scottish and UK governments, Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire councils and Opportunity North East. It also generates funding from industry and university partners, and is currently in the process of securing further funds for subsequent studies as part of this initiative."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4770822.1531988489!/image/image.jpg","title":"business stream looking to make waves with sales and marketing director","story":"        Water supplier Business Stream has hired a sales and marketing director from a rival business.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4771365.1532074989!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment mps are nothing without honour","story":"        Pressure caused by Brexit is showing alarming signs of damaging our democratic process.                The pressure exerted by Brexit on our politicians has been considerable.             Since the Chequers plan was announced, there has been talk that Theresa May will face a leadership challenge, that a snap general election is on the cards, and even that parties could split and reform along new political lines. And the stakes could hardly be higher with the country apparently on course for a no-deal Brexit which could wreck the UK economy.             But yesterday brought accusations which, if true, suggests our democratic system itself could be starting to crack under the strain.There were claims of a “calculated, deliberate breaking of trust”, calls for the resignation of the Government’s chief whip Julian Smith and the Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis, and a note of despair from Tory MP Heidi Alexander, who said: “No matter how tough the going gets, principle, integrity and standards matter. Without those, what’s left?”READ MORE: EU states to be warned over possible no-deal BrexitThe affair began when it emerged Lewis had taken part in a close Commons vote on Brexit, which the Government won by a few votes, even though he had agreed not to vote as part of a ‘pairing’ deal with Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson, who is on maternity leave. Theresa May explained to the Commons that this had been a simple mistake, but reports have since emerged that two other Tory MPs were told to break their pairing agreements. A text to one MP from Smith was described as “an order, not a request”. However, to their credit, the two MPs both refused to comply and stuck by the pairing agreement. The reports have not been denied, but May was said to be sticking by Smith.            The SNP, among others, called for an inquiry into what happened and, if one were to be held, May would doubtless be asked whether she had given instructions to the chief whip to tell MPs to break pairing agreements or if she had tacitly agreed to such a dishonourably strategy. She would also face questions about whether she misled the House by saying there had been a mistake. But, with no evidence that the Prime Minister was actually involved, the focus for now will be on Smith and Lewis. Conservative MP Anna Soubry, a shining voice of reason in this fractious House, summed the situation up as eloquently as ever: “If true, this is appalling and those responsible must resign. If we cannot behave with honour we are nothing.”READ MORE: Theresa May steps back from the brink with narrow Brexit victory"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772007.1532114342!/image/image.jpg","title":"stay informed top 10 opinions of the week","story":"        The Scotsman is publishing a selection of its best opinion articles from the previous seven days to showcase some of the most insightful writing in Scottish journalism.                Ruth Davidson’s barnstorming attack on Donald Trump created headlines in other newspapers after she accused the US President of “desperate – and dangerous – sycophancy” towards Vladimir Putin.            “Nothing attracted a wannabe strong man, it seems, than thuggish strength,” she wrote, adding that Putin’s regime was “contemptuous of international law and our democratic way of life”.             But she said Trump would not bring about the end of Western democracy as we know it because those fighting to preserve our hard-earned freedoms would ultimately prevail.READ MORE: Ruth Davidson: Putin-sycophant Trump will never destroy Western democracyLesley Riddoch also had a thing or two to say about Trump, saying reports that he “totally hates” First Minister Nicola Sturgeon were essentially a feather in her cap.“Whether the head of state is North Korea’s Kim Jong Un or Germany’s Angela Merkel, [Trump] flatters and insults by turn, aiming to destabilise rivals in the run-up to important trade talks. But hate? That’s an emotion largely reserved for his own former members of staff ... and now it seems the First Minister. That’s no mean feat.”By taking part in Scotland’s largest gay pride march in Glasgow during Trump’s visit, Sturgeon delivered an “indirect rebuke” to the US president as this allowed her to “contrast a society which ‘champions equality and fairness at all times’ with Trump’s America where transgender people are banned from the US military and LGBTI content has been removed from US government websites, including an apology to gay people persecuted in the 1950s and 60s”.

I’ve lied to people to preserve a false self-image. I’ve mistreated those I love, whether family, friends or partners in relationships. I’ve engaged in ‘locker-room banter’ and co-signed misogynistic and racist ‘jokes’. For me to get up on stage and pretend I’m some paragon of virtue would be to engage in the very hubristic nonsense for which ‘The Donald’ is infamous.“I did all those things, without a modicum of self-awareness, because the ego I constructed to fortify my demoralising insecurities was so huge that when it came time to hear a bit of sobering truth, I was ill-equipped to take incoming calls.

The Aberdeen South MP had attacked Theresa May’s Brexit plan, claiming it would turn the UK into a “vassal state”, and praised Boris Johnson and David Davis for “standing by their principles” and resigning from the Cabinet.             McLellan suggested this appeared to be “a pitch to be Scotland Secretary in PM Bojo’s Barmy Cabinet”. He pointed to a different take on Johnson’s character by Max Hastings, the ex-editor of the Daily , who wrote that it was a “common mistake to suppose Johnson a nice man ... he is a man of remarkable gifts, flawed by an absence of conscience, principle or scruple”.“The aim for Team May, if I may be so bold, should be to get Brexit over the line, and the word from people a lot closer to this than me beyond the Conservative Party is that the key principles laid out in the Chequers blueprint, like customs alignment for manufactured goods and the end of free movement, are very close to doing just that.”READ MORE: John McLellan: Bojo’s Barmy Army is polishing a t**dBrian Monteith, however, took a rather different stance. The public were being “taken for fools by the Prime Minister”, he wrote. \u2028“There are only two viable positions for our country, or indeed any country: being fully in the European Union or being fully out. Anything else is a self-deceiving construct that in time brings servitude to what the EU wants,” he argued.“May has failed to make Brexit mean Brexit.

Susan Dalgety, on an epic clockwise trip around the entire mainland United States, arrived in New Orleans, a city that has an unusual attitude towards death. The Museum of Death warns visitors to prepare themselves as there have been a number of what it calls “falling down ovations” – people fainting. After recovering from the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, the city has returned to being a place famed for its non-stop party atmosphere. “At four in the afternoon, the party was in full swing. James, squeezed into a silver, sequinned jacket three sizes too small, was drinking Bud from a champagne flute, while handing out stuffed toys from a large bag under his seat. ‘He always does that, he’s got a big heart,’ explained Cordell, who came back from the bathroom with a penguin,” wrote Dalgety in the latest instalment of what is a wonderful series of reports.READ MORE: Susan Dalgety: The party city where only musicians keep timeAdmitting this might be seen as “heresy” by some, Kenny MacAskill, Scotland’s former Justice Secretary, called for fellow Nationalists to push for a second Brexit referendum, which he was confident would be won by the Remain camp, before another one on independence.“The political circumstances of Brexit aren’t good for the independence cause and most certainly not a hard Brexit ... An implosion of the economy and collapse in living standards aren’t the best circumstances for a confident people to vote for independence. Suggestions that Scots will see no alternative to leaving the UK are offset by worries that when things are grim they ‘hold on to nurse for fear of something worse’. I’ve never believed that the worse it gets the more folk are likely to vote for independence. No! Sorry, the worse it gets, heads go down and hope fades!” he argued.READ MORE: Kenny MacAskill: Nationalists must push for Brexitref 2 before Indyref 2Bill Jamieson had a fairly scary warning for the BBC – that it could cease to exist as we know it within five to ten years. The rise of Netflix, Amazon Prime and other global giants of entertainment posed an existential threat to Aunty Beeb, he claimed, while bemoaning the number of repeats.“The BBC’s ... authority has all but gone. Broadcast rivals are no longer reliant on advertising for their income but can raise massive amounts by subscription. The BBC and its £150.50-a-year license fee system has wilted under the assault. It still has the capacity to create stunning and opinion-changing programmes such as Blue Planet, and mount great documentaries and prize-winning historical drama.

With just months until Britain leaves the EU, political differences on the terms of Brexit are still rife and Scotland remains at odds with Westminster over the terms of any deal.                The UK faces crashing out without a deal if the bloc rejects its plans.             In fact, hardcore Brexiteers in Conservative ranks are increasingly saying a “no deal” Brexit would be better than a soft Brexit.             So possible is the outcome that both the UK and the EU have issued guidance on their preparations for a no deal scenario.READ MORE: Scotland’s Brexit battle with UK backed by Northern Ireland and WalesREAD MORE: Joyce McMillan: New political alliances vital to stop Brexit disasterWhat is a ‘no deal’ Brexit? A “no deal” Brexit does what it says on the tin. It means the UK and the EU would be unable to reach a withdrawal agreement.             If no agreement can be made, it means there would be no 21-month transition period, which Theresa May is currently proposing. If that was the case, consumers, businesses and public bodies would have to respond immediately to changes as result of leaving the EU.  “On 29 March next year, the UK would leave the EU and everything associated with that would come to an end,” says Dr Simon Usherwood, a reader in politics at the University of Surrey. “[A no deal] doesn’t stop the UK leaving but it means there is absolutely no clarity about what happens.”             While it is a possibility, in reality neither the UK nor the EU would favour a no deal because it signals a poor political relationship, he adds. One of the key issues with a no deal scenario is the uncertainty it would lead to for life and work in Britain.So what would actually happen with no deal? Trade The UK would revert to World Trade Organisation rules on trade.             While Britain would no longer be bound by EU rules, it would have to face the EU’s external tariffs. The price of goods in shops for Britons could go up as businesses would have to place tariffs on goods imported from the EU. Some British-made products may be rejected by the EU as new authorisation and certification might be required. Manufacturers could move their operations to the EU to avoid delays in components coming across the border. People The UK would be free to set its own controls on immigration by EU nationals and the bloc could do the same for Britons. There could be long delays at borders if passport and customs checks are heightened.  The fate of expats – there are 1.3 million Britons in EU countries and 3.7 million Europeans in Britain – in terms of their rights to live and work would be unclear. Professionals working in the EU might find their qualifications are no longer recognised, meaning they are no longer able to practice. Flights to the EU could be grounded as the necessary safety confirmations to cover both ends of the journey might not be in place. Laws Relevant EU laws would be transferred over so there would be no black holes in Britain’s lawbook. Britain would no longer have to adhere to the rulings of the European Court of Justice but it would be bound to the European Court of Human Rights, a non-EU body. Money The Government would not have to pay the annual £13 billion contribution to the EU budget. However Britain would lose out on some EU subsidies – the Common Agricultural Policy gives £3 billion to farmers. The Irish border The issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic would remain unresolved. While physical infrastructure has been vetoed, the border would become an external frontier for the EU in the event of a no deal Brexit. There would be pressure to enforce customs and immigration controls.Would UK be able to broker trade agreements with other countries? The current deal on the table would allow Britain to start trade negotiations with other countries after 29 March 2019 but any deals would not be implemented until after the transition period of 21 months. With a no deal, Britain could implement the deals whenever the fine print is ready. But deals take years, not months or weeks, to broker. Therefore the UK is not gaining anything by having no transition period in this instance. “It’s worth making the point that trade deals are about agreements with states. If the UK left without a deal showing it was unable to have constructive conversations with close trading partners [the EU], it would not be a great incentive for third parties,” says Dr Usherwood.This story first featured on our sister site the i."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772027.1532118789!/image/image.jpg","title":"theresa may s brexit plans questioned by eu chief barnier","story":"        The EU\u0026#8217s chief Brexit negotiator has questioned whether the Prime Minister Theresa May\u0026#8217s proposals for customs arrangements are workable, in his first public response to last week\u0026#8217s white paper.                Speaking after briefing ministers from the 27 remaining EU states in Brussels yesterday, Michel Barnier said the white paper has opened the way for “constructive discussions” on the post-Brexit relationship between the EU and the UK.            He indicated the EU was ready to amend its “backstop” proposals for the Irish border, which have become the biggest stumbling block in talks.            He said there were elements of the plan agreed by the Cabinet earlier this month at Chequers which the European Commission did not understand, and said further discussions would be needed over the coming weeks to establish how much “common ground” exists between London and Brussels.Mrs May’s proposal for a “facilitated customs arrangement” opened up the risk of major fraud, additional bureaucracy and damage to EU businesses, he said.Tory arch-Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg said Mr Barnier’s “aggressive” comments “show why we are right to be leaving the mafia-like European Union”.Mr Barnier was speaking shortly after Mrs May issued a challenge to Brussels to “evolve” its negotiating position in response to the publication of her Brexit blueprint.In her first major Brexit speech since the wave of ministerial resignations which followed her Chequers deal, the Prime Minister described the proposals as “a significant development of our position … a coherent package”.            And she said: “It is now for the EU to respond – not simply to fall back on to previous positions which have already been proven unworkable, but to evolve their position in kind.“And, on that basis, I look forward to resuming constructive discussions.”Speaking in Belfast, Mrs May also took aim at critics from the hard Brexit wing of the Conservative Party, accusing them of being ready to “betray” the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic.She took on the argument of prominent Eurosceptics including Jacob Rees-Mogg, who say the UK should simply declare it will impose no checks on its side of the Irish border and leave it to Brussels to decide whether to require the Republic to erect barriers on the other. Mrs May restated her implacable opposition to the EU backstop, which she said would involve the creation of a customs border within the UK, which was “something I will never accept”."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre.

The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building.

If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.

And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers.

One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16?

And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed.

It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another.

They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations. Rescheduling appointments is not easy for those living in remote communities and patients may have a lengthy wait for another opportunity to travel.\n\u0026#8220The right to strike is an important one and I understand that strikes have to cause disruption in order to be effective.\n\u0026#8220But, I urge your members to carefully consider this compromise: Loganair flights from the North Isles use smaller aircraft which require a lower level of fire service cover.\n\u0026#8220Therefore, Unite members could guarantee a minimum level of fire and security coverage on the proposed strike dates, allowing life-line Orkney and Shetland flights to continue for essential medical travel.\n\u0026#8220I hope further discussions will resolve the dispute before any strike action goes ahead and that the needs of North Isles passengers are at the forefront of your decision making.\u0026#8221\nMeanwhile, Loganair is giving passengers in Shetland the chance to change their flights.\nAbout 170 members, including key airport staff, security workers and firefighters have voted in favour of striking – with more talks expected next week involving conciliation service Acas.\nTwenty-four-hour strikes are planned for Friday 20th July as well as on Thursday 2nd August and Thursday16th August.\nLoganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said passengers could change their flights free of charge.\nHe said: “Although there is still time for the strike to be averted and we hope it will be, we are offering customers booked to fly to or from Aberdeen on the strike dates the opportunity to change their travel date or route if they wish.\n\u0026#8220This is free of charge and designed to offer certainty of alternatives for those booked to travel.\n\u0026#8220We also have contingency plans to operate Aberdeen flights to alternate airports on strike days if this does go ahead, and will announce details of those if this action cannot be averted. Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney. It is reasonable to suspect that the SNP is in the unions’ pockets.\nI can only suggest that if Christopher wants to find out who is in the ‘unions pockets’ he should investigate the connection between the Labour Party and Unite,  and while he’s at it perhaps he should refresh his memory as to what powers are reserved at Westminster and which are devolved to Holyrood.\nThere are so many reds under beds these days \u0026#8230\n My primary concern is that Shetland and Orkney folk will be at risk for a number of August days while this irresponsible union strikes.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"vacancy kitchen assistant and dispatch assistant with sandwick baking co ","story":" We currently have a vacancy in our kitchen department assisting in making our range of filled products and also selected confectionery lines.\n We also have a vacancy in our dispatch department wrapping, labelling products and making up customers orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with 14 women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday.\n issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league.

The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one.

We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Campbell-Stewart-MacLennan-Co.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

disturbances that have occurred in the city\u0027s Bogside area in recent nights. \nA rally in solidarity with the local community will be held in the city tonight at 7pm, supported by a range of parties and organisations, at Fahan Street/Butcher Gate. \nIt follows several nights of disturbances in the area which included a gun attack on PSNI officers, several blast bombs and dozens of petrol

people of the Bogside and Fountain and to send a clear message that there is no support for the violence witnessed over the last week. \nMary Lou McDonald made the comments in the Bogside this

She was devoted to the needs of the less fortunate in Romania.  Both her and Samuel travelled many times to Romania thus allowing Barbara to speak passionately at home in Northern Ireland at many events and meetings. At the same time Barbara was busy fundraising, filling and organising containers to be transported out to Romania with all kinds of essential supplies and gifts and was still finding time to help Samuel on their farm.\n\nBarbara inspired many others in the community to travel out to Romania to help the people there in any way they could and see for themselves the need that Barbara so passionately spoke of back home.\n\nBarbara was a people’s person and this was certainly borne out by the large attendance at her funeral at Toberdoney Presbyterian Church last Monday and all those who paid their fitting tributes having travelled from near and far.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBarbara’s passing has left a huge void for her husband Samuel, her father Jim, brother Robin and sister Alison, nephews, nieces, wider family and all who knew her.

I do recognise how serious a mistake it was. \n\nAs a member of parliament I know I have personal responsibility to seek to be above reproach.

I am disappointed that I was not able to persuade members of the committee of the weight of my arguments on some of the major matters of mitigation, especially on the issue of paid advocacy.\n\nHowever, I accept the report, but I do so regret its sanctions. \n\n I have apologised to the House and to colleagues and I understand that subject to the decision of this house I may from September be subject to a suspension lasting 30 days.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nI take my duties, Mr Speaker, as member of parliament seriously.

Especially how it is portrayed.\n\nIt is to my constituents who have sent me here since 2010 that I make the profoundest of all apologies.\n\nThey have honoured me with unwavering support to be their voice and I hope they will continue to have that confidence in me in the future.\n\nMr Speaker, we all in this chamber know that in public life if you make mistakes they are amplified and rightly so. \n\nThat is the nature of the job all of us do and all of us understand.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBut I believe in a politics and I believe in politicians that can admit human frailty, that can apologise, can mean it and can move on - because that’s what real life is all about.\n\nIt’s often said it’s how we respond to these challenges in our lives that defines who and what we are, and defines our character and demonstrates to us where the true source of our personal strength rests.\n\nThe eighth-century prophet Isaiah said: ‘You were angry with me, that anger has turned away, you comfort me.’\n\nI hope to learn that lesson.\n            \n    \n    try { _402_Show() } catch(e) {}    \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_866291.jpg--.jpg?1531813262000\n","title":"ballymena gets in frame with new dementia project","story":"  \nBALLYMENA will be in the frame over the summer months as a new group of friends get out and about together as part of an exciting new walking and photography group. \n  \nDoury Road Youth Group and Alzheimer’s Society are just two of the 30 groups which have been partnered in the ‘Peacing Ages Together’ PEACE IV project.\n  \nThe project has been supported through the European Union’s PEACE IV Programme, managed by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB).\n  \nThis intergenerational partnership is the first to meet out of 15 cross-community partnerships created by MEAAP, and they plan to visit local beauty spots over the summer, for walks and photography sessions.\n  \nThese will then form an arts project they will take part in together in September.\n  \nTwelve older people who live with dementia will meet up with 12 young people and spend 10 sessions together having fun and making new friends over the next few months.\n  \nMEAAP Peace IV Project Officer Sarah McLaughlin said: “This is an amazing opportunity for young people to build their awareness of dementia and take part in fun activities with older people who have so many experiences to share.\n  \n“The ‘Peacing Ages Together’ project is all about tackling loneliness and building friendships between people who may not normally get the chance to meet in everyday life. \n  \n“We have 14 more partnerships just like this one who are meeting for the first time and getting to enjoy new adventures together through 2018/2019.\n  \n“We are supporting each partnership to participate in 10 fun activity sessions ranging from circus skills workshops to cooking food from around the world.
