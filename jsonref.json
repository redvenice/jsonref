It also includes people who the service has been able to contact but who refused to hand over details of their contacts. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that people had a \u0027civic duty\u0027 to work with the NHS Test and Trace system, describing it as the \u0027radar\u0027 for tracking coronavirus.At the Downing Street press conference on Thursday he said the system would continue to improve and he was \u0027confident it will be world class\u0027.Mr Hancock said: \u0027Testing for the virus and tracing how it spreads is critical for containing it locally, so that we can ease the national lockdown.\u0027It\u0027s by isolating the virus that we can control it and we can stop it spreading through our communities.\u0027In this plan to lift lockdown, test and trace is our radar, if you like, it helps us identify where the virus is and trace how it is spreading through the community.\u0027 Contact tracers try 10 times to reach someone in the first 24 hours after they have been referred to the service, attempting to get through to them by email, phone and text. Of those people who were reached and asked to provide information about their contacts, just over three-quarters (79 per cent) were contacted within 24 hours of their case being transferred to the Test and Trace system. Some 14 per cent were contacted between 24 and 48 hours, three per cent between 48 and 72 hours, and four per cent were contacted after 72 hours. Finding people fast is vital for the system to work because the plan is for it to find potentially-infected people before they start to show symptoms and pass the virus on to other people.Jonathan Ashworth, Labour\u0027s Shadow Health Secretary, said: \u0027Tracing is vital to the safe easing of lockdown. \u0027Though this is early data, Matt Hancock needs to explain why a third of people don’t appear to have been contacted and what action they will take to rectify this.\u0027Professor Keith Neal, an epidemiologist at the University of Nottingham, said: \u0027Being unable to contact 33 per cent of diagnosed cases is a concern particularly as a mobile number is involved in requesting the test. \u0027Some of these are part of other investigations including those related to care facilities – this data should be obtainable and identifiable. Nearly 80 per cent of those reached were contacted in a timely manner.\u0027An absolutely crucial part of the test and trace system is the public committing to it – the system can not work without the public’s involvement.\u0027Baroness Harding — who was chief executive of TalkTalk when it was rocked by a huge cyber attack in 2015 — admitted the system was not yet where she wanted it to be. She said: \u0027We are not at the gold standard yet that we want to be, of isolating all contacts within 48 hours of someone requesting a test. But you can absolutely see the path of how we are going to get there.\u0027News, sport and opinion from the Guardian\u0027s UK edition | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Grumpy looking blue tit scowling peers bird box Lincolnshire","story":"Share this article While blue tits typically come in many colours, this specimen seems to be mostly yellow with distinctive brown shading around the eyes.The birds are known to join up in large flocks during winter to search for food, though they are seen all year round. A garden that has four or five blue tits at a feeder could be feeding more than 20 of the birds, according to the RSPB.  They mainly eat insects, caterpillars, seeds and nuts.A blue tit weighs around 11g with a wing of just 18cm.   "},{"url":null,"title":"Homeschooling stress fuels surge anxiety lockdown married couples worst affected","story":"Share this article\u002719 million adults in Great Britain report high levels of anxiety.\u0027One particularly striking finding is that 39 per cent of people who are married or in a civil partnership, reported high levels of anxiety. This compares with 19 per cent pre-pandemic.\u0027It may in part be because of the challenges of homeschooling alongside work and other responsibilities.\u0027Another marked change is in those aged 65 years or older. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic we consistently saw lower anxiety ratings in those aged 65 years and older, but now we are seeing the highest levels of anxiety amongst this group in lockdown\u0027. The figures were released days after the Government approved the creation of \u0027support bubbles\u0027 containing two households, a move designed to help lonely people living alone and under-pressure single parents.The latest easing of lockdown policies that were first introduced in March were \u0027a targeted intervention to limit the most harmful effects of the current social restrictions\u0027, according to Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Families have been kept apart for almost three months since lockdown was formally introduced on March 23, with over 70s told to stay indoors and those labeled as \u0027clinically vulnerable\u0027 due to pre-existing conditions ordered to shield. Almost half of those under the age of 60 reported worsening mental health, compared with 26 per cent of those aged 70-74 and 23 per cent of those aged over 75.Women were also more likely than men to say their mental health had got worse over time.The ONS released data on anxiety levels across the UK today.While it believes there is a link between homeschooling and anxiety it was unable to directly correlate the two, with its report noting: \u0027The reason for this is the large number of missing responses to the homeschooling questions and they are not missing at random, they were simply not asked the question as they do not have dependent children. \u0027If we omitted these people, it would cause large bias to the model and decrease the overall sample size and consequently would have a worse model.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90fd539c026ea7a33d9c768cbf3a8546d340a62a/0_1417_7086_4252/master/7086.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c522aed9e502e4d34460bc5d956bd96e","title":"the big picture a beach of her own lagos 2006","story":"In a city of nearly 20 million people, Akinbode Akinbiyi captures a moment of calmness amid the frenzyAkinbode Akinbiyi has lived and taken photographs in many cities. He was born in Oxford in 1946, went to university in Ibadan, Nigeria, is based in Berlin and has spent long periods in Khartoum, Bamako, Cairo and Dakar. He has suggested that the cities choose him: “They call out my name, and if I am fully awake, I hear the call and gradually wend my way toward them.”\u0026nbspHe took this picture at Bar Beach on Victoria Island in Lagos in 2006. The woman in her white Sunday robes stands in curious relation to the three deck chairs. In other pictures in an ongoing series from the beach – Sea Never Dry – white tourists sit in similar chairs watching the procession of workers and schoolchildren pass by on the sand. Here the chairs are empty, and the woman expresses a quiet gesture of expectation or supplication, almost lost against the pale greys of sea and sky. The picture sets the tone of a retrospective of Akinbiyi’s work in Berlin entitled Six Songs, Swirling Gracefully in the Taut Air. Lagos is a city of nearly 20 million people, yet in among the frenzy of street scenes, Akinbiyi’s camera invariably locates little moments of stillness, like cool alleyways of time.\u0026nbspAkinbiyi studied literature before he became a photographer and his model has always been Langston Hughes, the great poet of the Harlem renaissance. In particular he has been drawn to Hughes’s philosophy, encapsulated in the title of his autobiography, I Wonder As I Wander. Like Hughes, Akinbiyi is a walking artist, part of the scene he describes, waiting for images to make sense around him. When he was interviewed about his Berlin show, and asked about his photographic technique, he preferred to talk of conscious breathing, of finding the mental space in the midst of frantic urban busyness to see what might actually be going on.\u0026nbspAkinbode Akinbiyi: Six Songs, Swirling Gracefully in the Taut Air is at Gropius Bau, Berlin, until 19 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f963af773b19a0db2c9f9bf40c4f5734de394ff/0_452_3737_2241/master/3737.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c71574ab452955abd819d2a53b0d8e8","title":"going bananas in lockdown photographer jenny van sommers fruit obsession","story":"Van Sommers has worked for Prada, Calvin Klein and Vogue. But all she really wants to do is paint bananasUntil recently, you would have most likely found Jenny van Sommers analysing the fruit aisle of her local Sainsbury’s in Bermondsey. Four years ago, she took up painting and, after a brief foray into rock studies (“the rocks didn’t give much back”), bananas became her obsession.“Bananas are my muse”, she says. “The banana paintings have saved me from a million types of despair and boredom. I love them. I love painting them and listening to records. Life makes perfect sense when painting bananas. I am thinking, ‘Be the banana’.” Her paintings are stylistically simple, with a dirty humour reminiscent of artists such as Sarah Lucas and Rebecca Warren.Van Sommers, the child of two academics, describes her mother as a “classic tree-hugging, bra-burning feminist”, who encouraged her not to learn to cook, sew or type. Her father is an artist and professor of psychology who used Jenny as a test subject in the puzzle and drawing experiments featured in his books on art and the brain. He spent time in a boy’s home when his mother couldn’t feed him during the 1930s depression in Australia, so when it came to his daughter’s career, he was keen she found a vocation that allowed her to support herself.Since 1998 when she moved her life from Sydney, Van Sommers has carved out a career as one of the most sought after still-life photographers in London. She’s shot ads for Calvin Klein and Prada, and worked for Vogue. “I became a still-life photographer because it’s a solo pursuit – just a shape and how to light it … how to see it.”In recent years, she has made the time to put down the camera and pick up the paintbrush. Her new works shares some of the characteristics of her well-known photographs. She probes the depths of stillness through a exploration of shadows, surfaces and reflections. She says painting is a welcome respite from the crazy speed of living.“I have spent the last 20 years in London chasing things that ultimately didn’t mean much. Paintings are, for me, a way of going back to the slow pace – taking time over something,” she says. “Sometimes I paint over them again to make the paint thicker so there is a three week drying time between layers. Stopping to change the record and sit and look at the painting for a while is good too.”Painting might be a new way to work for Van Sommers, but her passion is voracious. “It’s late in the day to start out as an artist, I did my first painting when I was 50. I figure if I paint every day I can make up for lost time eventually.” When the noose of lockdown tightened, she had a giant banana commission to accomplish. However, like many of us, the new and unusual feelings that came with isolation led to procrastination and walking – dog walking in her case.As she stalked her local streets she began eyeing up the walls of a nearby kebab shop and, with the blessing of Raoul, the owner, she got to work painting it. Now the property is the colours of Liquorice Allsorts and covered in vessels and cocktails. “I started painting gin and tonics because, like many people, I’ve been drinking more lately. I wanted to do something ordinary and domestic because I felt that my world has gotten much, much smaller with lockdown. My street feels like a tiny place in a massive city and it’s cosy now with no one else around.”The irony, then, is that Van Sommers’ solitary painting brought a new intimacy with her local community. “My street is tiny and a bit run down, so no one minded me painting the colours and the drinks. I moved in 15 years ago but it’s doing this has made me get to know everyone – and I love that. When I walk my dog I have a little chat with the neighbours through their window. It’s a very nice feeling and a totally new one for me. I think that is the lockdown effect, everything gets localised.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30dad83beabdf98dd82088b3808826d0ef79e03/184_136_2218_2767/master/2218.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a69c74779da64c087dd11e3cf0a89a01 1240w","title":"britain can no longer ignore its darkest chapters we must teach black history","story":"As they take to the streets and tear down statues, younger generations who have educated themselves are exposing how whitewashed the national curriculum isWhat was invisible yesterday is today suddenly clear and obvious. In the space of just two weeks, forms of structural racism that black people and their allies had, for years, struggled to draw attention to or even get acknowledged have become seemingly irrefutable. If the toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol was the most unexpected and astonishing event of recent days, perhaps second has been the sheer scale of the online discussions about racism and black history that have begun to take shape across the world.\u0026nbspBooks on both of those subjects have by now largely sold out online. Today printing presses across the country are whirring away, busily printing new copies of books on black topics written by black authors. This great surge in interest and engagement has, like much else in our culture, been boosted by the power of celebrity. Actors and singers\u0026nbsphave shared lists of the books they are reading as they grapple with the ideas and chapters of the past that have been brought to the surface by the global Black Lives Matter protests. British Vogue, perhaps in part because its editor-in-chief Edward Enninful is of African heritage, issued its own list of recommended books. Given the fashion industry’s recent record on race (remember Gucci’s “blackface” turtleneck sweater and Prada’s “minstrel” figurines) this feels like a particularly significant intervention. Meanwhile, lockdown and social distancing means that more people have more time than ever to read and expand their understanding of an issue they might previously have cared about but never found the time to properly investigate or engage with.The pandemic has demonstrated that social problems, such as street homelessness, which, only yesterday, were (conveniently) regarded as intractable can be addressed if the will is there. And this great wave of demonstrations has achieved something comparable when it comes to race and racism. It has created, or perhaps uncovered, a previously unknown willingness on the part of millions to at least try to better understand the issues and engage in a process of self-education.Organisations as well as iniduals are undergoing this transition. Institutions that had dismissed notions of structural racism or rejected forms of black protest suddenly recognise them as legitimate. Since 2016, the US National Football League had refused to allow black players to protest against police brutality and endemic racism in the US by taking a knee. A simple, peaceful act of protest and solidarity. Then, at the end of last week, the league reversed its policy. The reason given for this by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is as significant as the decision itself. “We were wrong” he admitted, “for not listening to NFL players earlier”.\u0026nbspAt the heart of this astonishing moment is a newfound capacity of both iniduals and institutions to engage in these two key activities: listening and learning. Both are on the minds of the mainly young Black Lives Matter protesters who are taking to the streets here in the UK. While more people than ever are willing to listen to their message, we in Britain will have a harder time when it comes to the learning part. This is because we start from such a low base as our education system has, for decades, rejected pleas and requests made by two generations of black British people for black history to be made a core part of the national curriculum. As a result it is a national blind spot, a gap in our collective knowledge that affects us all – black and white.I went to school in the 70s and the 80s, and the last thing I expected of my schools back then was that they would be the places in which I would be taught about black history. In my school, racism was ubiquitous and unrelenting, and not just from the pupils. For a year I was terrorised by one of my teachers. A man who drank his tea from a mug emblazoned with one of the National Front’s slogans. A man who, one night on a camping trip, beat and punched me, when no one was looking, leaving me too fearful to tell anyone, even my mother, for months. A teacher who entertained my classmates by calling me “wog” in the playground. The idea that this environment was one in which I might be gifted with knowledge of a history that would make sense of my identity as a black British person was, under the circumstances, preposterous. My expectations of my school were as low as they could be. Appropriate, given that my teachers, with one blessed exception, had dismally low expectations of me and presumed I would get nowhere in life.Since I began presenting programmes about black history my life has become a constant impromptu focus group.\u0026nbspI am stopped in the street by people who want to talk about the histories those documentaries explore. Most of those people are young, and a great many, but not all, are black or mixed race. This is the generation who have led the Black Lives Matter protests and they, quite rightly, expect more from their schools than I did from mine.\u0026nbspThey are frustrated at the absence of lessons on black history and, critically, they have sources of information that my generation did not. As well as the internet they have books by writers such as Akala, Afua Hirsch and Reni Eddo-Lodge. They read and research, and then compare and contrast what they learn with what they are offered by the national curriculum. Consequently, they are acutely aware of what they are not being taught, what is being missed out. In my experience this is a generation with a low tolerance for half-truths and half-stories. What they tell me is that they know they are being taught a whitewashed, sanitised version of the British past. One in which their stories, those that make sense of who they are and how they and their families came to be here and how they came to be British, have been largely omitted.\u0026nbspThe lucky ones have teachers who, like the many I have met, either face to face or online, go out of their way to change the paradigm and better serve the children in their care. Such teachers do the best they can to teach the black history modules that now do exist within the national curriculum. But the problem is that these modules are optional rather than compulsory, meaning teachers have to find the time to teach them with limited resources and in a packed timetable. Some teachers dedicated to this cause have created their own teaching resources and bought text books with their own money. They come together online to offer support to one another and to ask for help from black British historians. But there aren’t enough of them.There have long been calls for the national curriculum to properly incorporate black British history. The latest come from an initiative called the Black Curriculum, which was begun in 2019 by Lavinya Stennett, a graduate of the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London. This week she launched a new campaign in which members of the public are being asked to sign an open letter to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, requesting that black history be made compulsory, in order to help “build a sense of identity in every young person in the UK”, Stennett says. Williamson has been asked to reply to the letter by the symbolically significant date of 22 June Windrush Day.\u0026nbspIn some circles what happened on Sunday in Bristol is being discussed solely as a public order issue, yet the events of the weekend are intimately connected to issues of education, self-education and the failures of the national curriculum. Some have denounced the toppling of the Edward Colston statue as wanton destruction. Unquestionably it was a destructive act, but if this was simply an outpouring of incoherent rage, why did the crowd of young protesters, people of all races, specifically target the memorial to a 17th-century slave trader. Why not attack and loot the nearby shops?\u0026nbspIf, as we are told from some quarters, the protesters were mere “thugs” – a term dripping in dog-whistle tabloid racism – then how do we account for the lucid, fluent and persuasive interviews that many of them gave to the local news and online platforms? Listen to them. Hear how much they know about Colston, the Royal African Company, the Triangular Trade, the Middle Passage and the rest of it.\u0026nbspLittle about the actions of the young people who pulled Colston from his pedestal and those who cheered him on his descent to the bottom of Bristol harbour, was random. Much of it was emblematic of a generation of young black Britons and their white friends and classmates who have educated themselves on the realities of the slave trade and slavery just as they have on the structural nature of racism.\u0026nbspThey know that they cannot rely on the national curriculum to provide the history that we all need, no matter our race or ethnicity. They know how urgently we need a new curriculum that makes sense of our history, with all its dark chapters included. It is those stories, the ones we find uncomfortable as well as the ones we celebrate, that have created the nation we have become. This, along with much else, is what has to change.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cae6e7ff4d0d003889c73f5c89bedf73c859c753/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f43747c6fa0d37620cdb07b7b1f19249","title":"are you returning to work in a non essential shop in england","story":"We would like to hear from those who will be going back to work in retail shops that have been closed during lockdownAll non-essential shops in England will be able to reopen on Monday as announced by the business secretary, Alok Sharma.

Since then we have been in action, developing our strategy to become a more ersified, resilient and lower-carbon company. As part of that process, we have been reviewing our price assumptions over a longer horizon. That work has been informed by the Covid-19 pandemic, which increasingly looks as if it will have an enduring economic impact.”BP said the aftermath of the pandemic will accelerate the pace of transition to a lower-carbon economy and energy system, as countries seek to make their economies more resilient in the future.The coronavirus lockdown has virtually halted international travel and tourism, hitting airlines and other travel companies, aerospace and auto manufacturers and oil companies hard.As these businesses adjust to dramatically reduced revenue projections, job losses are starting to mount alarmingly.

Rolls-Royce will make the first round of redundancies through a voluntary programme, with about 1,500 posts being lost at its headquarters in Derby, as well as 700 redundancies in Inchinnan, near\u0026nbspGlasgow, another 200 at its Barnoldswick site in Lancashire, and 175 in Solihull, Warwickshire.BentleyThe luxury carmaker intends to\u0026nbspshrink its workforce by almost a quarter, slashing 1,000 roles through a voluntary redundancy scheme. The majority of Bentley’s 4,200 workers are based in Crewe in Cheshire.BPThe oil company plans to make\u0026nbsp10,000 people redundant worldwide, including an estimated 2,000 in the UK, by the end of the year. The BP chief executive, Bernard Looney, said that the majority of people affected would be those in office-based jobs, including at the most senior levels. BP said it would reduce the number of group leaders by a third, and protect the “frontline” of the company, in its operations.British AirwaysThe UK flag carrier is holding consultations to\u0026nbspmake up to 12,000 of its staff redundant, a reduction of one in four jobs at the airline. BA intends to cut roles among its cabin crew, pilots and ground staff, while significantly reducing its operations at Gatwick airport.Virgin Atlantic Richard Branson’s airline is to\u0026nbspcut\u0026nbspmore than 3,000 jobs, more than a third of its workforce, and will shut its operations at Gatwick.RyanairThe Irish airline intends to slash 3,000 roles and reduce staff pay by up to a fifth.P\u0026ampO FerriesThe shipping firm intends to cut more than a quarter of its workforce,\u0026nbspa loss of 1,100 jobs. The company, which operates passenger ferries between Dover and Calais, and across the Irish Sea, as well as Hull to Rotterdam and Zeebrugge, will initially offer employees voluntary redundancy.CentricaThe owner of British Gas is to slash 5,000 jobs, saying it was looking to cut costs by simplifying its business structure. The company is removing three layers of management, with more than half of the job losses falling on leadership roles, including half its 40-strong senior team.Heathrow AirportVoluntary redundancy has been offered to all of its 7,000 direct employees after coronavirus wiped out its passenger traffic.Referring to the 2015 Paris climate agreement, Looney said: “We have reset our price outlook to reflect that impact and the likelihood of greater efforts to ‘build back better’ towards a Paris-consistent world. We are also reviewing our development plans.“All that will result in a significant charge in our upcoming results but I am confident that these difficult decisions – rooted in our net zero ambition and reaffirmed by the pandemic – will better enable us to compete through the energy transition.”The company estimates that this will result in write-offs of $13bn to $17.5bn, which will drag down its financial results in the second quarter. It is also reviewing whether to develop some of its potential oilfields.Looney said that since BP pledged in February to become a net zero carbon company by 2050 or sooner, it had been working on its strategy and reviewed its price assumptions over a longer period.

The lockdown has cost non-food retailers £1.7bn a week in lost sales, according to the Office for National Statistics.Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC), said that even as retailers reopened there was “still a risk that many physical shops could end up closing their doors again – only this time, permanently”.The BRC said retailers were in dire straits, and called on the government to temporarily cut VAT to help boost demand. “A mix of low consumer confidence and limits on the number of people able to enter stores mean that many shops will continue to suffer lower footfall – and lower sales – for some time to come,” Dickinson explained.The lockdown has wiped out an entire season for fashion retailers, with Debenhams, Quiz and Monsoon among the high street names to have announced store closures and job losses during the quarantine. The latest sign of distress comes from upmarket fashion brand AllSaints, which is asking its landlords for steep rent cuts – using an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) – at its 40 UK stores so it can ride out the storm.Even with shops open, Britons need to feel confident it is safe to return. A recent poll by the Royal Society for Public Health found about half of the respondents planned to visit the high street less frequently than before the pandemic despite widespread new safety measures.Stores in European countries, such as France and Italy, which are several weeks ahead of the UK in emerging from the lockdown, have seen footfall rise by about 15 to 25 percentage points from their nadir.Neil Old, who runs high street jewellers H Samuel and Ernest Jones, said there might be an initial surge in trading this week but he is worried that it could take a while for footfall to recover.“There might be an initial surge as the doors first open then, as the dust settles, there will be a new underlying level of footfall going into stores,” he said.“Until we know how people are going to respond to this new environment it’s very difficult to predict how quickly footfall will go back to pre-pandemic levels, but I honestly believe that it will build across the summer.”The US-owned jeweller has permanently closed 82 of its 435 UK stores in response to the lockdown and changing shopping habits, including the shift to online shopping.Waterstones, which is reopening about 230 stores on Monday, is optimistic shoppers will want to return after months of getting their retail fix online. “No matter how good your algorithms are, it’s simply data,” said it chief operating officer, Kate Skipper. “The interaction between bookseller and customer means you can provide bespoke recommendations. Our stores still feel exactly like a bookshop but with the safety measures that I think everybody expects to see.”The reopening of 160 Entertainer stores feels celebratory to Grant. He said at points he went from “genuinely thinking it would go bust” to being confident it would survive, albeit “weaker and bruised”.“It is a really important day for us, as a retailer, that we can actually open our shops to the public again. We think we’re actually going to be quite busy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb4dc73a1dc8dc5ab331ffe78654595094a554e8/0_117_3538_2125/master/3538.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=66f9d7dcc79595dab31ab56d00b00fb3","title":"unilever vows to invest 1bn in green projects","story":"Multinational’s 10-year plan puts focus on plastics and greener transport and productionUnilever has pledged to invest €1bn (£900m) over the next decade in environmental projects that will improve the “health of the planet”.Alan Jope, Unilever’s chief executive, said that while the world was rightly focused on the devastating coronavirus outbreak and serious issues of inequality raised by the Black Lives Matter protests, the climate emergency should not be overlooked. “We can’t let ourselves forget that the climate crisis is still a threat to all of us,” he said.The consumer goods giant, which owns more than 400 brands including Marmite, Dove, Comfort and Sure, said that in response to the “scale and urgency of the climate crisis”, it was also setting a target of net-zero emissions from all its products by 2039.The company has already promised to reduce the mountain of plastic rubbish that its products generate, but Jope said it was just as important to look at the “impact they have on the planet at the start of their life” – in the sourcing of materials, as well as in their manufacture and transport.Unilever said its €1bn “Climate \u0026amp Nature Fund” would be used to fund projects ranging from landscape restoration and carbon capture to wildlife protection and water preservation. It also pledges to have a “deforestation-free” supply chain within three years, and to harness emerging digital technologies – such as satellite monitoring and geolocation tracking – to increase traceability and transparency.Jope has warned that the company would sell off brands that could not meet its own sustainability targets. It was no longer enough for consumer goods companies to sell washing powders that made shirts whiter or shampoos that make hair shinier, because consumers wanted brands that had a “purpose” too, he said.Last week, the FTSE 100-listed company announced that it had picked London as its home in an about-face on the company’s 2018 decision to opt for Rotterdam, which was abandoned after a revolt by British shareholders. If investors back the plan, it will bring an end to the company’s complex dual structure, a hangover from Unilever’s formation through the merger of a Dutch margarine producer and a British soapmaker 91 years ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/417e9b8ac7ba259bbccf7e2eabc08444555d6608/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a35bc67259574d6e4b96eca2f9d6f30","title":"romany gypsy racism britain prejudice roma travellers","story":"I grew up facing prejudice against Gypsies and Travellers. Now the Conservative government and media are still failing us Growing up in a small town in Lancashire, I was surrounded by others who looked and sounded like me. It was a three-bedroomed, semi-detached, 2.4 children sort of working-class normality. Except my family are Romany Gypsies. I remember from a very young age being acutely aware of my difference from the other children in my school. My dad had instilled in us that it was important to be cautious when it came to ulging our ethnicity. Having suffered many instances of poor treatment due to his race while growing up, he was trying to protect us.My cousin was my classmate throughout my early years, and I remember a time when we both got bullied quite badly: somehow one of our classmates had found out and started calling us “Gyppo” in the playground. This only strengthened the idea that I should try to preserve and protect this element of my identity from the outside world. I went through high school in the early noughties, a time when Britain’s newspapers were flaring up with regard to Gypsies and Travellers. In 2005, the Sun launched a now-infamous campaign titled “Stamp on the camps”, which ran for several weeks. It was so bad that there were families in our community who were scared to send their children to school for fear of attacks. Fifteen years on, it sometimes feels that we haven’t progressed at all. In April, Channel 4 ran the episode of Dispatches, The Truth About Traveller Crime. It was laden with harmful stereotypes and, in the words of the charity Friends, Families and Travellers, was “dehumanising, unbalanced and unfair”. It is now under review by Ofcom.Throughout my teens and adulthood, I have experienced so many instances of racism and prejudiced views. Anti-Gypsy rhetoric is an acceptable everyday racism. I’ve sat in training sessions at work and had to listen to damaging stereotypes of Gypsy customers, and I’ve experienced death threats online for speaking out about Gypsy, Roma and Traveller (GRT) rights on television. As an adult I’m presented with three choices in any new environment I enter, whether that be a workplace, a friendship or even a relationship: “come out” to the person and make clear my ethnicity from the off but risk unfavourable treatment drip-feed them bits of information and hope they connect the dots themselves or stay silent, and hope that they don’t say anything offensive or upsetting about my culture. I am constantly having to shrink or dilute my ethnicity to be more palatable to others.Racism and poor treatment against Gypsies, Travellers and Roma people is nothing new. Half a million Roma people were killed during the Holocaust, for instance. Roma are the biggest ethnic minority within the European Union yet often get unfavourable treatment and are very rarely represented fairly. Many European countries to this day still have such things as segregated schools for Roma children, blocked access to housing registers and children being separated from their families by authorities. In 2010, the then French president Nicolas Sarkozy even paid Roma people €300 (£269) each to leave the country.This month is GRT History Month. It’s an opportunity to celebrate our rich and erse culture but to also take personal responsibility for educating ourselves about the history of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller people. Gypsies have been a part of British life since the 16th century, yet are still largely not accepted as part of our society. We must all seek to dismantle the institutional racism faced by our community, and that involves putting pressure on the media, the government and the other agencies that are failing us. My dad always told me: “Not everyone is going to like you”, but I’d welcome a world where my ethnicity wasn’t one of the reasons why.• Grace Claire O’Neill is a photographer who campaigns for Gypsy, Romany and Traveller rights and representation"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/758238401d2d4bdb151e5ba04cdb5e6be1f61327/635_193_2908_1745/master/2908.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c536c193e1d48b195dd1b4279cecfd8d","title":"emissions from 13 dairy firms match those of entire uk says report","story":"Exclusive: Milk giants’ climate impact rising and production caps needed, say researchersThe biggest dairy companies in the world have the same combined greenhouse gas emissions as the UK, the sixth biggest economy in the world, according to a new report.The report, by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) in the US, also says the growth of giant dairy companies has helped force milk prices below the cost of production for the last decade, causing a crisis in rural livelihoods and requiring taxpayer subsidies to keep farmers afloat. The researchers say caps on production should be reintroduced to protect both the climate and small farmers.“Unlike growing public scrutiny on fossil fuel companies, little public pressure exists to hold global meat and dairy corporations accountable for their emissions,” said Shefali Sharma, European director at IATP and report author. “Few of these companies are even reporting their emissions.”“As governments ratchet up their climate goals, the rise of large-scale dairy and public incentives that further increase corporate dairy power, production and emissions must be stopped,” she said. “Rural livelihoods and our planet’s future depend on it.”Dairy industry representatives said the report did not reflect the reality of the dairy sector. In a joint statement, Judith Bryans, president of the International Dairy Federation, and Donald Moore, executive director of the Global Dairy Platform, said: “The dairy sector is committed to producing nutritious foods in environmentally sound and responsible ways.”“It’s very easy to put out a report that criticises and tries to paint a simple picture of a sector which doesn’t contain all of the nuances or realities of how the global dairy sector nourishes the world with nutrient-rich, safe foods and does so in a manner that strives for continued environmental improvements while providing livelihoods to a large percentage of the world’s population,” said Bryans and Moore.A 2019 joint report by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and Global Dairy Platform said: “In order to limit temperature rise, the dairy sector must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and work towards a low-carbon future … There is a clear case for immediate and more ambitious action.”The IATP report used the UN FAO’s global livestock environmental assessment model to assign emission levels to dairy produced in different regions. These were then applied to the companies’ production quantities as calculated by the IFCN dairy research network.The IATP report found emissions from the big companies rose from 306m tonnes of CO2-equivalent in 2015 to 338m tonnes in 2017. The UK’s annual emissions are 350m tonnes a year.“There is growing support for supply management, a crucial policy that could address dairy’s twin crises. It prevents overproduction, balances supply and demand and stabilises prices,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2bd0f8c8ad6dc0fc914eaed1badf2904b916db9/0_231_3620_2172/master/3620.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71645e56bd5b93082f950d77fb2933e4","title":"hopes dashed that resurgent pine martens can save uks red squirrel","story":"Belfast study finds pine martens don’t venture into urban areas, where invasive grey squirrels thriveHopes that the resurgent predatory pine marten might “biologically control” grey squirrels and benefit the UK’s native red squirrels have been dashed by a new study, which found pine martens avoided urban areas.Researchers from Queen’s University, Belfast, suggested that even if greys were driven out of rural areas, their populations would be constantly replenished from cities, where they thrived.The lead author of the research, Joshua Twining, of Queen’s University Belfast, said: “As the pine marten does not occupy urban areas anywhere within its European range, it is not likely to be the sole solution to the invasive grey squirrel. If action is not taken to support the pine marten in the long run, we may see a reversal of their current success and doom our native red squirrels.”Earlier studies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland discovered that the pine marten created “a landscape of fear” for the grey squirrel, and drove away populations. Although pine martens, which almost became extinct during the 20th century, will also kill red squirrels, the smaller native squirrel has evolved and adapted to survive alongside the marten for thousands of years.Grey squirrels were introduced into Britain and then Ireland in the 19th century from North America. The larger, heavier animals outcompete reds but also carry and spread squirrelpox, which does not affect greys but is rapidly fatal to reds.The Belfast study used camera traps operated by citizen scientists at 332 sites across Northern Ireland in both urban and rural areas to measure pine martens and red and grey squirrels. Models were then used to predict the future distribution of the three species.The results revealed that pine martens were deciduous woodland specialists, less numerous in non-native coniferous plantations, and displayed a strong aversion to busy urban areas. The study, published in the Journal of Applied Ecology, expected grey squirrels to persist in parkland areas of towns and cities.Twining said: “The ability of the pine marten to control the grey squirrel and help red squirrel recovery in Ireland and Britain is limited by three things: its ongoing recovery, the lack of forest cover on the islands and the presence of urban refugia.”The researchers warn that these “refuges” are likely to buy the grey squirrel population enough time to develop novel genotypes which will allow it more successfully to evade the pine marten with anti-predator behaviours. Other studies have found that species can develop anti-predator responses to novel predators within a few generations.The study found this could enable grey squirrels to recolonise woodland landscapes dominated by the pine marten in parts of Ireland and Scotland and continue to displace red squirrels, and drive them to the brink of extinction.The study argued that control of urban grey squirrels was required alongside native woodland afforestation, which would increase marten populations and their ability to control greys and help reds recover. Ireland and Britain are among the least forested countries in Europe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b9e5e2b2832255d01a8cf5590b8deb7ac946918/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2260330fd95c3723b06b9f3d81227270","title":"leading uk charities urge pm seek green recovery covid 19","story":"Group of 57 organisations says bailouts must be on condition of firms reducing carbon footprintThe chiefs of some of Britain’s leading charities have written to the prime minister to demand a “green recovery” from the coronavirus crisis, urging him to use economic rescue packages to build low-carbon infrastructure and spur the creation of long-term green jobs.The group of 57 charities representing 22 million members called for any bailouts to be subject to strict conditions so that companies receiving state help in the Covid-19 crisis would have to meet low-carbon targets, and for all elements of any economic recovery package to be subject to a test to ensure they were in line with the UK’s target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050.They also want ministers to cancel, rather than suspend, the debts of developing countries struggling with the impact of Covid-19 and the climate crisis.Charities including the Women’s Institute, the National Trust, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), Oxfam and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) signed the letter, which comes after weeks in which ministers have made references to the need for a sustainable recovery, but without providing policy details.“We know a green recovery makes economic sense, and is supported here in the UK and overseas by leading businesses, academics, ministers and health representatives,” said Tanya Steele, the chief executive of WWF UK, one of the organisers of the letter. “What we urgently need to see now, and post-pandemic, is commitments from government on turning this into action.”The campaigners said investing in a green recovery could support at least 210,000 green jobs and bring benefits of £90bn a year, from economic rejuvenation and better health.The charities include poverty campaigners and faith groups, as well as green pressure groups. Melissa Green, the general secretary of the Women’s Institute (WI), said: “WI members are clear that post-Covid-19 economic packages need to incorporate robust and ambitious green policies in order to get on track for net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner.”The charities join an increasing number of economists, health professionals, leading climate experts, developing countries and the government’s own statutory advisers, who are all calling for a green recovery to lift countries out of recession and on to a low-carbon pathway.Fossil fuel companies and high emitters such as airlines and carmakers have already benefited from billions in public finance from the recovery package, without green strings attached.Carbon dioxide emissions, which plunged when  lockdowns took effect, had since begun to rebound sharply, research found last week. Experts fear that without strong government interventions, the UK will return to business as usual with high carbon emissions, or that emissions could rise to levels above pre-lockdown levels, if people desert public transport in favour of driving their cars.The UK is widely seen internationally as holding a particular responsibility for leading the world into a green recovery because the government will host the next vital UN climate summit. Called Cop26, and now postponed by a year to take place in Glasgow in November 2021, the conference is seen as the last chance for nations to get back on track to meet the goals of the Paris agreement and avoid catastrophic climate breakdown.“As host of Cop26, the UK government has an immense responsibility to lead the world to a green and just recovery,” said Clara Goldsmith, the campaigns director for the Climate Coalition. “This is the only way to build a resilient economic recovery which ensures we keep global heating to no more than 1.5C and supports the most vulnerable. We have one chance and we must not waste it.”Campaigners have been frustrated by the government’s lack of any policy detail on the possibility of a green recovery, and the lack of any clear agenda for Cop26.The charities laid out a seven-point plan, similar in content to the advice given by economic experts and the Committee on Climate Change, the statutory body that advises ministers on meeting the UK’s carbon targets. Their demands include: new public investment in energy efficiency, renewable energy and zero-carbon transport setting up a climate infrastructure bank trade deals that support British farming, to ensure greater protection for nature ending fossil fuel finance, in the UK and overseas helping to halt the decline of bioersity around the world.They also called for a new government committee, led by a minister, to work with civil society groups on delivering a green recovery."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/415edef2931ede625df5c8e3e0ad356b6c66612f/207_321_2339_1404/master/2339.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55d3fe04461de29c0d220ef2a2eedad9","title":"the classic film ive never seen halloween","story":"John Carpenter’s 1978 original slasher film isn’t scary at all – it’s too clunky for thatI’m a wimp when it comes to horror films, as anyone who has ever sat next to me in a cinema while I’ve been yelping my head off will tell you. I’ve forced myself to watch some of the classics, and I’ve loved some of the new ones such as Get Out and A Quiet Place. But I’ve succeeded in avoiding\u0026nbspFriday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street and\u0026nbspthe other slasher movies of the 1970s and 80s. And, until last week, I’d never seen the one which gets all the acclaim, Halloween. I knew it was important, of course. I’d spotted the references in everything from Scream to Baby Driver, and I’d heard of Rob Zombie’s\u0026nbspremake, as well as David Gordon Green’s\u0026nbspsequel. But whenever I thought about braving the 1978 original, which was directed by John Carpenter, I’d always leave my DVD in its shrink-wrapped box and pick up a romcom instead.So here’s what surprised me about my long-overdue viewing: Halloween isn’t scary at all. It’s too clunky for that. It may terrify teenagers at a sleepover, but watching it in broad daylight in middle-age brings a sort of patronising respect for the plucky low-budget film-makers who managed to get 90 minutes out of a handful of actors, two clapboard houses and a wisp of plot.You might admire Carpenter’s insistent 54 piano theme, the early twist that a homicidal maniac is actually a six-year-old boy, and the grownup Michael Myers’ gymnastic escape from an asylum on a dark and stormy night. You might appreciate the way the Steadicam prowls through a grid of all-American suburban streets, as if searching for victims. As for the victims, the only bearable one is Jamie Lee Curtis’s studious Laurie, a spiritual cousin of Sandy from Grease, which came out the same year. On that note, why do the main characters include Laurie, Loomis, Lynda, Lyndsey, Lonnie and Lester? What the L is going on?What surprised me most about Halloween was how little it has to do with the 31 October Halloween. Carpenter scatters around a few references to pumpkins and trick-or-treaters, just as the set decorator scatters around a few brown leaves. (The film was shot in May, which explains why the neighbourhood’s trees are so lush and green.) But no one gets drowned while bobbing for apples, and the masked serial killer doesn’t hide among crowds of revellers in fancy dress. It could have been set on any night of the year. (An early draft of the script, I’ve since learned, had a more appropriate but less iconic title: The Babysitter Murders.)The other big surprise was how ineffectual Myers is. His doctor (Donald Pleasence) keeps saying that he is evil incarnate. Dr Loomis made his diagnosis while the boy sat silently in a cell for 15 years, so he must be quite some psychiatrist. But the so-called figure of The Shape totters along so slowly that he would lose a race with any of George A Romero’s zombies in Night of the Living Dead. And he should have cut wider eyeholes in his mask, because he repeatedly fails to stab Laurie at point-blank range. She, on the other hand, stabs him with a knitting needle, a coat hanger and a kitchen knife, so Carpenter and Hill missed a trick – or a treat – by not making her the villain in Halloween II.Her stabbings don’t draw blood, though. The film is remarkably short of gore by today’s standards. And it’s light on sex and swearing. Perhaps it’s because we are living in a horror movie at the moment, but Halloween now seems sweetly innocent: a glimpse of a peaceful, naive America where a slowcoach in a boilersuit was the most frightening thing around."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/443aea372785b794b7c1d4076e28efea19a03a4a/0_950_8031_4820/master/8031.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=18c31c74f9c8c6832b31b1a33e3b4e9c","title":"thomasina miers coronation chicken salad recipe","story":"Spiced roast coronation chicken thighs smothered in a yoghurt dressingThe thwack of a racket on a tennis ball, the gentle buzzing of bees, the bustle of a summer party … coronation chicken conjures up all this and more, and makes me feel all the more nostalgic given the current restrictions of life.

A superb six-game unbeaten run over the Christmas period helped take the heat off Southampton following a grim autumn (aside from an enjoyable 4-0 win over Portsmouth at Fratton Park) but four defeats from their past five league games means they are still peering over their shoulders, despite what, on the face of it, is a healthy seven-point buffer above the relegation zone. As Ralph Hasenhüttl has said, they cannot afford to get complacent and he lambasted his team’s defending at West Ham as “an absolute joke” the week before coming unstuck at home to Newcastle last time out, a game in which Moussa Djenepo was sent off. The winger has a three-match ban to serve.Even before their form noseed, Danny Ings was prolific in front of goal and the striker was on the brink of an England call-up in March before the season ground to a halt. Jamie Vardy is the only Englishman to have scored more top-flight goals this season and, as much as Ings’s main asset is his predatory instincts going forward, his work-rate is commendable across the pitch. Alex McCarthy has been impressive since ousting Angus Gunn as Hasenhüttl’s first-choice goalkeeper, while the versatile James Ward-Prowse has been dependable both at right-back and in central midfield.What about now? Southampton resume the season at Norwich on Friday evening, when victory would go a long way to securing their top-flight status. They head into the game with a fully-fit squad – Nathan Redmond is raring to go after a muscle injury – and a spring in their step after a flurry of contract extensions, most notably Hasenhüttl pledging his future to the club until 2024. If the Austrian stays for the duration of his contract, he will become the club’s longest-serving manager since Chris Nicholl in 1991. Shane Long has also extended his stay, while Will Smallbone, the 20-year-old midfielder who shone on his league debut in February, has agreed a four-year extension. But mounting speculation surrounding the captain, Pierre-Emile Højbjerg, who has 12 months to run on his contract, is unhelpful. Hasenhüttl has said he will take the captaincy away if the midfielder does not commit beyond next season.What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season? Get more points on the board at St Mary’s. Southampton showed enormous steel and character to recover from the infamous 9-0 defeat to Leicester in October but they have the worst home record in the ision having won only four league matches in front of their own fans all season. It is not all bad – they boast the sixth-best away record – but Saints have struggled on home soil since 2016-17, winning only 20 of their past 72 league matches at St Mary’s, and Hasenhüttl has acknowledged they have struggled to make the most of home territory. “In away games no one expects anything from us,” the Austrian said. “Maybe that’s the reason we perform better in away games.”Have players and staff behaved during lockdown? There were no indiscretions. Hasenhüttl spent much of lockdown in Munich with his family and some players returned to their home countries, with Stuart Armstrong heading to Edinburgh and Højbjerg to Denmark, but now Southampton are firmly focused on finishing a topsy-turvy season on a high.Any unsungcommunity heroes? Djenepo donated more than £7,000 to the health ministry and local authorities in Mopti in his native Mali to help pay for hand sanitiser and key equipment such as face masks. Meanwhile the former defender and club ambassador Franny Benali raised almost £15,000 by running a treadmill marathon in support of the NHS having previously raised more than £1m for Cancer Research UK through a series of gruelling ultra-endurance challenges in recent years. Matt Le Tissier – virtually – joined him for a five-mile stint. Several former players, including Le Tissier, James Beattie and Brian Howard, have been on hand to help the club, in conjunction with FareShare, provide 12,000 meals for some of the most vulnerable in the city. Others have helped pick up prescriptions and contact elderly supporters.Key player in the run-in? Ings – the goals were beginning to dry up before the season was paused but the talisman has been revitalised and leads from the front. His goals will probably determine how well Saints finish.

Here, three stars of social share what they’ve learnedMost businesses these days will have some form of social media presence, but many may not be making the most of the opportunities it provides. Not only does it open up a huge potential customer base – half the world’s population is now on social media – it also gives companies the perfect opportunity to build and retain loyalty among existing customers.Like all aspects of technology, social media is constantly evolving. So while a small business may have set up a Facebook or a Twitter account a few years back and thought that was a case of “job done”, new social media platforms such as TiKTok have been developed since then, while Instagram and YouTube have become vital parts of a holistic social media ecosystem.\u0026nbspBeyond the platforms themselves, trends have also changed in terms of what users want, how they interact with brands and what’s important to them. Customers have now become fans, emotional ties to brands are a thing and thought-leadership can make you an influencer. Content is still king, and shareability is vital.\u0026nbspBut as well as all this modern stuff – the basics are still important too.\u0026nbsp“On the high street you wouldn’t have a shopfront with a broken window, peeling paint, rubbish everywhere and goods randomly thrown on displays, and expect to thrive,” says PR and social media expert Mike Crutchley.As someone who helps businesses improve and overhaul their social media strategies, he says first impressions count.\u0026nbsp“Social media channels must be up to date with everything from posts to contact details and opening hours,” he says. “High-quality images and videos, as well as good grammar and spelling are as vital as creating engaging posts.”The tools that allow businesses to make this happen have never been more accessible, and there is now an opportunity to try some of them out free of charge. Customers of the website builder GoDaddy are currently receiving a complimentary 90-day premium subscription to the mobile app Over, which gives them access to simple templates for creating sleek and effective social media content.Sometimes the things that work best on social media are the simplest. You can have all the metrics and dashboards in the world, but if people don’t engage and share your original posts then you’re missing a huge potential source of customers.\u0026nbspWhen Dutch-born Londoner Annemarie Plas saw people in countries throughout Europe clapping for their healthcare workers she was inspired to help set up something similar in her adopted home, and so created clapforourcarers with GoDaddy.Scaling up quickly could well have proved a challenge, but with the astute use of social media things have gone from strength to strength.\u0026nbsp“I just put together a small image and posted it on my socials such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, and sent it to all my UK friends by WhatsApp, I also made a small website and an Insta page,” says Plas.\u0026nbspHer efforts to spread the word were given a huge boost when her campaign was picked up by influencers such as the Beckhams and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who shared it to their followers.\u0026nbspThe first clap happened on Thursday 26 March at 8pm and became a weekly event, being covered by the national media and circulated widely on social media too, right up to the final clap on 28 May.Although Plas has a background working for media agencies, she had neither the time nor staff support that other organisations might be able to draw upon. So she decided to keep things simple and made shareability a big part of her strategy.\u0026nbsp“I understood the importance of having simple and engaging messaging. I used a hashtag and made the image easy to share on any social channels.”Her simple and consistent messaging has resulted in the #clapforourcarers hashtag being shared more than 139,000 times on Instagram alone.\u0026nbsp“Some influencers get a bad reputation,” says Masha Zvereva, founder of Coding Blonde. She set up her blog back in 2015, when she was trying to learn some coding skills to make her more employable. She originally registered it with GoDaddy, which she then also used as a hosting provider.Through that blog, as well as Instagram and YouTube, Zvereva has amassed a loyal following and is now regarded as an influencer in the field of women in tech, entrepreneurship and personal growth.\u0026nbsp“Influencers can be perceived as fake, superficial, salesy etc, but what people don’t see is the hard work that goes behind being able to make a living off of this business model and growing your business,” she says.Quality content is paramount according to Zvereva. Whether you’re filming a video for YouTube or writing a thought leadership piece, it has to add value beyond simply advertising your skills to the wider world.\u0026nbsp“Anyone can become an influencer if they want to, but I’d recommend approaching it from the standpoint of adding value to an audience,” she says.\u0026nbsp“What’s the purpose behind your blog? How will you be impacting people’s lives and who is your target audience? And finally, why should it be you?”Many people might still associate social media in a business context purely with selling, but its importance when it comes to building a brand can’t be overstated.\u0026nbspThis is something Zaffrin and Brian O’Sullivan, co-founders of the vegan skincare company Five Dot Botanics set out to do well before their company launched.Establishing it on Instagram even before they had products to sell, they were able to develop a loyal audience.\u0026nbsp“Social media has allowed small brands like mine to build a brand. Historically it would not have been possible to launch a beauty brand without millions of pounds to acquire customers through marketing,” says Zaffrin.\u0026nbspBefore setting up those social channels though, their first move was to register a domain name and get a URL through GoDaddy. Then it was time to get the ball rolling with social media.\u0026nbspThe stories the O’Sullivans shared weren’t all about success, but about the challenges they were facing. This honesty helped create a situation where people were rooting for them. The couple were also able to get 600 people signed up to their newsletter email list so there was already an eager customer base waiting for when the products were ready.Once the social channels were up and running, the O’Sullivans set up an internet landing page using GoDaddy’s services – and they were in business.Social continues to be at the heart of their marketing. As well as using Instagram for brand-building, Zaffrin posts to Pinterest and Facebook, although she says the latter works best for business if you’re willing to put money behind it – paying for targeted ads, for example. Otherwise the other platforms can be effective without budget, simply by skilful use. Zaffrin uses LinkedIn to raise her business profile and publish articles, and is curious about TikTok, saying it is “one to watch”.\u0026nbsp“Our audience are our fans,” she says. “They root for our success, and our customers on social tell us every day what they think and what they want. We are constantly listening to them, whether they’re letting us know how they are using our products or coming up with ideas for new ones.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

They live in Perth, Australia, and are expecting their first babyJana Ďoubalova was on her way to a remote part of Iceland for a hiking trip with a friend when she bumped into Chris Curnow at Reykjavik airport in July 2017. “I was off to join a crew on a tall ship that was sailing to Greenland,” he says. “I was looking out for crew members when I spotted Jana.”To kickstart conversation, Chris asked if she was part of the sailing trip. “I was happily single at the time, but as soon as we met I suddenly thought it might be worth reconsidering,” says Jana. They were on the same flight to Ísafjörður, from where Chris’s ship departed. It was delayed, so they had plenty of time to chat in the airport. “I was immediately taken by her intelligence. We were smiling and laughing together. I was spellbound.”When they arrived, he invited Jana and her friend to join him and his crewmates at a pub. “Due to the seating arrangement, I didn’t get much chance to speak to her.” They swapped numbers, but, as he was from Australia and she lived in the Czech Republic, they assumed they would never see each other again. Jana left for her hike around the Hornstrandir peninsula. “I did send her a text message, but she was out of signal,” says Chris.He then set sail, but the ship’s captain decided another night in the fjords was required before they travelled across the Greenland Strait. “We had been hiking when we spotted their ship,” says Jana. “We thought they’d be in Greenland by then, but then we realised it was them.” Seizing the moment, Chris ran to give her a quick kiss goodbye.Later that day, Jana received the text message he had sent, so she replied: “I never thought it would happen, but I asked him if he wanted to come to Prague for a few days after his trip was over.” It was not until a month later that Chris received the message. “I didn’t even hesitate. I immediately rearranged my flights so I could come for a few days on my way back to Australia.” But when he finally got hold of Jana to tell her, she told him she was in France with her family. Due to a family tragedy, Chris was unable to stay until she returned. “He left gifts with his friend to pass on to me,” says Jana. “It was very romantic.”They continued chatting and in October Jana took 10 days off to visit Perth. “All my friends and family were supportive, but they also thought I was crazy,” she says. They enjoyed exploring the city together and took a trip around south-western Australia. “I was so nervous, but it worked. I had no doubts from the first moment,” says Chris. At Christmas, Jana returned for two months. “I was working freelance as an interpreter. It meant we could spend longer together.” Chris was able to continue his work for an environmental NGO.In March 2018, he went to Europe to visit Jana. Shortly afterwards, he enrolled in a Czech language course. “That summer, I made a huge sign in Czech asking if she would marry me. I unfolded it in the arrivals hall in Prague.” They continued their long-distance relationship while they planned the wedding. But in December that year, Chris had a near-fatal accident while on a hike in the Blue Mountains near Sydney. “He had to be rescued by helicopter it was terrifying,” says Jana. The pair ended up spending the next few months at his family home in New South Wales while he recovered.They married in November 2019 and Jana moved to Perth permanently. They are expecting their first baby in December. “Chris is an adventurer and loves to explore. I love his courage,” says Jana. “We have a really close friendship.” Chris says he appreciates his partner’s loving nature. “For the previous 10 years, I had never managed to find a soulmate. I always believed in the hope of never knowing what was around the corner. Jana is incredible.”Want to share your story?

This week: a pine on a protected beach in TurkeyBrian Harrison and his wife, Sue, love visiting Turkey every year. During their trips, they always find time to visit Iztuzu beach, near the south-western coastal town of Dalyan. It’s not just the breathtaking mountains, the clear blue sea and the great food that keep them coming back. Each time, they return to see a contorted Mediterranean pine tree on the beach.“It’s reassuring it’s always there,” says Brian, 71. “It must take a battering every winter, but it always seems to survive and hang on in there. It hasn’t been blown away, it’s stuck into the sand and it has become something we come to every year.”Iztuzu beach is five kilometres long and the tree is at the southern end. “The weather is warm, mild and incredibly welcoming, but the tree reminds me that in winter the conditions are very different,” says Brian. There are not many other trees on the beach. Sadly, it’s not a great spot to rest under as the pine is surrounded by “gravelly” sand and “an undergrowth of wiry, stiff and prickly grass”. The sparse leaves do not provide any shade from the sun.\u0026nbspThe retired teacher and university administrator from Bushey, Hertfordshire, chose this particular picture because it highlights the tree’s distinctive shape. He remains fascinated by its untold story. “What makes this tree stand out for me is how it’s been battered and permanently distorted by the wind,” he says. “It’s clearly got a history, but we don’t know what actually happened to make the tree the shape it is.”\u0026nbspThe entire beach is an environmentally protected breeding area for loggerhead sea turtles. Close to the tree is a therapy and rehabilitation centre to care for turtles injured by fishing lines or collisions with boats. “The turtles tend to come out at night when the beach is closed,” Brian says. “That leaves the whole area free for the turtles to use as they like.” They mainly come ashore to lay their eggs, and when the centre is aware there are eggs buried in the sand, it protects them from being moved or disturbed by human visitors.\u0026nbspBrian has arranged to visit Turkey in September with Sue and some friends, but they are unsure whether the trip will go ahead because of the coronavirus pandemic. “We hope to get back there some time soon to see if the tree is still there.”• Tell us about your favourite tree by filling in this form."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d8d7b9e94d07d02cf1002e7d4b38ff53594b651/27_7_5311_3186/master/5311.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=796f10d4de93c446ee17d8a731981150","title":"how the disappearance of madeleine mccann became a national obsession podcast","story":"The disappearance of a three -year-old British girl at a Portuguese holiday resort in 2007 quickly became a global news story as the hunt for her grew ever more extensive.

He said the work “should not be used in arguments about how much greater the infection risk is at 1-metre minimum distance as opposed to 2 metres”.Doubts about the study emerged as Boris Johnson announced a formal review of the 2-metre physical distancing rule, which is expected to report by 4 July, the earliest date pubs and restaurants may reopen in England. In recent weeks, Johnson has come under intense pressure from Conservative MPs to relax the advice to help businesses, particularly in the hospitality sector.Led by researchers at McMaster University in Ontario, the report pooled data from previously published studies to estimate the risk of becoming infected with coronavirus at different distances. It also considered how face masks and eye protection might help prevent the spread of disease.But in the analysis the authors assume the proportional impact on risk of moving from 2 metres to 1 metre is the same as moving from 1 metre to zero. “They are forcing the proportional fit to be the same,” Spiegelhalter told the .McConway believes there is a more fundamental problem in the way the risks of infection at different distances are compared in the study. He said: “The method of comparing the different distances in the paper is inappropriate for telling you exactly how the risk at 2-metre minimum distance compares to a 1 metre minimum distance. It does not support, and should not be used in, arguments about how much greater the risk is with a 1 metre limit versus a 2-metre limit.”Another scientist, Prof Ben Cowling at the WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control at the University of Hong Kong, flagged further issues with the work. He tweeted that he was “not taking the whole paper very seriously” because it looked only at distance and not how long a person was exposed for.McConway said he had raised questions about the analysis with the authors and was waiting to hear back. He believed peer review by the Lancet and the WHO should have spotted the problems. “I think they did it in such a rush – the authors, possibly the WHO, and the Lancet peer reviewers – that important things were missed,” he said.“Everyone believes that the risk of infection at 1-metre is higher than at 2-metre and we need to know how much higher because there’s a trade-off between the increased risk and the gains from moving to 1-metre. But if you don’t know how the risks at 1 metre and 2 metres compare, how do you know how to trade it off? It’s finger in the air stuff,” McConway said.The most recent public Sage document on physical distancing, updated on 2 May, makes clear that multiple streams of evidence are used to advise on safe distancing, including how long people are together, ventilation and room size, and that the 2-metre advice is no more than a ballpark guide for face-to-face meetings.In a statement, the WHO said it recommends keeping a distance of 1 metre or more.“The evidence used to inform this guidance was based on a systematic review of all available, relevant observational studies concerning protective measures to prevent transmission of the coronaviruses that cause Sars, Mers and Covid-19. After checking for relevance, 44 comparative studies done in health-care and non-health-care settings were included.“The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis support physical distancing of 1 metre or more, which is in line with the existing WHO recommendation that people should physically distance at least 1 metre,” the statement said.The Lancet and the authors of the study have been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36ed5d82a27fae799531fce53ec624ee86ccfecf/0_43_3250_1950/master/3250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a090a9e5a211a6ce51a6d84a79fa895b","title":"countries scramble for flu vaccines to ease pressure of second coronavirus 19 wave","story":"Manufacturers warn they will struggle to meet demand as governments seek to ease pressure on health servicesFears of a second wave of coronavirus have sparked a global scramble for influenza shots from countries that hope to vaccinate great swathes of the population to reduce pressure on their health services.Health officials in the UK are considering whether to offer flu shots to everyone as part of planning for a resurgence of coronavirus in the autumn, but with other countries hitting on the same strategy, demand for flu vaccines has soared.Mass immunisation would aim to slash the number of people hospitalised with the flu this winter, giving the NHS a better chance of coping with any surge in Covid-19 patients that follows the easing of lockdown restrictions. The flu vaccine does not protect against coronavirus infection.One flu vaccine manufacturer, Sanofi, said it had been approached by the UK and other countries about boosting their orders of flu shots for winter 2020-21 but warned that it would struggle to ramp up production in time.“We have been asked by countries across the northern hemisphere, including the UK, about the possibility to provide additional flu vaccine,” a Sanofi spokesperson said. “We are actively seeing what more can be done to meet additional demand, but it will be a challenge.”The government’s Sage committee of scientific experts raised the idea of flu shots for the entire population in April, but the Department of Health and Social Care said a decision had yet to be made. In the UK, the vaccine is already offered to those most at risk, including the over-65s, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems. Flu shots are also made available for primary schoolchildren and health and social care workers.Speaking in a personal capacity, Prof Peter Openshaw at Imperial College, London, who sits on the government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), which feeds into Sage, said: “There is a concern that adding together a bad flu season with a coronavirus resurgence would be a huge burden on the NHS and given that we do have a way of reducing the impact of flu with vaccination, it is something to be considered.”Alastair Buxton, director of NHS Services at the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, said some countries, such as Australia, had already witnessed higher demand for flu vaccines from people who wanted to protect themselves, adding that this flu season was going to bring “a very new set of challenges”.“Healthcare professionals will face the challenge of needing to find ways to vaccinate people safely in a socially distanced environment,” he said. “If there is a significant increase in demand for vaccination from eligible patients, we expect there will be pressure on vaccine supplies, and we are also concerned about whether there will be adequate supplies of the PPE that health professionals will need when administering vaccines.“Community pharmacy is already planning for the upcoming flu season, working closely with the NHS, so that priority groups for vaccination can get one. The complexity of the global supply chain for flu vaccines means manufacturers cannot increase supply at short notice and increased demand across the world will increase pressure on availability, but community pharmacists will work with GP colleagues to do all that they can to get their local communities vaccinated,” he added.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The flu vaccination programme will be a crucial part of preparing the UK for winter and jabs are already freely available to those most at risk, including people over 65, pregnant women, carers and primary school children. We plan for the flu season well in advance and further details will be published soon.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/328c81d0708774f53e794adb7f80ea4d8635cb80/0_159_5120_3073/master/5120.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a6f076f559940448dd201de1edf51b25","title":"talking horses hollie doyle picks up exciting spare ride for royal ascot horse racing tips","story":"The jockey, a prolific winner since racing resumed a fortnight ago, will be aboard the joint-favourite Win O’Clock in a Wednesday handicap at the prestigious Flat meetingFans of Hollie Doyle will be interested to learn that the in-form rider has picked up a very useful spare ride at Royal Ascot on Wednesday. The 23-year-old has been booked by Roger Charlton for Win O’Clock in Wednesday’s King George V Handicap, the 13-2 joint-favourite with most firms.“Bit of a last minute thing, he just got in the race, I think, so I was lucky,” Doyle said after racing on Sunday. “Great ride to pick up from Mr Charlton. I haven’t had a chance to speak to anyone about it yet, I only heard today.”Win O’Clock was ridden to a recent success by Jason Watson but has only eight stone to carry in Wednesday’s race, which is lighter than Watson generally does.Doyle came close to Royal Ascot success a couple of years back when second in the Sandringham aboard Ortiz. Making the most of your opportunities is the key when it comes to big weeks like this one and she certainly did that, as Ortiz was a 66-1 shot. Unfortunately he bumped into a well-treated and well-backed winner in Agrotera.Frankie Dettori and Ryan Moore soak up a large proportion of the best rides in Royal week. Last year they had 12 of the 30 winners between them, so it is hard for others to get a look-in, and of course it has been famously tough for female riders to get a win there, Hayley Turner becoming the first for 32 years when she won the Sandringham last year.Asked for a ride she’s keen on this week, Doyle mentioned her mount for one of the new races, Friday’s Palace Of Holyroodhouse Handicap. “I’m really looking forward to riding Maystar. He’s stepping back to five furlongs, which is going to be really quick for him, but he’s in good form and he always runs a big race.“He’s by Sepoy and they can be quite challenging sometimes but we’ve never had an issue with him. He showed a little bit of temperament in the gates last time but that should be under control this time.”“It’s good to be back,” she says. “Physically, I feel absolutely great. The driving is tiring. It’s long days with 10-race cards and I’m riding out every morning. It is tiring but I can’t complain. It’s full on. But it’s got to be done.”Master Spy has become a non-runner at Goodwood, having cut his leg this morning, so we’ll have to wait to see if he really has landed on a decent mark for handicapping.In his absence, Lost My Sock (12.20) appeals in the opener at Pontefract. The chestnut was “nearest finish” and showed promise when third on his debut at Newcastle on racing’s second day back a fortnight ago. He comes from the Tim Easterby stable, whose runners generally benefit for a first outing, and should know a lot more this time. He is 7-4 from the opening 3-1.Later, there has also been support for Kaylen’s Mischief (3.55), down to 6-1 favourite. He had a productive summer on turf for a new yard last year, most recently scoring at Chepstow in July, and is only 4lb higher here. There has been some variety to his tactics but he generally goes forward and he is well placed to do that from stall three.There are more likely winners at Kempton tonight but Monsieur Fox (7.05) is in danger of being underestimated at 20-1.

Facebook apologised to the user late on Friday and restored the post.A spokeswoman for Facebook said the photo was removed by the automated system in error.“We apologise for this mistake,” she said.However, dozens of  readers have since reported that when they tried to post a link to the article on their profiles they received message that the post violated the same community standards.The man who first posted the image to his profile was among those unable to share the news article.Several readers were even banned from posting on Facebook for up to 30 days for attempting to share the article.After further inquiries from  Australia Facebook appeared to allow the article to be posted on Monday afternoon.Facebook typically allows users to request a review of any takedowns. Between January and March it restored 613,000 pieces of content after 2.1m requests for review.Several people pointed out the disparity between Facebook quickly (and incorrectly) censoring content it believed to contain nudity and its reluctance to take action against Donald Trump’s inflammatory posts.The journalist and activist Cory Doctorow said on Twitter the incident showed Facebook could not moderate at scale, and that automated moderating was not evenly distributed, with some minority groups more likely to have their discussions censored.Doctorow argued Facebook should not be given additional duties in censoring content, as some have called for in recent weeks over Trump’s posts on Twitter and Facebook. Instead, he said, Facebook should be cut down to a “size, to a scale where communities can set and enforce norms”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43d97a0a725b676c14f126b062828022b2e5dc46/0_0_5242_3146/master/5242.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f7d6ed6bb9bb55ea19787e47ad86dd99","title":"wetting yourself as an adult is the stuff of nightmares jenny eclair on bladder weakness","story":"The author and comedian lets loose on a wee problem many women are still too shy to talk about: accidental leakageThere are many reasons why you might wet yourself, but the best is laughter. I remember laughing so much at school that I frequently had to clutch my front bottom to stop the wee coming out. This was once triggered by the girl standing next to me farting very loudly during assembly – seriously, she let off as loudly as a trumpet at the precise moment we’d all finished singing a hymn. I still call this state of helpless incontinent hilarity “school assembly” laughter, and when I’m gigging, this is the Richter-scale level of laughter I’m after. I want to see every woman in the audience crossing her legs and clutching her front bottom.In real life, of course, wetting yourself as an adult is the stuff of nightmares, immediately you are the primary school pant wetter, the girl who had to borrow a pair of knickers from the lost property box, oh the shame of it.The fact is, losing control of your bladder can happen for all kinds of reasons, from simple timing issues, ie finding yourself locked out of the house and not being able to find your front door key, to suffering from various medical conditions that affect bladder control.For some reason, adult female incontinence still tends to be a taboo subject, although there probably isn’t a female comic who hasn’t gone through motherhood without making an “every time I cough, I wet my pants” stress-incontinence gag. A few years ago, during a Grumpy Old Women Live show, I performed some menopausal material about having a go on a kids’ trampoline: “Thirty seconds later, I’d pissed myself, broken both my ankles and one tit had escaped its moorings,” I joshed. And judging by the reaction of the audience, a great many of them had been there, done that and had to go home to change their underwear.In my experience, as long as we women are in control of the joke then we can laugh about it. It’s when other people (often younger and frequently male) take ownership of our physical frailties that it becomes embarrassing and somehow more shameful.For many women over 50, a little bit of leaking now and then is a fact of life – many of us haven’t got the toned pelvic floors we once had, thanks mostly to having big headed babies, and while some of us will never need to use pads, others feel safer with some protection, “just in case”.As a woman who has spent more than her fair share of time on the motorway sharing cars with other female performers, it has always surprised me how some women need to stop at a service station to use the loo every 20 minutes, while others manage a good five hundred miles without needing a wee.The fact is that all bladders are different, some resemble oversized leather footballs, while others, like my friend Nina’s (I’ve changed her name) are thimble sized and made from gossamer. Nina has never managed to make it to the interval of any show without climbing over everyone’s laps to get to the ladies.For a number of women, bladder training can be incredibly useful. A friend of mine swears blind that Princess Anne once informed her that “when one urinates, one must always sit for another 30 seconds after you think you’ve finished, as you inevitably haven’t, there’s usually a few drops more”. This is singly the best tip for anyone suffering from post-micturition dribble. Basically, slow down and give yourself time to do the job properly. Then “give your lettuce a good shake” as the old saying goes and remember to wipe from front to back, because we don’t want a yeast infection on top of everything else.Lord knows, women are born with complicated plumbing and as we get older some of our pipework can start to drip now and then, but you know what? Unless you’re wearing a gusset of galvanised steel, there’s no reason why anyone should know.Of course in the olden days women would rather die of shame than talk to anyone about bladder weakness, but one of the great things about being a 21st-century woman is that we know this kind of thing is common.So remember girls, incontinence is not a moral weakness, it’s not laziness, it’s a fact of life for millions, so whatever you do, keep laughing and don’t let a little bit of wee spoil your fun.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

The first, deadly, wave is over but the economic and health consequences will likely shake the neighborhood for years to come. The toll the coronavirus has taken on the coincidentally-named Corona tells a story of race, poverty and inequality in modern America.“What we have seen is that some students who were high flyers, who were excellent students throughout the school year, have actually stopped handing in work or have been handing in minimal work,” Rojas said.\u0026nbspThe high school is on the border of Corona, home to the New York City zip code which has seen the highest number of deaths in the city, 392 , and the highest number of identified coronavirus cases: 4,014. Roughly 10 miles from whiter and wealthier Manhattan neighborhoods where there were almost no deaths from the illness, Corona sits at the crux of the economic and health toll Covid-19 has had on undocumented, Latino immigrant communities across the US.Nationally, Latinos are overrepresented among people who have caught the virus in 43 of the 44 states that provide information on the group, according to research by demographer Rogelio Sáenz for Latino Decisions.\u0026nbspDemocratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who represents the district, said Covid-19 “poured gasoline” on the neighborhood’s existing problems. And under the most openly anti-immigrant president in modern history, government negligence have left people struggling to get food and financial aid in a pandemic which has killed more than 110,000 Americans.\u0026nbspCommunity groups are filling in the gaps as best they can on tight budgets.And teachers like Rojas have seen their jobs shift to also include linking students and their families with food and rent assistance, while exploring the minutiae of government policy. On calls about grades, Rojas asks parents if they know how to access healthcare depending on their immigration status. “Because that’s what my students need more than a history lesson,” she said.\u0026nbspThe daughter of Colombian immigrants, Rojas was raised in Queens. The 28-year-old is housing relatives who rented rooms in apartments with people who had Covid-19. “For all of April, every day I was saying rest in peace to somebody,” she said.\u0026nbspCorona is often grouped together with Elmhurst, its demographically similar neighbor to its west. The main hospital for both areas is Elmhurst hospital – which saw an “apocalyptic” surge in coronavirus patients in March. On a hazy, hot weekday in early June, the streets winding through the neighborhood were filled with small groups of runners and multi-generation families walking dogs and pushing strollers along the neighborhood’s grand, green tree-lined streets. The constant sound of sirens in the preceding months had finally been exchanged for a soundtrack of chirping birds.\u0026nbspBut coronavirus still casts its shadow over the neighborhood. For more than a half mile along 57th Avenue people lined up for Covid-19 testing, some had brought out chairs and sun umbrellas to endure the long wait. Similar lines are evident at food donation centers in the neighborhood, with one stretching more than 20 blocks.\u0026nbspThe economic crisis from Covid-19 has put hunger centre stage for residents, whose homes are also some of the most crowded in the city. When New York closed down, it was essential workers from neighborhoods such as Corona who kept things running. “Family members may have remained at home this entire time, but if they have even just one person in the household that needs to work, that one person can bring back the virus,” Albrecht said.Another worrying factor for the long-term is that Corona has the most cases of uncontrolled diabetes in the city and people with diabetes have higher rates of serious complications and death from Covid-19.\u0026nbsp“The fact of that matter is the neighborhood, especially of Corona, is quite limited in terms of the resources,” Albrecht said. “Whether or not it looks bad now, the point is because of the limited resources in these neighborhoods, they are going to be experiencing a disproportionate number of deaths from here on and forward in the future, especially if there are no resources deployed to these neighborhoods to help minimize the impact of Covid.”\u0026nbspAlbrecht, an assistant professor at the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, said the early Covid-19 narrative was that it is “an equal opportunity virus and will impact all populations”. She said resources did not seem to be deployed with the special conditions in low-income or immigrant communities in mind.César has lived undocumented in the US since 1996 and learned a long time ago how to operate without the state’s support.  is withholding his last name because of his immigration status.\u0026nbspCésar said what his community needs most is clear communication and leadership from the government. Without it, he, his close friends and family have created their own support network.\u0026nbspIn weekly phone calls, or socially-distanced in-person conversations, he checks in to see what people need, then figures out how to get it.\u0026nbsp“Some places they have food, so what I do, is I share it in our community,” César said. “I call them, ‘what are you doing, what do you need?’ We try to help everyone.”\u0026nbspCovid-19 has impacted each facet of his life, he said. The 42-year-old hasn’t worked since 15 March, when the restaurant he worked at closed. His wife also lost her job and they have been draining their savings to help support their two daughters. “We have no money to pay the bills,” he said.\u0026nbspCésar said his inability to pay rent hasn’t been a problem yet because the building owner has been understanding.Legally, the owner doesn’t have a choice – New York City has a rent moratorium. But even before the pandemic, some landlords used tenants’ undocumented status to threaten them.Despite the myriad challenges, César was optimistic. “No matter what happened before or now, it is never too late to start again,” César said. “You gotta do what you gotta do.”Diana Moreno, worker rights director at the not-for-profit New Immigrant Community Empowerment (Nice), said many of their members were anxious to return to work, in part because of the international flow of people’s paychecks.\u0026nbspBefore the pandemic, Nice was focused on fighting worker exploitation and the lack of access to things such as affordable housing for members primarily in Corona, Elmhurst and Jackson Heights.\u0026nbspNow, it and other community groups have been thrust into the role of disaster relief agency. Volunteers described how they have scrambled to get food to hungry families and to navigate funeral arrangements for people born outside the US.\u0026nbsp“I didn’t think we would have to be in contact with the Mexican consulate to talk about repatriation of people’s remains,” Moreno said. “That is something that is now part of our jobs. ”\u0026nbspMoreno said the disaster-relief work she’s been doing eroded the progressive, immigrant-friendly reputation of New York City. “That has really for me, and I think a lot of people, lifted the veil of how the longstanding inequity is absolutely hitting our communities regardless of the particular reputation of a city or state,” Moreno said.\u0026nbspThat longstanding inequity is why the community group Centro Corona describes its current aid relief operations as a political movement, not charity. “It is building with people and letting them know their needs are valuable,” said Mauricio Piratova, a Centro Corona volunteer.\u0026nbspEarly on, Piratova said they realized an on-call doctor would be needed because so many people they work with don’t have health insurance. They’ve introduced activities like weekly, virtual movie nights for children and have moved their homework help programs to phone or video chat. They provide direct cash assistance for people facing eviction. And like at Nice, they are helping people transport remains from one country to another.\u0026nbsp“The city abandoned people of color and immigrant communities,” said Piratova. “And it shouldn’t be that non-profit organizations, little organizations with no funds, have to start doing things. It shouldn’t be the reality we are living. What we need is basically essentials, we need food available for everyone. If you’re telling people they can’t go out, they can’t go to work, just give them food.”Even with these efforts to help, people are slipping through the cracks.\u0026nbspHundreds of indigenous and minority languages are spoken in Corona and an analysis by the Endangered Language Alliance found the city’s most multilingual communities have been most affected by the virus.\u0026nbspCorona is one of the most linguistically erse parts of the city – in part because a wave of migration from Mexico, Guatemala, Ecuador and Peru to New York City in the 1990s included a substantial Indigenous population.\u0026nbspA study ELA published with the city health department in 2019 found that while indigenous Latin American communities were substantial and growing, they “often remain dispersed, invisible, and without access to services”.Don, a 51-year-old undocumented immigrant, like César is from an indigenous community in Pueblo, Mexico, and speaks Spanish as well as Nahuatl, which was spoken by the Aztecs.He said he’d heard about food assistance programs but the demand was so high that his family was not expecting any help soon.\u0026nbspHe has lived in Corona for about eight years and shares an apartment there with his three brothers and four young nieces and nephews. With each adult in the family’s hours cut or work shut down all together, the family is struggling to get food. “It is difficult because we can’t tell our kids if we are not going to eat or if we are going to eat,” Don said, through a translator.\u0026nbspThough he’s worried about getting sick, all he wants is more work.\u0026nbsp“Rent is not going to wait for us,” Don said. “That’s what’s more worrying for us.”\u0026nbspCuomo said in early May that there would be no additional Covid-19 assistance for undocumented immigrants without federal funding after California established its own $125m fund to aid undocumented people in the state. New York state’s department of health said it had opened two testing sites in Corona and other low-income, minority neighborhoods hard hit by the virus. It has also given $25m to food pantries and provides services at no cost in multiple languages. The pandemic has not halted the Trump administration’s attack on immigrant communities.\u0026nbspUndocumented people don’t qualify for unemployment aid or the federal stimulus checks and because of their status, their US citizen spouses are also denied the assistance. It took a month for authorities to clarify that immigrants seeking permanent residence wouldn’t be penalized if they sought treatment and testing for Covid-19. The government has ignored public health warnings to take people out of immigration detention, where they are held on civil immigration violations, not criminal charges. The spread of coronavirus in Guatemala has been directly tied to US deportation flights.This oppression isn’t lost on the students in Rojas’s US history class, who ended the school year learning about the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s.\u0026nbspRojas said one standout essay this semester drew parallels between the century-old Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire – which claimed the lives of 146 workers, mostly young women who had recently immigrated from Eastern Europe –\u0026nbspand the lack of PPE made available to essential workers. Another student connected race riots which followed the first world war to the New York Police Department’s over-policing of communities of color to enforce social distancing guidelines.Students managed this work from crowded apartments and while caring for younger brothers, sisters and cousins. Some had only just got internet access at the end of May. Rojas hopes in-person classes return in the fall, so she knows students have access to two meals per day and a safe learning environment.\u0026nbspRojas said: “Even as a historian, I did not expect this amount of neglect”\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7335c8af40c0db99992784384dc252fd2f9082d/0_422_4803_2884/master/4803.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50db62e825dbc7ee4dc2f3b949b35efd","title":"tell us how has coronavirus affected people living in the north east","story":"We’d like to hear from people in the north-east and Yorkshire about the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreakWe would like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.We’d like to hear from people in north-east England including the county of Yorkshire and we’re particularly interested finding out how the pandemic has affected your work and the local economy.

Boris Johnson said on Sunday that the falling numbers of coronavirus cases has given the government “more margin for manoeuvre” in easing the 2-metre physical distancing rule.In response to data showing the government had failed to trace the contacts of a third of those testing positive in the first week of the new system, Kluge warned in an interview with the  against rushing into reopening the economy.The WHO official said the tracking in England of about 31,000 contacts of 8,000 infected people was encouraging and a cause for congratulations. But he added that Downing Street needed to be convinced it could “aggressively” track infections as the prime minister looks to reopen the economy.As of Saturday there were 41,662 deaths in the UK – a daily increase of 1,425 confirmed cases and 181 deaths.Governments who locked down early in the pandemic, in the face of public criticism, had recorded fewer deaths during the pandemic, Kluge said, but European leaders would now be judged on their management of their exit from the restrictions.“We know that early lockdowns saved lives and bought some time for the health system to be ready,” Kluge said when asked about the British government’s record. “But I would rather than instead of looking to the past, jump to the future and say that the question of lifting the lockdown is as important as going to the lockdown. The key words here are to do it gradually. Do it carefully.On Thursday, Dido Harding, the chair of the NHS test-and-trace service, admitted that the UK’s scheme – billed as “world-beating” by Boris Johnson – would need to improve.Of the 8,117 positive cases referred to contact tracers, 5,407 had been willing to hand over the names and phone numbers of people they had met in the previous two days. Despite the stumbling start and the lack of a promised coronavirus app slated for launch by the end of May, Johnson is under growing pressure from Conservative backbenchers to push on with lifting the lockdown amid grim forecasts of mass unemployment.“We know that the situation in the UK is still being taken very seriously,” Kluge said. “But we also know that it is a balance between three factors: population health, economic and social, and the third is the wellbeing of the people. So whatever the country decides: be ready. It is not over. And whatever decision you make, please make sure it is based on public health and epidemiological observations.”Kluge said international comparisons were difficult but that the pandemic had shown the importance of governments being able to communicate effectively with the public to convince them of the necessity of respecting the unprecedented nature of the requests being made.Noting that Downing Street had delayed going into lockdown in early March for fear that the population would fail to follow the rules with rigour as the restrictions dragged on, Kluge said: “What is the lesson there? Keep people engaged.”Kluge said he could understand the government’s caution despite calls from senior Conservatives, including the former leader, Iain Duncan Smith, for a rethink on the 2-metre guidance. Johnson has ordered a review of the policy to be completed by July.“Every country has their own context, based on a risk assessment. In the UK I would say this is a very active phase in the pandemic so, more let’s say, careful,” he said. “There is no right or wrong. Of course, ideally, it would be everywhere the same but countries are doing this based on their own risk assessment …“Whether it’s one or two metre is less important than the fact that people will adhere to the measures, to the physical distancing, to the handwashing, to the respiratory hygiene, and that they understand that it’s not over. This is the key issue.”With Europeans eyeing up the potential of summer holidays, Kluge said Europe as a whole could not be complacent, with infection rates increasing in the past fortnight in Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and North Macedonia. The Europe region within Kluge’s remit is made up of 53 countries: the UK, the member states of the EU, and the countries of central and eastern Europe including Turkey and Russia.The reopening of schools had led to some local flare-ups in Europe that were swiftly contained, Kluge said, and the continent could face a deadly combination of a second wave of coronavirus and an influenza pandemic in the autumn.“We call it when ‘Covid will meet the flu’,” Kluge said. “The issue is that several epidemics can go together and how do you have policies in place? We put an expert group together to look at that because no one has the ideal answer.”Kluge said it would be crucial for governments to distribute the influenza vaccine among the groups most vulnerable to Covid-19: older people, men, and generally people with underlying conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and renal disease.There are 135 potential vaccine candidates for Covid-19, of which 10 are in clinical trial. Kluge said it “may well take a year, a year and a half now” before a vaccine could be ready. “My understanding is that it’s still a bit early in the day. Of course one thing is efficacy, but then the other one is safety … We are hopeful and there’s a lot of effort. But, until that moment, let’s implement what we know works.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8914dbaaf1a13e319fc85c5a4665a27f9ad9eb01/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1d0f675e7244c3693cfb574d28daccb","title":"france turning page as schools borders and workplaces reopen emmanuel macron coronavirus","story":"President Macron announces mandatory return to class following lockdown and plans to boost economyEmmanuel Macron has announced that France is open and back in business.In his fourth televised address to the nation since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the French president said the country was “turning the page on the first act of the crisis that we have gone through”.“The fight against the epidemic is not over, but I am happy that we have won this first battle against the virus,” he said.Macron opened by saying the whole of France, except for the overseas departments of Mayotte and French Guiana, were “turning green”, meaning restaurants, bars and cafes in the Paris area can now fully open, and that all schoolchildren except for those in lycées (upper high schools) will be expected to return to class from next Monday.With the academic year due to end for the two-month summer holiday at the beginning of July, the announcement that the return to class is obligatory has come as a surprise to many parents and headteachers in areas where secondary school classes are currently closed.Macron also announced France’s Schengen borders would be open as from Monday and its non-EU borders from 1 July.“We can be proud of what we have done in our country. Of course this challenge has also revealed weaknesses, fragilities, our dependence on other continents to procure certain products, our cumbersome organisation, our social and territorial inequalities … I would like us to learn all the lessons from what we have been through,” Macron said during the 20-minute address.He said the country was facing an economic crisis, but stated while coronavirus easing measures had cost the country €500bn, there would be no tax rises. He suggested plans for France’s economic reconstruction would include encouraging firms to relocate back to France and plans for economic “independence” that he would announce next month.At EU level, the president called for the consolidation of an “economically independent Europe” to take on the US and China.Macron made no direct reference to the widespread but largely peaceful anti-racism and anti-police violence protests in France at the weekend, sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in America, but said “racism, anti-semitism and discrimination are unacceptable”.However, he warned there would be no rewriting of French history.“I will be very clear tonight, compatriots. The republic will not erase any name, any trace of its history. It will forget none of its artworks.

It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.“This challenge has also revealed weaknesses, fragilities, our dependence on other continents to procure certain products, our cumbersome organisation, our social and territorial inequalities,” he said. “I would like us to learn all the lessons from what we have been through.”Germany also opened its borders to fellow European travellers, but the government – which helped fly 240,000 people home as the pandemic grew exponentially – warned people to be careful as they planned their summer holidays.“My appeal to all those who travel: enjoy your summer vacation but enjoy it with caution and responsibility,” said the foreign minister, Heiko Maas. “Over the summer holidays, we want to make it as difficult as possible for the virus to spread again in Europe.”The appeal came as 10,900 German tourists began arriving in the Balearic islands as part of a pilot scheme to help Spain reactivate its crucial tourist industry.On Sunday, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, announced the country would reopen its borders to visitors from the EU and the Schengen area from Sunday 21 June.At the request of the Portuguese government, the land border with Spain will not open until 1 July, when Spain will open its border to travellers from other countries.Sánchez also called for caution in his televised address. “As you know, the threat of the pandemic remains present,” he said. “The pandemic isn’t over – a quick look at what’s happening right now in North America and South America show us that it isn’t.”Italy – one of the European countries hardest hit by the pandemic – reopened its borders on 3 June, but others are adopting a more targeted approach.Greece’s two main airports - in Athens and Thessaloniki – reopened to arrivals on Monday and the country plans to reopen its borders to the majority of European tourists, as well as those from certain other parts of the world, including Australia, Japan and New Zealand.However, anyone from a region particularly badly hit by the virus will have to undergo mandatory tests and spend their first night on Greek soil in a designated hotel. These include the Paris region, Madrid and Italy’s northern Lombardy region, among others.Switzerland is keeping its border with Italy closed, and Norway is doing the same with Sweden, whose virus strategy avoided a lockdown but produced a relatively high per capita death rate.On Tuesday, Austria – which has already opened its borders to most of its neighbours – will drop travel restrictions on a total of 31 countries, but has excluded Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the UK.The Czech Republic is also allowing free travel with a number of European countries from Monday, but restrictions are still in place with those deemed a risk due to their levels of coronavirus infections.Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Slovakia and Slovenia have also already begun to lift restrictions for foreigners entering their countries but excluded those from nations they deem as not safe – in many cases that list includes Sweden and the UK.Britain, which left the EU in January but remains closely aligned with the bloc until the end of this year, only last week imposed a 14-day quarantine requirement for most arrivals, horrifying its tourism and aviation industries.As a result, France is asking people coming from Britain to self-quarantine for two weeks and several other nations are not even letting British tourists come in during the first wave of reopenings.With flights only gradually picking up, nervousness about fresh outbreaks abroad, uncertainty about social distancing at tourist venues and many people facing record unemployment or pay cuts, many Europeans may choose to stay home or explore their own countries.The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and her Austrian counterpart, Sebastian Kurz, are both planning to holiday in their homelands this year.“If you want to be really safe, the recommendation is still a vacation in Austria,” the country’s foreign minister, Alexander Schallenberg, told ORF television. He reminded people of the scramble in March to bring home thousands of tourists as borders slammed shut.“In Austria, you know that you don’t have to cross a border if you want to get home, and you know the infrastructure and the health system well.”The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/247d4f4ab612acde2331baf520179f7d4e015182/0_253_5027_3016/master/5027.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c002ecd5c51a8d61a32b864a9fe99e6c","title":"married people report higher anxiety levels during lockdown","story":"Survey finds people married or in civil partnerships feeling more anxious than single peopleMarried people and those in civil partnerships have reported the highest rise in anxiety levels during lockdown, according to a study by the Office of National Statistics.The study noted that married iniduals were more likely to be balancing homeschooling alongside other commitments, with one in four people homeschooling during the pandemic, compared with approximately one in 10 who are single, separated or orced.It also noted that feeling lonely was the factor most strongly associated with reporting high anxiety – people who “often or always” felt lonely were almost five times more likely to report higher levels of anxiety than those who said they “never” felt lonely.Those aged 75 and over were almost twice as likely as those aged 16 to 24to report high levels of anxiety during lockdown, reversing trends prior to lockdown.In April the UK government set out these five tests it said had to be met before they would consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions:For people reporting high anxiety during the pandemic, more than one in five said that their work had been affected because they were finding working from home difficult.“Another marked change is in those aged 65 years or older. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic we consistently saw lower anxiety ratings in those aged 65 years and older, but now we are seeing the highest levels of anxiety amongst this group in lockdown.”However, levels of anxiety among Britons appear to be reducing compared with the start of lockdown, figures show.A separate ONS study found that up to half of people who are shielding from Covid-19 in England have left their home against advice, while a third have seen their mental health worsen.People who are shielding were initially told not to leave their home or garden, including for exercise, shopping or to go to work. On 1 June, the rules in England were relaxed to say people could leave their homes once a day for exercise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b35991f830fbf4005d5f0eadd5dfa015bdc13dc/0_157_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0bdff069c3cc3def64883634c664a9b","title":"only three out of 53 countries say us has handled coronavirus better than china","story":"Survey reveals deep global dissatisfaction with US leadership under Donald TrumpChina has beaten the US in the battle for world opinion over the handling of coronavirus, according to new polling, with only three countries out of 53 believing the US has dealt with the pandemic better than its superpower rival.The survey comes ahead of a major conference on the future of democracy this week, due to be addressed by the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, the former secretary of state John Kerry and the Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong. The conference is likely to be a rallying point for pro-democracy activists as China and the US enter an ever more explicit ideological contest.The 53-country survey of 120,000 people by the German polling firm Dalia Research and the Alliance of Democracies Foundation, an organisation headed by the former Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, reveals deep dissatisfaction with US leadership.EU foreign ministers will meet on Monday to discuss how far to take a more sceptical approach to China. There is a reluctance to enlist in an all-out trade war, and concern that the US is due to implement a law that will require companies to certify that their entire global supply chain – not just the part of the business that sells to the US government – is devoid of equipment from Huawei, the telecoms company ZTE corps, and other Chinese companies.Rasmussen, a former Danish prime minister, said: “Covid-19 is also a litmus test for democracy. Democracy is still alive in the hearts and minds of people across the world, but this study highlights a disconnect between citizens and their governments. It should act as a wake-up call to democratic leaders that people want more democracy and freedom after Covid-19.”Half of Americans and just over half of French, Italians and Belgians say their country is democratic. Every country surveyed shows a “democratic deficit” – a gap between the percentage who feel democracy is important and those who feel they live in a democratic countryThe Alliance of Democracies Foundation has previously conducted research on the extent of election meddling by authoritarian countries making recommendations on how social media companies could do more to shut down bots run by foreign governments.The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, on Sunday ruled out a transatlantic alliance against China a day before talks with Pompeo, and called for a “big, positive agenda for EU-China cooperation”.The meeting between Pompeo and EU foreign ministers is expected to focus on China and “disinformation”, and will be followed in a week’s time by the first EU-China summit under the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and European council president, Charles Michel. The two EU chiefs will meet the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, with the discussions expected to focus on market access.Borrell said the EU would not pick a side in the US-China conflict. “Amid US-China tensions as the main axis of global politics, the pressure to ‘choose sides’ is increasing,” he said. “We as Europeans have to do it ‘my way’, with all the challenges this brings.”He also admitted there were internal isions within the EU with some wishing to follow a policy of equidistance between China and Europe, and others urging Europe to align with the US.He said the transatlantic relationship remained vital for Europe – “the values we share form its bedrock” – but that it was strained by the Trump administration taking “unilateral decisions with which we do not always agree”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a86620c915a2f8dadb06b30384370bf0790b90e/1221_872_2424_1454/master/2424.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6cf7e71c52c9532ddae6180ec0769ab","title":"the stranded babies of kyiv and the women who give birth for money","story":"Lockdown exposed the scale of the commercial baby business in Ukraine, and now women hired for their wombs are speaking outSome are crying in their cots others are being cradled or bottle-fed by nannies. These newborns are not in the nursery of a maternity hospital, they are lined up side by side in two large reception rooms of the improbably named Hotel Venice on the outskirts of Kyiv, protected by outer walls and barbed wire.\u0026nbspThey are the children of foreign couples born to Ukrainian surrogate mothers at the Kyiv-based BioTexCom Centre for Human Reproduction, the largest surrogacy clinic in the world. They’re stranded in the hotel because their biological parents have not been able to travel in or out of Ukraine since borders closed in March because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Anxious parents check on the children they have not yet met via video calls, and others have sent audio recordings of their voices to soothe the children. BioTexCom released video footage from the hotel in mid-May to highlight the heartbreaking dilemma for parents and to lobby for an easing of border closures.The babies’ plight made headlines around the world,\u0026nbspbut a month on, some 50 babies remain in the hotel and the saga is casting a harsh spotlight on the ethics and scale of the booming commercial child-bearing industry in Ukraine.Mykola Kuleba, Ukraine’s ombudsman for children, has now said reforming a system he described as a violation of children’s rights was not enough and that surrogacy services for foreign couples in Ukraine should be banned.In a cash-strapped economy however, where the average wage is £300 a month and the war with Russia and its proxies continues, many impoverished women, especially in small towns and rural areas, are still lining up to carry babies for money, even if they are paying a heavy health and psychological price, as campaigners believe.In Vinnytsia, a city south-west of Kyiv, Liudmyla is still waiting to receive the balance of her fee for giving birth to a baby girl for a German couple in February. She regularly texts her surrogacy agency (not BioTexCom), which she says owes her €6,000. “They keep telling me they can’t send the entire sum because of the lockdown,” she says.\u0026nbspThough Liudmyla, 39, had an embryo transfer in Kyiv and spent most of her pregnancy in Vinnytsia, the agency asked her to travel to Poland to give birth so that the baby could be registered there. Hospital personnel were not aware that Liudmyla was a surrogate mother because commercial surrogacy is banned in Poland, as it is in most of Europe.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“I didn’t want to give her away, I was crying,” Liudmyla recalls. She says that after two days of caring for the infant in the maternity ward, letting her go was a wrench. “But I knew what it was all about.”\u0026nbspA shop assistant and a single mother, Luidmyla struggled for years to find a home for herself and her own three children that would be better than the one room in a hostel that they had. So in 2017 she went to a surrogacy clinic, and with the money she was able to take out a mortgage on an apartment. Even though she was placed in an intensive care unit as a result of complications in the pregnancy, Liudmyla decided to have a second surrogate baby to pay back most of the loan for the flat.\u0026nbspThere are no official statistics, but it is estimated that several thousand children are born to surrogate mothers in Ukraine each year.\u0026nbspEighty per cent of these babies are for foreign couples, who choose Ukraine because the process is legal and cheap.\u0026nbspSergii Antonov, a fertility lawyer, says Ukrainian surrogate agencies occasionally organise for the babies to be born abroad because this can make the birth registration process easier.The price of a surrogacy package in Ukraine starts from £25,000, with the surrogate mother receiving at least £10,000. Intended parents are generally required to be married heterosexual couples and to have proof of their infertility diagnosis. Surrogacy clinics and agencies place their ads in newspapers, on public transport or in social media groups.Tetiana Shulzhynska, 38, writes to such groups, trying to persuade women to stay away from surrogacy because she thinks some of them end up paying with their health or even their lives. “In a contract, they protect only babies, they don’t care about us,” she says, sitting on a bed in her tiny wooden house in Chernihiv, in northern Ukraine.\u0026nbspShulzhynska, a mother of two who used to work as a trolley bus conductor, went to a surrogacy clinic in 2013 because she desperately needed to pay back a bank loan. She was so broke that the clinic sent her money to buy the ticket to Kyiv.She agreed to carry a baby for an Italian couple, and within two months it turned out she had four living embryos in her womb. The biological family decided to keep only one and the rest were removed surgically. In May 2014 Shulzhynska gave birth to a baby girl, which she gave away to the parents. She received a fee of €9,000.\u0026nbspSeven months later she went to a hospital with severe stomach pain. Doctors diagnosed cervical cancer. It took her almost a year to raise money for surgery. Shulzhynska suspects the cancer was caused by her surrogacy, although there is no proof of this.\u0026nbspShe has recently ordered crutches because her doctors plan to amputate her left leg, which is now affected by the spreading cancer.In 2015, Shulzhynska filed a complaint against BioTexCom alleging damage caused to her health, which led to a criminal investigation that is ongoing.Yuriy Kovalchuk, a former state prosecutor whose office oversaw a series of criminal investigations into BioTexCom in 2018 and 2019, says at least three other women went to law enforcement after having their wombs removed following surrogate pregnancies organised by the company.He says other investigations involved allegations of fraud and even a human trafficking inquiry in 2016, after an Italian couple discovered in 2011 that the children they had taken home were not genetically related to them. Kovalchuk was removed from his post last year and believes the investigations into BioTexCom have stalled as a result. He wrote to the ombudsman’s office in May outlining his concerns about the clinic.At Hotel Venice, Albert Tochilovsky, the owner of BioTexCom, does not deny there were mix-ups with embryos during surrogacy procedures in 2011 that led to the human trafficking investigation.He blames the error on a lack of experience when the clinic was only a year old, and says: “I don’t think it was only us who used to make mistakes here. If someone starts checking DNA, there will be a lot of scandals.” \u0026nbspHe claims that in at least three cases parents rejected surrogate babies after they were born with health problems. The best-known of them is the case of Bridget, the daughter of an American couple, who was born in 2016 and now lives in an orphanage in Zaporizhia, in eastern Ukraine. “It was a tragedy for us,” Tochilovsky says.\u0026nbspThe company’s website advertises “the best surrogate mothers” and Tochilovsky denies mistreatment of any women or any fraud at his clinic. He dismisses Shulzhynska’s cancer claims as “nonsense” and says the firm gives contractual protection to surrogate mothers.Surrogate mothers are self-organising on social media, where they share advice and warnings about surrogacy agencies. Svitlana Sokolova, a former surrogate mother and now an activist at the NGO Strength of Mothers, which helps surrogates, says she started receiving more complaints about alleged mistreatment during the Covid lockdown. One group of women said their contract obliged them to keep having embryos implanted in their wombs for a year until they got pregnant. “Through this contract, the women became a kind of property,” she says.Maryna Lehenka, a lawyer at La Strada Ukraine, says the charity’s hotline gets around 100 calls a year from surrogate mothers complaining about the stress they experience after giving away babies or problems caused by the hormones they took to increase the chances of pregnancy. She recalls a case when a woman went into hiding in a village because she did not want to give away a surrogate baby. Lehenka agrees with the ombudsman that commercial surrogacy should be banned in Ukraine. Sokolova, who co-owns a surrogacy agency, argues instead for a proper legal framework that would protect the surrogates. “Otherwise, it will just go underground.”Despite pressure for regulation of the surrogacy business – there are several draft laws before parliament – experts and insiders doubt major legal changes will be made anytime soon to curb the baby business. Tochilovsky says that if commercial surrogacy became illegal, his clinic would just refocus on embryo donation.\u0026nbsp“The world’s future is in biotechnology, and most of the money will come into biotechnologies,” he says.Olga, 26, is going to have her second set of surrogate twin boys for a Chinese couple later this month. To give birth, she came to Kyiv from a town in north-east Ukraine along with her young son and husband, and was placed by the agency in a new flat within walking distance of the maternity hospital. Olga says she is feeling fine and she meets sometimes with three other pregnant surrogate mothers living nearby. Using the $17,000 (£13,500) she will get for the babies, Olga wants to open a coffee shop or a flower boutique back home. “I didn’t kill, I didn’t steal, I made this money in an honest way,” she says. Her son sits next to her he calls the expected babies “Kirusha and Kirusha”.\u0026nbspThe only worry Olga has is whether the biological parents will arrive before the twins’ birth. Otherwise, she will have to look after the babies until the parents come. Sokolova says some surrogates have ended up looking after their babies for months. She recalls one case where a surrogate mother adopted a baby after the biological parents rejected it at the last moment.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, new babies born to surrogates arrive at BioTexCom almost daily and are placed in the hotel’s makeshift nursery.\u0026nbspA group of Argentinian and Spanish couples, some of whom travelled before lockdown, were joyously united with their babies last week, but it is not yet clear when Ukraine’s borders will officially reopen and to which countries.Rafael Aires, from Spain, carefully takes his daughter Marta from the baby room to play with her. Aires arrived in Ukraine before the lockdown and has been held up for months, his wife back in Spain. But the complication has not tarnished the couple’s happiness. Aires had been trying for a baby for eight years. “And now,” he says, “ta-dam.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e995f2ab2e635127181319e0817f0b43b8eddd6a/513_1529_2644_1587/master/2644.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=990e6bad8c163a7e3b2bdb6908166613","title":"color is not a new york black lives matter street art in pictures","story":"Across the US, artists have responded to the death of George Floyd and the ensuing protests with impactful and urgent work.

Your explanation is you had 16 pints to drink, you hadn’t been to bed, and a group of football supporters were coming up to protect the monuments.The irony is rather than protecting the monuments, you almost urinated on one. That was more by luck than judgment. You showed no respect at the time for a man killed while protecting the Houses of Parliament.Music venue Colston Hall has removed lettering from the outside of its building ahead of a planned name change, PA Media reports. It was named after Edward Colston, the 17th century slave trader, and built almost 150 years after his death. Bristol Music Trust, which runs the venue, announced in 2017 that the name would be changed this year following a £49m refurbishment. The organisation said this morning that removing the lettering is “just one step on our road” to revealing the new name this autumn. The move comes after a statue of Colston was toppled and thrown into Bristol harbour during a Black Lives Matter march last weekend.We have taken this action as a symbolic moment and a public demonstration of the commitment we made three years ago to change our name.Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that levels of anxiety among Britons appear to be reducing compared with the start of lockdown.The ONS report on anxiety and coronavirus (which you can read here) states: The effect seen on average anxiety ratings throughout the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic shows a similar pattern to the theory of ‘hedonic adaptation’.When a shock event occurs, such as the impact of the coronavirus, wellbeing is temporarily impacted but people then quickly adapt so that wellbeing partially bounces back though not necessarily to the same level as it was before the shock.During lockdown, new measures have been put into place, which may have also helped to alleviate high levels of anxiety.David Isaac, chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, has said Boris Johnson should be taking action to address racial inequality instead of just announcing another inquiry. Echoing the point made by Labour (see 10.02am), Isaac said:We know the scale of the problems we face to tackle the entrenched racial inequality in our country. It is not new. There have been countless reports and the data exists exposing all the issues.Now is the time for urgent action. We need to see a clear and comprehensive race strategy with clear targets and timescales from government.We hope this new commission will help deliver that and we stand ready to work with it.A report by an influential group of MPs has said the Treasury should act to help more than a million people who have fallen through the cracks in the government’s Covid-19 income support schemes.’s Larry Elliott and Kalyeena Makortoff report that the all-party Treasury select committee said large numbers of people were enduring financial hardship as they were unable to benefit from the chancellor’s schemes for salaried employees and the self-employed.The committee said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, needed to make good on his promise to “do whatever it takes” to protect iniduals and businesses from the impact of the pandemic. The MPs called on Sunak to address the gaps in his coronavirus job retention scheme (CJRS) and self-employment income support scheme (SEISS).Employers across Britain face a deadline this week to make job cuts, as the furlough scheme is gradually wound down from August.The Scottish National party has announced that Amy Callaghan, the 28-year-old MP for East Dunbartonshire, is recovering in hospital following emergency surgery after collapsing at home with a brain haemorrhage last week.The party said it was linked to a manageable but unspecified medical condition, and the event could have longer-term consequences. Callaghan took the seat from Jo Swinson, the then Liberal Democrat leader, in a closely-fought contest in last December’s snap election.Amy is in good spirits and able to communicate well with family. She has been overwhelmed with the messages of support and kindness which are a huge source of encouragement. She has made great progress thus far but is under no illusion of the seriousness of her condition and the rehabilitation that will follow.In England non-essential shops are opening again today. Retailers were not sure in advance how many shoppers would turn up, but in some areas interest seems high. Here are some places where people have been queuing.Thousands more pupils are going back to school today, but the picture across the UK is patchy. At least parts of years 10 and 12 are returning to school to get some time with teachers ahead of their GCSEs and A-levels next year.The government has faced criticism that it has not done more to get schools reopened, with some children facing the prospect of having been out of the classroom for almost six months by the time they return in September.A No 10 source said Mr Johnson was “acutely aware” of the impact the extended closure was having on pupils and was working with the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, on a major “catch-up” plan.Here’s some pics of what some of those classrooms look like:In his Daily  article, which he has now posted on his Facebook page (perhaps to counter claims he was announcing government policy behind the  paywall), Boris Johnson says that the Black Lives Matter focus on statues is “a total distraction from the matter in hand”. That is a bit rich, given that his own article says much more about statues than it does about racial inequalities (a point that prompted David Lammy to accuse him of trying to provoke a culture war - see 10.22am). But the article also amounts to Johnson’s most extensive comment on an issue that has attracted huge interest in the last week, and so it is worth highlighting what he says. Here are the main points.I am also extremely dubious about the growing campaign to edit or photoshop the entire cultural landscape. If we start purging the record and removing the images of all but those whose attitudes conform to our own, we are engaged in a great lie, a distortion of our history – like some public figure furtively trying to make themselves look better by editing their own Wikipedia entry.This seems to fundamentally misunderstand the motives of those, for instance, who celebrated the removal of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol. They would argue that what amounted to “distortion” was a monument celebrating someone as a benefactor with no acknowledgement of the monstrous origins of his wealth.But, as David Lammy pointed out on Today, there is no serious campaign to remove the Churchill statute from Parliament Square in the first place and no one is calling for this beyond a small minority of activists (like Imarn Ayton, who was on the Today programme at the weekend). Johnson’s argument seems designed to curry favour with the Mail on Sunday, which yesterday launched a campaign to save the Churchill statue. As the Financial Times’ Robert Wright pointed out, that is about the safest newspaper campaign ever.Where will it end? Are we supposed to haul down Cromwell who killed so many thousands of people in Ireland? What about Nelson and all the other innumerable reminders of this country’s imperial past?Take the case of Ayuba Suleiman Diallo, whose portrait hangs in Room 15 of the National Portrait Gallery. He was a native of Gambia who was known and admired in 18th-century London as a translator of Arab texts. He was also, originally, a slaver himself. Does that mean he should be purged from the gallery?Rather than tear down the past, why not add some of the men and women – most often BAME – who helped to make our modern Commonwealth and our modern world? Isn’t that a more cheerful approach?That “cheerful” is very telling. One criticism of Johnson is that he has a fundamental aversion into facing up to anything negative.It is time for a cross-governmental commission to look at all aspects of inequality – in employment, in health outcomes, in academic and all other walks of life.We need to tackle the substance of the problem, not the symbols. Explained like this, it is hard to see how this might be different from the race disparity audit published by Theresa May in 2017.Up to half of people who are shielding from Covid-19 have left their home against advice, while a third say their mental health has worsened, according to new data. PA Media reports:But on 1 June, the rules in England were relaxed to say people could leave their homes once a day for exercise.The new poll across England, covering May 28 to June 3, found:Some 2.2 million clinically extremely vulnerable people have been advised to shield due to Covid-19.Long queues of people formed outside ZSL London Zoo in Regent’s Park, west London. Parents and children were asked to respect 2-metre social distancing and many wore face coverings.Jamie Turner, site manager for ZSL London Zoo, said just under 2,000 tickets had been sold for Monday and that the return of so many customers was “beautiful to see”.Visitors are being asked to keep “a tiger’s length” apart.In his Today interview (see 9.19am and 10.02am) David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, also accused Boris Johnson of making his  article mostly about Winston Churchill statue because the Tories want a “culture war” as a distraction from their policy failings on race. Lammy said:Do something. Change it. You’re in power. You’ve been in power for a decade. The governing bodies of 80 of the nation’s leading sports – including British Athletics, British Cycling and England Netball – have published an unprecedented statement saying they have not done enough to confront racism at all levels from grassroots participation through to the boardroom, our colleague Sean Ingle reports.In his Today programme interview this morning (see 9.19am) David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, said that if Boris Johnson were serious about wanting to address racial inequalities, he should implement the recommendations of the many reviews already sitting on shelves in Westminster instead of ordering a new inquiry. Helpfully, he itemised some of them, starting with a reference to the review he himself led into the way BAME people are treated by the criminal justice system. David Cameron appointed Lammy to head the review when he was PM, and it reported to Theresa May’s government inn 2017.I made 35 specific recommendations in the Lammy review (pdf). Implement them. There are 110 recommendations in the Angiolini review (pdf) into deaths into police custody. Implement them. There are 30 recommendations in the Home Office review (pdf) into the Windrush scandal. Implement them. Twenty six into Baroness McGregor’s review (pdf) into workplace discrimination. Implement them. That’s what Boris has to do. And the Black Lives protests can stop and we can get on with dealing with the coronavirus.There will be an an urgent question in the Commons on the 2-metre rule. Having repeatedly said that this is being regularly kept under review, ministers have now said a specific review of it is under way.Greg Clark, the Conservative chair of the Commons science committee, has tabled the UQ. He is asking Boris Johnson to respond, although it is very unlikely that he will. No 10 is much more likely to send another minister to the Commons to respond (which is allowed)."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4275395.1591779019!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"holidays at home embrace our weather eat chipper chips and buy wetsuits","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Do a bit of research and find the best chipper wherever you are going\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Don’t waste your holiday and the run-up praying for good weather. Don’t even think about it and just accept that it will be mixed. Photograph: Frank MillerThe  In the weeks ahead, Irish people will be holidaying at home in greater numbers than at any point since the 1970s when shorts were short and hair was permed. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and the shutting of borders and the grounding of virtually all flights in and out of Ireland, people with plans to travel overseas have had to look closer to home. With that in mind we thought it might be useful to try and conjure up some useful tips for holidaying at home for those people who might not have done it in decades.1. Why does it always rain on me?: Irish people tend to be just a little obsessed by the weather. We talk about it with enthusiasm and flair and worry about it endlessly. Who amongst us hasn’t spent hours on a grey summer’s day staring at impenetrable clouds wondering if that is a break in the gloom we can see and a sliver of blue sky far, far away. Bad weather and the fear of it is one of the main reasons we started leaving this country in our droves in the 1980s and 1990s when overseas travel became the norm rather than the exception. But we need to recalibrate our national psyche and change our mindset this year if we are to get the best out of whatever the gods throw at us. We need to be more like the Germans and the French and the Americans who come here and love the weather.So, don’t waste your holiday and the run-up praying for good weather. Don’t even think about it and just accept that it will be mixed. It won’t be horrendous, there are not that that many days in the summer when it rains non-stop, but nor will it be amazing. Whatever it is you will still be able to make the best of it.2. Appy talk: Staying with the weather, the days of staring at the sky wondering if the end is nigh for the rain have long since been confined to the dustbin of history. The weather app on your phone will be your friend this summer. It will give you real-time hour by hour information on the weather wherever you are in the country. Treat it like your bible. If it tells you that between 2pm and 4pm, the sun will shine or at least the clouds will part briefly, plan your time at the beach or in the great outdoors around that. If your phone tells you it will be nicer in the morning than in the evening, get up earlier and if it is due to be nicer in the evening than in the morning allowing yourself a lie in. And yes, we do appreciate that this makes it sound very much like we are obsessing about the weather. Old habits and all that.3. Wet, wet wet: When Pricewatch were a lad, beach days were all about weirdly tight and uncomfortable nylon action mad speedos and luridly coloured windbreakers to shield our sandwiches from the savage bite of the swirling sands. It doesn’t have to be like that and you can have a day of fun at the beach and in the water without wishing you were far away. Will the water be lovely and warm? Probably not. Will you spend hours playing in the sea? Not without getting hypothermia. Is a bracing dip in the wild Atlantic waves a wonderfully invigorating way to spend a bitesize portions of your summer? It absolutely is. And Ireland has come a long way since the 70s. Today we have wet suits. You can pick up cheap ones in supermarkets – we understand that Aldi will be selling them in the weeks ahead – and in dedicated outdoorsy shops. While spending €300 on four for an average sized family may seem like a lot, if they allow you to defy the weather gods and frolic in the waves for hours over the course of a fortnight’s holiday it will be money well spent.4. Indoor amusements: Before you leave do all the research you need into the indoor fun you can have wherever you are going. While the indoor options are somewhat limited this year for obvious reasons, there are things you will be able to do if you have to deal with a miserable day. There will be museums, libraries and heritage centres to visit. There might even be the odd play centre open too. The trick is to work out your options before you leave home so you can have a few things to hand when you wake up to sheets of rain hammering the roof of your caravan or hotel room. By being a bit organised in the days before you leave you will help you to avoid the “Jaysus, what on earth are we going to do now,” moment.5. Play schools: Don’t just pack the car with clothes and beachy stuff. Bring board games, jig saws and playing cards. If you were on holidays overseas you would most likely not be watching the telly of an evening so there is absolutely no reason to do so while on holidays at home. If you have children over eight and have yet to teach them the joys of poker, Blackjack or 25, then now is the time. They will thank you for it when they are older and winning money off their friends at late night poker schools or taking the bank to the cleaners in Vegas.6. Streams of gold: Okay, so, we know we said that a summer holiday was no time to be watching the television, but that does not mean you have to spend your staycation living like an Amish. Decide on maybe 10 movies that you would be happy to watch over the course of your holiday. Bring a laptop or tablet, hook it up to the TV wherever you are staying and then watch them at your leisure. You might want to download them if you are concerned that the quality of the broadband wherever you end up is not up to scratch. Carefully chosen movies are better than mindlessly watching repeats of Reeling in the Years. And we love Reeling in the years.7. Make rules: There is absolutely no point in banning children from using their devices while they are on their holiday, particularly if you are not prepared to live under the same rules. But do set limits on how and when devices can be used. And then stick to them. This is good for both adults and for children. Just because you are on holiday at home does not mean that you have to be checking your phone every five minutes or answering work emails. There will be times while you are on leave that you might not feel like you are on leave given the familiarity of the surroundings but your are, so take the time off.8. Drive: There was nothing that would fill the child Pricewatch’s heart with dread more than an adult uttering the phrase “Let’s go for a drive”. In this scenario, the adults would sit in the front of the car – usually chain smoking with the window’s rolled up against the rain – while the children would rattle around the back with not so much as a single seat belt between them. It was as foul smelling as it was boring. However, we have it on very good account from a colleague who routinely goes on summer holidays in Ireland that drives are fun things to do with children. “Just never describe it to them as a ‘drive’,” this colleague warned us. “It’s a trip to some alluring destination, a mysterious beach, the best ice cream parlour in the west.” That sounds like a fine idea to us.9. Eat: Take advantage of where you are by exploring all the best food the region has to offer. It might be something simple like new potatoes or strawberries bought off the side of the road in Wexford or lobster pushed straight from the coastal waters off the coast of Sligo. The key thing is to treat yourself this year and, if you can, spend more than you might while at home. You are on holiday at home but that does not mean you have to shop in Aldi or Lidl. By eating the nicest of food you can find from local suppliers you will not only be rewarding yourself, you will be making life a little bit easier for local retailers and food producers who have been absolutely hammered by the pandemic. And while we are on the topic of food, make picnics and include crisps in every sandwich. It is cheap and it is fun.10. Wear sunblock: The routine for a sun holiday tends to involve lathering everyone in sun cream before the day gets going. But we tend to be a bit more relaxed about it when holidaying at home for obvious reasons. But the sun that burns us when we are on a beach on the Costa Brave is the same sun that can burn us while we are on a beach in Connemara. And we have said this before and we will say it again, there is no need to get hung up on fancy brands of sun cream either. Most supermarkets stock their own creams and oils for a fraction of the price you’ll pay elsewhere and according to consumer magazine Which? – they’re just as good as all the rest.11. Crosstown traffic: When the sun shines in Ireland many of us will decide to take a spontaneous trip to the beach. That is all fine and dandy until you find yourself watching the day pass you by while you are stuck in traffic. So, no matter what part of the country you find yourself in the weeks ahead, before you race off to the beach, take a moment to look at Google Maps. You won’t be looking for directions – you will probably be able to make your way to the local beaches unaided – but what you are looking for is traffic congestion. The software uses some class of sorcery to establish how bad the traffic is on whatever route you fancy in real time. A 90 second look may save you spending two hours of a rare sunny day stuck in traffic jams swearing at fellow drivers and shouting at your children.12. The tide is high, or is it?: Oh, and in case you forget – like Pricewatch has done far too often – unlike the Mediterranean, the waters around Ireland are tidal and can be dramatically so. So before you race off to the beach for a bracing dip, check where the water’s edge is likely to be. The Irish Tides and Tidal Ireland apps will be able to help you out.13. Keep it fun: “Are we there yet?” “I’m thirsty.” “I need to go to the toilet.” “Juliette scratched me.” “I can’t find my Elsa doll.” Kids are brilliant but cross-country journeys can be long and trying. If you’re taking a road trip with smallies plan some games in advance so you’re not left thinking up things on the fly. Here are three that might work. There is I Spy (obvs) - top tip: ban things that were outside the car for half a second as you sped along a motorway. Road Trip Bingo is always a winner but it takes prep. Print out bespoke bingo cards and give each player a pencil. When they see something on their card, they scratch it out. The more items you have on the card the less time they have to fight. With I’m Going on a Picnic, the first player says, “I’m going on a picnic and I’m bringing . . . an apple” or something else that begins with A. The second player repeats what the first person said, but adds something that begins with B. And on it goes. Make the prizes substantial to keep interest levels high.14. Book smarts: If you can’t think of any games to play or if the level of interest is low, download some audio books and everything will be golden. A David Walliams book read by the author himself or a Harry Potter read by Stephen Fry will see many journeys fly by. If you have older people in a car and want something hilarious to listen to, we couldn’t recommend the books of David Sedaris highly enough.15. Chipper chips: Do a bit of research and find the best chipper wherever you are going. Chipper chips, bread, butter and a cup of tea is a summer meal sorted. If you are really fancy you can throw in some mushy peas some battered cod and maybe even a pint of stout. You won’t get the like of it anywhere but home."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Irish Wind Energy Association: policy decisions key to pricingHomeowners want to radically improve their homes, says Tipperary Energy AgencyStudents would only be able to attend one or two days a week if rule not changed, says Minister"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Avian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: iStockA “large increase” in rats leaving the sewers and infesting city streets and suburbs has emerged during the coronavirus pandemic as pest control teams have been curtailed, Dublin City Council has said.Rats, described by one councillor as big enough to “put a saddle on”, are eating through brickwork and circumventing traps to infest homes, gardens and even cars.Recent warm weather, fewer people on the streets and increased illegal dumping had encouraged more rats into the open, the council said. However its ability to tackle infestations had been reduced as the Health Service Executive (HSE) pest control services were restricted during the pandemic.Sinn Féin councillor Daniel Céitinn said south inner-city residential areas around York Street, Montague Court and Bishop Street were becoming overrun with rats.“They are nesting in broken drains and seem to be becoming more aggressive in their search for food. They’re also getting into cars and ruining the engines,” he said. “I understand resources are scare at the moment, but not dealing with this is creating another health emergency.”SuburbsInfestations were multiplying in the suburbs too. Fianna Fáil’s Racheal Batten said there were particular problems in estates around Beaumont. Reduced activity during Covid-19 restrictions “seems to have given them a better chance to breed”, she said.Independent councillor Noeleen Reilly said there were similar problems in Ballymun. “I’ve never seen illegal dumping as bad, and that is definitely leading to an increase in rats.”The council said there had been “a large increase in the number of rats coming up from the pipe networks and onto the streets” and “we had instances where rats had eaten through brickwork in manholes and somehow managed to get by trap gullies on the roadways”.PoisonsControlling the rat populations was becoming increasingly problematic because of stricter regulation of poisons and because rat “enforcement action” was a matter for the HSE.“During the Covid-19 crisis, the HSE did not carry out pest control in our flat complexes, as they did prior to the pandemic. In the absence of the HSE, Dublin City Council continued to provide this service, which placed additional strain on our resources,” the council added.The HSE said it had been restricted on entering homes during the pandemic, but had continued to provide external “rodent control”.

Photograph: Eric LukeShopping centres are to reopen on Monday, and people can resume visiting loved ones in nursing homes and residential care facilities as the restrictions aimed at suppressing the coronavirus continue to ease.“We’re expecting queues outside some retailers and we’ll be monitoring footfall in the centre overall,” a spokeswoman for Dundrum Shopping Centre in south Dublin said.If it is felt there are too many people in the centre, then people will be asked to queue outside. “But we’re hoping it won’t come to that.”People entering the shopping centre will be asked to walk in using a “one-way system” and will be encouraged to wear face masks.Like many other shopping centres, some of Dundrum’s outlets, such as supermarkets, opticians and pharmacies, were already open, but now fashion outlets and other shops will be reopening.Restaurants will not be providing “dining in” services and cinemas in the centre will remain closed.The National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) has published a Shopping Centre Recovery and Protection Guide which says that centres should put in place measures that would limit the number of shoppers at any one time, and consider adjusting their opening hours so as to guard against over-crowding.Face masksIt says signs should be put up to encourage the wearing of face masks, that non-essential facilities, such as playgrounds, should either be closed or controlled, and public wifi should be switched off to discourage people coming into the centres.The Government had originally not envisaged reopening shopping centres until August 10th.A phased introduction of visits to nursing homes and residential care facilities is also starting from Monday. Non-essential visits have been banned since early March.“Families and friends across the country are counting down the minutes until they can visit and see, in person, their loved ones in nursing homes and residential care facilities,” said a spokesman for Sage Advocacy, which campaigns for vulnerable people and patients.People are being advised to contact the facilities they want to visit, prior to doing so. Visits to facilities where there is a Covid-19 outbreak are not being allowed.People who have any symptoms of Covid-19 infection or are feeling unwell, and people who have been told they are a close contact of someone confirmed as having Covid-19, should not visit residential facilities.Visit conditionsThe advice is that each resident should have only two named visitors, with only one of those people visiting at any one time, each visit being for a maximum of 30 minutes, one visit per person per week being allowed, and children under 16 years not being allowed visit.It is also advised that the residential facilities ensure that each facility sets a limit on the number of visitors that can be in the facility at any one time.“Visitors are required to wear a surgical mask if they are not able to maintain social distancing during the visit. “This surgical mask will be provided by the facility and its disposal will be monitored.”The bringing of food and drinks to the facilities is being prohibited and the use of the bathroom facilities in the centres is being discouraged.The EU’s home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, last week suggested that member states might begin to reopen their borders from as early as this week. But the advice for people in the State continues to be that they should avoid unnecessary travel.“We are still advising you should stay within your county, or 20km of home,” a spokesman for the Department of Health said.People, including Irish citizens, who enter the State from outside Ireland, are still expected to self-isolate for 14 days.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Our Shared Future deal promises \u0026lsquothe best thinking\u0026rsquo from Fianna F\u0026aacuteil, Fine Gael and the GreensMan died after 27 days on a ventilator, CUH doctors sayHSE rat-control services have been curtailed during the coronavirus pandemicMan struck by car which failed to stop at scene of incident at Windyhall roadAround 86 million Europeans including 19 million living in povertyGarda\u0026iacute discovered a man aged in his 40s with a stab wound at Ballybane on SundayDrinks industry charity Drinkaware expresses alarm about excess alcoholInitial results expected in late August to measure prevalence of virus in populationStrict protocols apply to retail outlet customers and visitors to residential facilitiesThe three party leaders remain locked in tense negotiations on final details of coalition dealFormer master Peter Boylan has written to board seeking objection put on agenda\u0026lsquoIf people are too ill to provide details, we find out who they are and who needs to be contacted\u0026rsquoPassport office drastically curtailed services as staff erted to pandemic tasksBiggest increase in incarceration in decade as more being jailed for not paying fines\u0026lsquoYou could in all probability say it\u0026rsquos down to the Covid diet,\u0026rsquo says Carlow dentistNBRU calls for a night time commission to facilitate socially distanced 24-hour societyBelongTo survey reports high levels of suicide ideation, self-harm and lonelinessSeveral outstanding issues remain unresolved after meeting between party leadersIncident took place on Saturday night on N5 at Belleek, CastlebarThree party leaders to meet on Monday morning to formally sign off on documentStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4279043.1592169937!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"draft programme for government the main points","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA new scheme will seek to retrofit 500,000 homes by 2030 on a ‘aggregated’ model – meaning that certain towns or areas will be retrofitted at the same time to achieve economies of scale.

Photograph: Alan BetsonOn numerous occasions, the three sides bickered at each other in the talks and in the media for several days. The Greens blamed Fine Gael for cancelling meetings. Fianna Fáil blamed the Greens. Fine Gael complained that the Greens were holding up the talks by refusing to sign off on policy papers that had been agreed by negotiators while the Greens accused the two bigger parties of trying to push them into a deal without spelling out the detail sufficiently.One Saturday session two weeks ago, largely dealing with economic issues, did not go well. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil pressed for agreement on a commitment to reduce the budget deficit in the later years of the government’s term once the cost of dealing with the pandemic had been absorbed but to the Greens – especially for its finance spokeswoman Neasa Hourigan – this sounded too much like a return to austerity.The following Saturday, June 6th, after a bruising day, those around the table at another lengthy plenary session stared goggle-eyed at their phones as news filtered through that Catherine Martin had confirmed she would challenge Eamon Ryan for the Green party leadership.One source expressed astonishment, but also a degree of grudging admiration for Martin, as she proceeded with the talks unfazed while all around her digested the news. Still, as they headed into the final week of talks, many people in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael thought: That’s it. She’ll never back a deal now.While Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil found themselves on the same side of many of the arguments about policy, there was still significant tension between the two parties. One senior figure in Fine Gael complained that Fianna Fáil just wanted his party to help entice the Greens in to government at any cost. But it was a “totally different environment” in his party. Lots of people weren’t enthusiastic about entering government at all.Deep pessimismAmid deep pessimism on all sides, the three party leaders held a long and productive meeting on Sunday, June 7th, acknowledging the difficulties and trying to find ways to work around them. One of them told his aides afterwards that they had identified “landing zones” for all the major issues that were still outstanding.Among the negotiating teams, meanwhile, it became clear that Catherine Martin was going nowhere. Day after day, the Greens hammered away at the talks, slowly, painfully agreeing the policy details of the document that would become the draft programme for government. Martin gave little away in the negotiations, but told her colleagues that she wanted a deal, but only one that could pass a vote of party members, where a two-thirds majority was required.Progress was slow a deadline of last Tuesday became the latest of many to pass without agreement. But all the same, there was progress. Texts were being agreed. After some slow and frustrating days, momentum swung towards a deal on Wednesday with broad agreement on how to reach the Greens ambition of reducing carbon emissions by an average of 7 per cent annually by 2030. A deal was getting closer.But not close enough. As the week went on, Fianna Fáil became more and more frustrated with what the party believed was foot-dragging in the negotiations. Senior party figures and negotiators were ided about who was to blame – the Greens or Fine Gael. But the nagging fear that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar would prefer a general election to a successful conclusion became more pronounced throughout the week, and as the talks dragged on at a glacial pace, Fianna Fáil became more anxious and more impatient. Senior party figures bridled at Fine Gael’s obvious enjoyment that Fianna Fáil was in a tight corner – but despite some sharp private messages sent to Fine Gael, they managed to keep a public lid on their frustrations.Friday deadlineFianna Fáil had wanted the talks concluded early in the week then they said it had to be wrapped up by Friday, insisting that ballot papers needed to be sent out to their members by the last post on Friday, but Fine Gael remained impervious to the Fianna Fáil demands. The Friday deadline came and went.On Saturday, Fine Gael turned up almost an hour late for the morning session that evening, after a long day, Simon Coveney proposed adjourning the talks until Sunday. By now the Greens were fed up no way, they said. Let’s get this finished tonight.The breakthrough in Saturday’s marathon talks session came at about 2 o’clock on Sunday morning, according to sources, when the Greens finally secured their demands on funding for transport: a 2:1 split in favour of public transport over roads and, even before that is calculated, that 10 per cent of the transport capital budget should be allocated to both walking and cycling. The combined 20 per cent works out at a guaranteed €360 million per year in cycling and walking infrastructure.Fine Gael’s Paschal Donohoe, Fianna Fáil’s Barry Cowen and Jack Chambers and Ossian Smyth and Joe O’Brien of the Greens hammered out a deal that cleared the way for the draft programme for government to be sent to the party leaders.The negotiators eventually finished at about 3.30am, having agreed text on all the remaining outstanding issues, bar those that had been kicked upstairs to the leaders to resolve.Pension ageVaradkar was still sticking to an increase in the pension age, an issue that had become more important for Fine Gael as the talks went on as a sort of badge of commitment for fiscal prudence – a contrast, they thought, to Fianna Fáil who were prepared to pay any price for a deal. But Fianna Fáil reminded Varadkar that he had already conceded the principle of postponing the pension age increase during the general election, even producing a report of him promising that cancelling the increase to 67 would be “the first legislation we put through the new Dáil” on February 3rd. In reality, Varadkar was using the pension age as a bargaining chip to get language about possible tax cuts in the future into the document. It remained the sticking point last night.For the Greens, the negotiating process also helped the parliamentary party bond as a unit. While some knew each other going back decades, others among the 12 party TDs and two Senators returned to Leinster House in the past few months had only a passing acquaintance.The coronavirus restrictions, with meetings held via video conference, didn’t help the group gel as it would have done normally, but the latter stages of the talks saw the parliamentary party in daily contact at internal preparatory meetings and the negotiating sessions themselves.For some, it was more than that. Waterford’s Marc Ó Cathasaigh and Limerick City’s Brian Leddin shared accommodation while in Dublin for the talks, as did Senators Pauline O’Reilly and Pippa Hackett. As a party, the Greens have made their bed. They now have to decide whether they want to lie in it.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4278848.1592142738!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"more than 30 000 passport applications to be processed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTens of thousands of passports would normally be processed each month in the run-up to the summer.There are more than 30,000 passport applications waiting to be processed by officials working within the Department of Foreign Affairs but the Passport Service has expressed confidence the backlog will be cleared within weeks.The service processed 12,000 passports last week alone and while there are still 32,000 applications in the system, a spokeswoman said most of them would be issued by early next month. The passport office drastically curtailed its normal services from the middle of March as hundreds of its staff were erted to work in other departments including Covid-19 contact tracing within the HSE and manning information lines for the Department of Social Protection. It did not, however, completely stop issuing passports and, alongside emergency travel documents which had to be issued, the office also processed thousands of adult renewal applications received online which required minimum staff intervention.“Once the potential impact of Covid-19 became obvious, contingency planning commenced to minimise the impact of restrictions on the delivery of passport services,” a spokeswoman for the Passport Service said. “In particular, plans were put in place to ensure that the Passport Service continued to provide an emergency service for the issuance of passports in cases of serious illness or death abroad.” She said that while staff were on-site processing urgent applications, they had also produced about 6,000 additional passports. However, tens of thousands of passports would normally be processed each month in the run-up to the summer, and the lockdown and the ersion of resources to other areas has led to the significant backlog. Full operationThe spokeswoman said it was “at an advanced stage of planning for the return to full operation” and she said that in phase two of the Government plans which started last Monday, the processing of non-essential online applications started to ramp up. “There are currently 32,000 passport applications in the system to be processed,” she said. “The Passport Service has a great deal of experience in dealing with peaks in demand and we believe that we are well placed to ensure the online service will be meeting its usual turnaround times of approximately two weeks for simple applications by phase three” which is now set to start at the end of this month.

Photograph: National Library of IrelandFlickr CommonsThe end, for Victoria, wasn’t particularly dignified.“As I watched, another workman appeared, clambering over her head, gripping her sometimes by the nose and occasionally sticking a finger into her disdainful eye. Perhaps it was just the effect of the glistening rain on the bright, green copper, but it seemed to me that the old lady - never exactly pleasant-looking at the best of times - was glaring about with loathing and disgust.”So reads an account in The  of the removal of the controversial statue of Britain’s Queen Victoria that stood for more than 40 years at Leinster House.The scenes are described in the Irishman’s Diary of the following day, July 23rd, 1948. She’s depicted on the front page, too - suspended by machinery as people look on. “Ministers, ex-Ministers and Dáil deputies stood around in the rain, waiting. There were crowds on the steps of the Museum and the Library and there were cameras everywhere. Meanwhile the workmen worked away with that maddeningly measured, deliberate air of men who know that they hold stage.“Several times we thought the big moment had come - once she did lurch from her pedestal for a second or two and creak back again - but just as everything was adjusted it would start to pour and everyone would have to rush for shelter.”In the end, Quidnunc missed the finale. “For a while longer I watched the men adjust and readjust the girths around Victoria’s middle then I had to go up to the Leinster Bowling Club to see the South African match. When I returned, Victoria was missing from her pedestal.” The statue was later moved to Kilmainham.The piece - comical, yet dry and straightforward - unflatteringly describes an audience and spectacle much different to that on the day the statue was erected.‘Mutilated’Searching for references to Dublin’s statue of Queen Victoria throws up a couple of parallels in the archive of The . There’s the statue of Victoria erected in 1939 in Menton, France pushed into the sea when the Italians came during the second World War and later replaced. Further back, in November 1908, there was the “outrage” at the public gardens in the Indian city of Nagpur, where a statue of the queen was “mutilated the face daubed with tar and the nose and fingers broken.”In the years between Victoria’s visit to Ireland in 1900 and the unveiling of John Hughes’s statue in 1908, mentions of a public fund set up for its commission are plentiful. In the days before the unveiling, tickets for the ceremony were advertised - the price of admittance was one shilling, payable at the front hall of Leinster House. The aim, said one report, was to thin the anticipated crowd.The day she was unveiled - February 15th, 1908 - was, like the day she came down, punctuated by rain. “The ceremony was made the occasion of an imposing military display, but the lustre of the pageant was to some extent marred by a somewhat heavy shower which fell shortly before the formal part of the proceedings commenced,” reported The .Detachments of soldiers began to arrive from 2pm, for the unveiling at 3pm. “About 1,000 troops were on parade and as the various battalions, dressed in review order, with their bands, arrived on the scene they took up their allotted positions with bayonets fixed, forming a wide circle round the greensward, in the centre of which stood the memorial, with the beauty of its magnificently formed bronze figures as yet unrevealed.”‘A noble addition’The string would be pulled, the Lord Lieutenant’s speech made and the applause would ring out - as far as the report goes. The  hailed the statue as “a noble addition” to Dublin’s monuments, praising the sculptor John Hughes.As the years wore on, the lauded aesthetics of the piece would be repeatedly called into question. As Randolph Churchill wrote in an article published on the front page in November, 1945: “The largest and ugliest statue in Dublin is outside the Dáil, and is of Queen Victoria - denounced throughout Ireland in the last century as the famine queen.”The statue and the merit of keeping it in situ quickly became a topic of debate. In line with the struggle for Irish independence and rejection of imperialist Britain, the controversy crept into news coverage - particularly following the conclusion of the War of Independence and signing of the Anglo Irish Treaty in 1921. The arguments for and against removing the statue will be familiar.On the latter point, a letter writer in 1933 - when the statue was 25 years old - said: “At one time a new dynasty arose in Egypt, and, defacing all the monuments of an earlier age, earned the universal condemnation of all historians. It is to be hoped that we are more enlightened.” Another - a decade later - pondered whether it would be better to keep it in place, owing to its potential as a tourist attraction.In the latter part of 1943, the issue again hit the pages of The  when the Dublin Corporation passed a resolution requesting the government to remove the statue. The story was carried on the front page the next morning, on September 7th.Proposing the resolution, Councillor Micheál Ó Maoláin said it was odd that “the effigy of a lady whose name stank in the nostrils of past generations of Irishmen” should stand in front of Ireland’s Parliament House, while Lord Edward Fitzgerald had been forgotten. Every generation, he warned, would rise and revolt at the sight of it.On the same day, the leader in The  took a more moderate view compared to “the heat of Mr Ó Maoláin’s feelings”, yet gave the councillor credit on two counts. “Firstly the city would not be any poorer for a monument to Lord Edward, who was a patriot in a sense which is hardly understood nowadays. Secondly, if the Old Queen must be removed, Mr Ó Maoláin will have it done by law and not by dynamite.” The piece mentioned the explosion at Stephen’s Green in 1937 that brought a large statue of George II and his horse to the ground.NeglectThe article also suggested it would be better to remove the statue than allow it to endure further neglect. “If it is true that the statue has never been cleaned since the signing of the Treaty - and certainly its musty green hue gives credit to the story - the joke is rather a poor one and reflects more discredit upon the House of Windsor.”The same “green hue” would catch the eye of Myles na gCopaleen (Brian O’NolanFlann O’Brien) the following month - albeit, he had a much different take. Over all, the writer was not overly bothered with its removal - her statutes were more harmful than her statues, as he put it. “Besides, look at it this way,” he wrote on October 2nd. “Time has given the mere Irish their revenge. The fact is that Victoria has turned green. Of hue she approaches our decent Irish letterbox. And it is the price of her.”In the days after the resolution was passed, cold water was thrown over the project. A story on the front page on September 8th reported that Victoria would be removed, just not yet. Costs were blamed.On November 1st, members of Ailtirí na hAiséirghe - a minor fascist party described then as a Gaelic revival organisation - crashed a Dublin Corporation meeting and shouted from the public galleries: “Get rid of all the symbols of slavery in the streets.” The episode made the front page of the paper and was reported in the British press.It would take until July 22nd, 1948, before the statue came down. Reports about the monument soon died off, bar one or two concerning potential Canadian buyers - the cities of London and Peterborough sought to purchase the statue in 1949, by which point it had “lain on its back in a field in Kilmainham”. But that fell through.In the end, it would be sent to Australia. The  reported the move ahead of time in a report on October 2nd, 1986, headlined: “Statue of Victoria given to Sydney.” Not quite the ending predicted by The  in 1943, when it said the structure would be removed “possibly to some new and friendly site, more probably to the scrapheap”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4279306.1592214742!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"two thirds of men drinking to cope with the lockdown national survey reveals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTwo-thirds of men have been drinking to cope with the lockdown, new research reveals.

The survey was commissioned by Drinkaware and conducted online in April 2020 by Behaviour \u0026amp Attitudes with 1,015 adults (18+) in Ireland.The aim was to assess national attitudes, behaviours and motivational drivers regarding alcohol consumption during Covid-19 restrictions when the majority of people were confined to within just two kilometres of their home.The findings, released at the start of Men’s Health Week, show a disproportionate increase in frequency and volume consumed among men in Ireland when compared with women and the overall population.Men are more likely to report drinking to cope (66 per cent) than women (55 per cent).Men are also more than twice as likely to report binge drinking four or more times in those 30 days (21 per cent), compared to 10 per cent of women and 15 percent national average.However, men are significantly more likely to try and change their drinking habits as a result of the lockdown. Some 35 per cent made small positive changes to their drinking habits during lockdown, compared to 27 per cent of female drinkers and 31 per cent .Commenting on the research, Drinkaware chief executive Sheena Horgan said: “The data tells the story of stark gender ide regarding alcohol consumption in Ireland.“Irish men are clearly using alcohol as a way to cope with the anxiety, loneliness and boredom of Covid-19. Men already fared worse in terms of frequency and volume of drinking. Now they are exhibiting consistently hazardous and potentially harmful drinking habits.“Men’s Health Week gives us the chance to put the focus on men’s wellbeing, and to support each other and renew our collective efforts to spark an open dialogue about men’s physical and mental wellbeing.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4278975.1592160487!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"after the programme for government is agreed what s next","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin and his team arrive at Government Buildings.Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsThey will vote on sending the deal to the party memberships, though it would be a major shock if any of the parties were to refuse to take that step. However, the stance taken by Catherine Martin, the Green Party deputy leader, will be closely watched. Her support could be crucial to the chances of the deal passing with the Greens.How do the party memberships vote?Each party has its own system to decide on the deal. Fianna Fáil has a one-member, one-vote straight ballot among party members, with postal ballots likely to be sent out on Monday.Fine Gael has a more complicated electoral system, involving delegates from each constituency, the executive council and the party’s elected representatives. However, the parliamentary party makes up 50 per cent of the electoral college, so this is by far the most important forum.But it is the Green Party which is likely to face the toughest struggle to ratify the deal. The party constitution requires a two-thirds majority among members to approve any coalition agreement, so it is entirely possible that a majority could support the deal – just not a big enough majority. If that happens, the deal is dead in the water.When will the voting take place?Ballots will be issued to those entitled to vote in the coming days, and once returned, will be counted next week by party headquarters. But the timelines are tight, and there are concerns among some party officials that longer postal delivery times because of the Covid-19 pandemic may result in ballots arriving after a deadline. Anyway, a deadline can’t be extended beyond the end of next week. There was a suggestion that all three parties would announce the results simultaneously, but nothing has been agreed at this point.So what are the deadlines?Votes in both Houses of the Oireachtas on renewing the Offences Against the State Act must be taken before June 30th, or key sections, including those underpinning the Special Criminal Court, will lapse. This vote is held every year and is normally a formality. But unless a new taoiseach is in place to make his 11 nominations to the Seanad, the vote can’t be held in the upper house as it will be legally incomplete, the Government has been advised.So the Dáil needs to elect a new taoiseach, he needs to form a new government and make his nominations to the Seanad before June 30th to allow a vote to take place in that house on that day, a fortnight from next Tuesday.A group of Senators says it will seek a declaration from the High Court this week that the Seanad can legislate without the taoiseach’s 11. If that is successful, it would take the concern about the Offences Against the State Act out of the picture and relax the deadlines, though it would also mean that the Government’s legal advice on the issue was wrong.Assuming the Attorney General’s advice is correct and the end of June deadline holds, the new taoiseach will have to be elected, at the latest on Monday, June 29th, though there are suggestions that it should take place on Friday 26th. There has been no agreement yet among the parties on the precise choreography.Who will be taoiseach?Micheál Martin will be the agreed nominee of the new coalition for the role of taoiseach, with Leo Varadkar taking a Cabinet job – a new Department of the Economy has been mooted for him – and the role of tánaiste. Varadkar – or rather, whoever is the leader of Fine Gael – will become taoiseach halfway through the new government’s five-year term.If Martin is elected by the Dáil, he will then nominate his Cabinet later that day, which would require another Dáil vote. He would also nominate his 11 senators, as previously agreed with the other two party leaders.How are the Cabinet jobs going to be shared out?It is expected that the 15 Cabinet jobs will be allocated on a 6:6:3 ratio, with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil having six members each, and the Greens three. A small number of super junior ministers – probably two, one each for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael – may also be permitted to attend Cabinet, as they do at present. The chief whip also attends.There will be intense speculation over the coming weeks about who gets the jobs. It is a particularly tricky situation for Varadkar, who will have to demote several Fine Gael Ministers and junior Ministers, but Varadkar himself, Paschal Donohoe, Simon Coveney, Simon Harris and Heather Humphries are likely to return.And what happens if one of the parties reject the deal?Sources in all parties agree that while Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are odds-on to accept the deal, it’s impossible to predict the outcome among the Green Party at this stage.If that party rejects the agreement, sources say Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil will seek to go ahead and form a government with the support of a number of independent TDs, though the climate action aspects of the programme for government are likely to be watered down.But there is no certainty that such an agreement could be put together quickly, or at all. The country would be plunged into a political crisis, and there would be a fierce clamour for a general election.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4279295.1592203557!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"strongly green influenced programme for government drawn up","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan meet for talks on Government formation at Government Buildings. Photograph: Alan Betson  The .But the three party leaders remained locked in tense negotiations on Sunday night on the final details of the coalition deal, with differences remaining on tax cuts, the pension age and legislation banning the import of Israeli goods produced in the occupied Palestinian Territories.A potential solution to the pensions issue mentioned by sources would be a deferral in the increase in eligibility age to 67 pending a report from a special commission. Leaving Government Buildings late on Sunday night, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said talks would continue on Monday. It is believed Fine Gael was holding out for a commitment in the document to tax cuts in the future if resources allow. Earlier, the negotiating teams signed off on a draft programme for government after almost six weeks of protracted and often difficult negotiations, leaving the final issues for the party leaders to resolve. The document, which was widely leaked on Sunday night, is expected to be approved by the three parliamentary parties on Monday if the leaders can reach agreement, and will then be put to the members of the three parties for ratification.Internal debatesThere will be particular focus on the Green Party, in which there is expected to be significant opposition to the deal, and where a two-thirds majority is required if the party is to join the coalition. The position of deputy leader Catherine Martin, who was previously opposed to negotiations but led the Green Party team in the talks process, is expected to be pivotal in the party’s internal debates. But several Green TDs were enthusiastic about the deal, pointing to a range of policy wins for the party in the document.Crucially, the programme for government commits the next government to reducing Ireland’s emissions of greenhouse gases by an average of 7 per cent annually.The Greens’ priorities are also reflected in the increase in spending on transport infrastructure. All future capital spending on transport infrastructure will be split 2:1, favouring public transport over roads, and €360 million will be spent every year on cycling and walking infrastructure.There will be a ban on the further exploration for gas in the waters off Ireland and a ban on the importation of fracked gas, which will halt the construction of the Shannon LNG project and other facilities.The Direct Provision system will be abolished within the government’s term and replaced “with a new international protection accommodation policy centred on a not-for-profit approach”.A number of referendums are also promised within the lifetime of the next government, including one on the right to housing.There will be commissions on housing, tax and social welfare and on the future of the Defence Forces, and a permanent pay review body for the Defence Forces will also be established. Carbon tax will rise to €100 per tonne by 2030 rather than €80 per tonne as is planned now, with the resources being re-invested in increased social welfare payments and investment in climate change policies.A new economic stimulus plan for the retail and tourism sectors is expected in July, with a wider national recovery plan following in October.The Land Development Agency will develop cost rental housing, as well as affordable purchase homes, affordable rental homes and social housing on State-owned land.The document also commits that 50,000 social homes will be provided over the next five years, with an emphasis on new builds.If agreed by the leaders and approved by the respective parliamentary parties on Monday, the coalition deal will then be put to the memberships of the three parties for ratification, with postal ballots due to conclude by the end of next week. If the deal is approved by the three parties, a new government will be in place by the end of this month.

Photograph: Noel CelisAFP via Getty Images Beijing reported its second consecutive day of record new numbers of Covid-19 cases on Monday, adding urgency to efforts to rein in a sudden resurgence of the coronavirus in the Chinese capital.The recent outbreak has been traced to Xinfadi, a sprawling wholesale food market that is the biggest in Asia and accounts for 80 per cent of Beijing’s farm produce supply sourced both domestically and from overseas.The market has been shut, tens of thousands of nearby residents are being tested for the virus, and a city-wide campaign launched to identify people who have recently visited the market or been in contact with people who have. Some schools have started to suspend classes.“The risk of the epidemic spreading is very high, so we should take resolute and decisive measures,” Xu Hejiang, spokesman at the Beijing city government, said at a press conference on Monday.Xinfadi, a complex of warehouses and trading halls ning an area the size of nearly 160 soccer pitches, is more than 20 times larger than the seafood market in Wuhan where the coronavirus originated. Thousands of tonnes of vegetables, fruits and meats are traded at Xinfadi each day.Beijing officials on Monday confirmed 36 new Covid-19 cases for June 14th, the same as a day earlier, which was the city’s highest daily infection count since late March. Officials have now reported 79 cases over just four days, the biggest concentration of infections since February.A number of neighbourhoods in the west and southwest of Beijing have been upgraded to medium-risk, including Financial Street where banks and financial firms converge, which calls for measures such as strict control of people and vehicle movements, disinfections and temperature checks. One neighbourhood in the same district as the food market was raised to high-risk, denoting the most severe level of infection and warning people not to go there.Beijing started testing en masse on Sunday, conducting 76,499 tests. Fifty-nine iniduals tested positive, Gao Xiaojun, a spokesperson for the Beijing public health commission, said at Monday’s briefing.Samples of 8,950 people who were recently at Xinfadi had been collected as of early Monday, said Mr Gao, adding that results from the 6,075 tested so far were negative.InvestigationThe new Beijing cluster prompted governments in some cities and provinces to warn their residents against non-essential travel to the capital, and to implement isolation protocols and testing for some incoming visitors from the capital.The northeastern province of Liaoning and northern Hebei province have reported a combined handful of cases connected to the Beijing infections. Sichuan in the southwest reported one suspected case on Monday.The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Sunday it was informed of the outbreak by Chinese officials who were investigating its source and extent. WHO reinforced the need for thorough investigations.“Genetic sequencing from humans and environmental samples is ongoing, and WHO encourages the release of these sequences as soon as possible,” WHO said in its statement. “WHO understands that genetic sequences will be released as soon as possible once further laboratory analyses are completed.”An epidemiologist with the Beijing government said on Sunday that a DNA sequencing of the virus showed the Xinfadi outbreak could have come from Europe.“Our preliminary assessment is the virus came from overseas. We still can’t determine how it got here. It might’ve been on contaminated seafood or meat, or spread from the faeces of people inside the market,” state media quoted Yang Peng as saying.SurveyChina has beaten the US in the battle for world opinion over the handling of coronavirus, according to new polling, with only three countries out of 53 believing the US has dealt with the pandemic better than its superpower rival.The survey comes ahead of a major conference on the future of democracy this week, due to be addressed by the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, the former secretary of state John Kerry and the Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong. The conference is likely to be a rallying point for pro-democracy activists as China and the US enter an ever more explicit ideological contest.The 53-country survey of 120,000 people by the German polling firm Dalia Research and the Alliance of Democracies Foundation, an organisation headed by the former Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen, reveals deep dissatisfaction with US leadership.The survey found electorates in Greece (89 per cent), Taiwan (87 per cent), Ireland (87 per cent), South Korea, Australia and Denmark (all 86 per cent) are happiest worldwide with the performance of their government in controlling the coronavirus. At the bottom end of the scale are Brazil, France, Italy, the US and the UK.Only a third of people around the world said the US responded well to Covid-19, compared with more than 60 per cent who said China’s response was good. In only three countries – Taiwan, the US and South Korea – do more people think the US has responded well to the pandemic than think China has responded well.Reflecting Donald Trump’s unpopularity globally, only a third of Europeans believe the US is a positive force for global democracy, compared with half who say it has had a negative impact. The positive figure has fallen 4 per cent since the same survey last year. Majorities in all 15 of the European countries surveyed say the US has a negative impact on global democracy, with the net negative score at -40 per cent in Germany.EU foreign ministers will meet on Monday to discuss how far to take a more sceptical approach to China. There is a reluctance to enlist in an all-out trade war, and concern that the US is due to implement a law that will require companies to certify that their entire global supply chain – not just the part of the business that sells to the US government – is devoid of equipment from Huawei, the telecoms company ZTE corps, and other Chinese companies.This kind of measure has led to to a striking rise of anti-American feeling within China, the survey shows. The share of Chinese people who think the US has a negative influence on democracy around the world almost doubled since 2019 from 38 per cent to 64 per cent in 2020, moving China up to the top rank as the country most critical of the US.The Alliance of Democracies Foundation has previously conducted research on the extent of election meddling by authoritarian countries making recommendations on how social media companies could do more to shut down bots run by foreign governments.The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, on Sunday ruled out a transatlantic alliance against China a day before talks with Pompeo, and called for a “big, positive agenda for EU-China cooperation”.The meeting between Mr Pompeo and EU foreign ministers is expected to focus on China and “disinformation”, and will be followed in a week’s time by the first EU-China summit under the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and European council president, Charles Michel. The two EU chiefs will meet the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, with the discussions expected to focus on market access.Mr Borrell said the EU would not pick a side in the US-China conflict. “Amid US-China tensions as the main axis of global politics, the pressure to ‘choose sides’ is increasing,” he said. “We as Europeans have to do it ‘my way’, with all the challenges this brings.”He also admitted there were internal isions within the EU with some wishing to follow a policy of equidistance between China and Europe, and others urging Europe to align with the US.He said the transatlantic relationship remained vital for Europe – “the values we share form its bedrock” – but that it was strained by the Trump administration taking “unilateral decisions with which we do not always agree”. –Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4279397.1592217306!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus european leaders urge caution as borders open for travel","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tItalian police officers control vehicles in Nova Gorica, Slovenia, as the border between Slovenia and Italy reopens. Photograph: Jure MakovecAFP via GettyBorders have opened up across Europe after three months of coronavirus closures that began so chaotically in March.But many restrictions persist, it is unclear how keen Europeans will be to travel this summer and the continent is still closed to Americans, Asians and other international tourists.Border checks for most Europeans were dropped overnight in Germany, France and elsewhere, nearly two weeks after Italy opened its frontiers.The European Union’s 27 nations, as well as those in the Schengen passport-free travel area, which also includes a few non-EU nations such as Switzerland, are not expected to start opening to visitors from outside the continent until at least the beginning of next month, and possibly much later.Announcing Monday’s reopening of borders and Paris restaurants, French President Emmanuel Macron said it is time “to turn the page of the first act of the crisis” and “rediscover our taste for freedom”.But he warned: “This doesn’t mean the virus has disappeared and we can totally let down our guard. The summer of 2020 will be a summer unlike any other.”Even inside Europe, there is caution after more than 182,000 virus-linked deaths.Europe has had more than two million of the world’s 7.9 million confirmed infections, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.“We have got the pandemic under control, (but) the reopening of our frontiers is a critical moment,” Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez said on Sunday as he announced that his hard-hit country is moving forward its opening to European travellers by 10 days to June 21th.“The threat is still real. The virus is still out there,” he said.TourismStill, the need to get Europe’s tourism industry up and running again is also urgent for countries such as Spain and Greece as the economic fallout of the crisis multiplies.Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis acknowledged that “a lot will depend on whether people feel comfortable to travel and whether we can project Greece as a safe destination”.In a trial run, Spain is allowing thousands of Germans to fly to its Balearic Islands starting on Monday — waiving its 14-day quarantine for the group.The idea is to test out best practices in the coronavirus era.“This pilot programme will help us learn a lot for what lies ahead in the coming months,” Mr Sanchez said.“We want our country, which is already known as a world-class tourist destination, to be recognised as also a secure destination.”Europe’s reopening is not a repeat of the chaotic free-for-all in March, when panicked, unco-ordinated border closures caused traffic jams that stretched for miles.Still, it is a complicated, shifting patchwork of different rules, and not everyone is equally free to travel everywhere.Several countries are not opening up yet to everyone.Norway and Denmark, for example, are keeping their borders closed with Sweden, whose virus strategy avoided a lockdown but produced a relatively high per capita death rate.Cars queued up on Monday morning at some crossings on the German border with Denmark, which is now letting in visitors from Germany but only if they have booked accommodation for at least six nights.Self-quarantineBritain, which left the EU in January but remains closely aligned with the bloc until the end of this year, only last week imposed a 14-day quarantine requirement for most arrivals, horrifying its tourism and aviation industries.As a result, France is asking people coming from Britain to self-quarantine for two weeks and several other nations are not even letting British tourists come in during the first wave of reopenings.With flights only gradually picking up, nervousness about new outbreaks abroad, uncertainty about social distancing at tourist venues and many people facing record unemployment or pay cuts, many Europeans may choose simply to stay home or explore their own countries.German chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz are both planning to holiday in their homelands this year.“The recommendation is still, if you want to be really safe, a holiday in Austria, ” Austrian foreign minister Alexander Schallenberg told ORF television, recalling the scramble in March to bring home thousands of tourists as borders slammed shut.“In Austria, you know that you don’t have to cross a border if you want to get home, and you know the infrastructure and the health system well,” he said.The German government, which helped fly 240,000 people home as the pandemic grew exponentially, also has no desire to repeat that experience.“My appeal to all those who travel: enjoy your summer holiday — but enjoy it with caution and responsibility,” German foreign minister Heiko Maas said.“In the summer holidays, we want to make it as difficult as possible for the virus to spread again in Europe.”The Dutch government said its citizens can now visit 16 European nations, but urged caution.“You can go abroad for your holiday again,” foreign minister Stef Blok said.“But it won’t be as carefree as before the corona crisis. The virus is still among us and the situation remains uncertain.”\u0026nbsp– APEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4278912.1592148617!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nil all at half time in tortuous brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA timetable for the second half of Brexit talks has been set out with six rounds of negotiations to take place between June 29th and August 21st. Photograph: EPAOlivier HosletLife seemed to pause in February, and this seems to have affected the perception of time. Incredibly, half of 2020 is gone: and that means just six months remain before goods sold into Britain will be subject to border checks, customs declarations, and possibly tariffs.These onerous changes will come into force no matter what deal is agreed between London and Brussels, and indeed if no deal is agreed at all. They are expected to have a heavy impact on companies in the Republic, and any businesses across the EU dependent on exports to Britain. Firms have been asked to prepare as a matter of urgency.The British government has said, definitively, that it will not extend the transition period. Instead, it proposes to introduce the border requirements in stages. Checks on live animals will come into force right away in January. Pre-notification and health certification for meat, dairy, and other animal products will come into force from April. Full checks and declarations will be in place from July. For the first half of the year, companies will have a grace period to make customs declarations for their goods and pay whatever tariffs are required.Since February, talks between Britain and the European Union have continued over video calls to try to hash out a deal that avoids the harshest outcome of an automatic shift to World Trade Organisation trade terms on January 1st. The state of the talks now could be described as nil-all at half time. Both teams have played defensively and sat deep on the pitch neither has conceded, no one has scored.The second half British prime minister Boris Johnson will join a video conference on Monday with the presidents of the three European institutions of the commission, council, and parliament: Ursula von der Leyen, Charles Michel, and David Sassoli. Earlier this year, Britain was warning that it could use this moment to dramatically walk away from talks and declare it would spend all its energy on preparing for World Trade Organisation terms. It has shifted away from this approach, instead pushing the EU to enter intensive talks next month.A timetable for the second half has been set out: six rounds of negotiations are to take place between June 29th and August 21st. Negotiators will alternate between physical meetings in Brussels and London as long as national health guidance allows it, but talks could shift online again.What the EU is seeking in the talks was decided by the 27 remaining members of the EU and given to chief negotiator Michel Barnier in a 46-page mandate in February.He has updated the member states and the European institutions throughout the talks, as any shift or concession by the EU side can only be given with consensus agreement.No change to the mandate is needed to get an agreement, he told the European Parliament last week. “We can find the necessary compromises, on the condition that the UK changes its approach,” the Frenchman said.Areas of disagreementThere are four stubborn areas of disagreement. One is the so-called level playing field: the EU’s ambition to ensure fair competition between British and EU countries. Brussels will not grant British companies free access to EU markets if they can undercut local businesses it will only do so if they are required to follow equivalent standards on, for example, labour and the environment. This is anathema to Britain, as it sounds like signing back up to the kind of regulatory restrictions it left the EU to escape.Too bad, Brussels responds: no free access for your businesses to the single market then.Another issue is fisheries. In a nutshell: Britain wants to take back exclusive rights over its territorial waters. These would give it far more fish than the British could eat. Want to sell fish to the EU? Fine, says Brussels, but only if EU fishing boats can have access to British waters. The EU side wants to stick to the existing quota system for this Britain wants to introduce yearly access talks.On policing and judicial cooperation, Britain does not want to continue to follow EU data protection standards, and shies away from an agreement with the EU on human rights, which it says has no place in a trade deal. The final issue is governance: ie, how disputes could be mediated. Britain does not want the ultimate authority to be the European Court of Justice the EU insists this is the only body that can rule on matters of EU law.British negotiators can sound somewhat indignant at the EU’s insistence on written and legal guarantees on matters such as standards and human rights, insisting that Britain has high standards, and should be trusted, rather than treated as a potential violator.No compromiseThe EU accuses Britain of continuing to not accept that negative consequences are inevitable from Brexit, and of demanding privileges that are only available to member states. The British negotiators accuse the EU of failing to accept its sovereignty, and of asking for things that go far beyond previous trade deals with countries like Japan or Canada. Brussels rejects this comparison,\u0026nbsp explaining that Japan and Canada are far away, so don’t have the ability to undercut the EU that Britain could have.Brussels believes it has the upper hand, because if Britain chooses not to compromise and to go for World Trade Organization terms, the same EU negotiating mandate will await them if they return for talks to ease the tariffs. There is some flexibility on details, but the principles will not shift. “The United Kingdom chose to become a third country. It cannot have the best of both worlds!” Barnier put it to parliament. “We want a very ambitious economic partnership, but it must reflect the long-term economic and political interests of the EU. This is not a dogmatic or technocratic position,” he added. “Simply: we will never compromise on our European values or on our economic and trade interests, to the benefit of the British economy.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

In November 1871 he found the sick explorer and greeted him with the words : Dr Livingstone, I presume?But Bishop Gregory Cameron, bishop of St Asaph, has written to the city council asking for the removal of the monument to Stanley from its place near the River Elwy and signed a petition calling for the removal of a statue from nearby Denbigh town centre.He said: Exactly what do we commemorate in the life of Henry Morton Stanley, born John Rowlands? He was an adventurer, who had little respect for the natives of Africa, and who shared in management of one of the most atrocious and exploitative colonial endeavours ever in that vast continent, the enslaving of an entire population to service the wealth creation of King Leopold II of the Belgians through the production of rubber.He repudiated his Welsh upbringing and paid scant regard to the communities of St Asaph and Denbigh which had nurtured him. So why exactly is there a statue of him in Denbigh\u0027s main square, and another monument at the bottom of St Asaph\u0027s High Street?Henry Morton Stanley was born in 1841 as John Rowlands in Denbigh. He was abandoned by his mother as a young baby and his father died a few weeks after his birth. He spent some time in the St Asaph Workhouse before emigrating to America and subsequently travelling to Africa.Dispatched by the New York Herald to find David Livingstone, a Scottish missionary who had gone missing in Africa, Stanley set off in 1871 on an eight-month, 7,000-mile trip accompanied by 200 porters. The goal was accomplished, but not without cost – deserters were flogged and a contemporary, Sir Richard Francis Burton, claimed: “Stanley shoots Africans as if they were monkeys.”On a second trip in 1874, Stanley, in partnership with The Daily , traced the course of the River Congo to the sea. In 1876 he made a deal with King Leopold II to travel back to the Congo, and as a result became associated with the Belgium king’s brutal regime, a link he spent years defending.In 2011, Bishop Gregory expressed dismay that St Asaph city council had elected to commemorate a man well known for his imperialist career, his brutality towards the indigenous African population, and for his collaboration with King Leopold in the subjugation, exploitation and maltreatment of the Congolese people.In a new letter to the city council, the bishop said : Current affairs amply demonstrate the anger and distress caused by the celebration of racist and colonialist pioneers, I would like to suggest to you that the time has come to remove the offence of this monument.I would like to feel that St Asaph city council would be willing to identify with the Black Lives Matter campaign by making the highly symbolic gesture of putting this monument out of sight, and taking a stand for equality and ersity.St Asaph Cathedral contains a small plaque to Stanley and discussions are taking place as to whether it should be removed or a further panel added to provide interpretation. The Dean of St Asaph Cathedral, the Very Revd Nigel Williams said: The plaque is not prominent and does not draw attention to itself. It does not honour Stanley as a statue. Additional information alongside could provide the opportunity for visitors to properly consider the issues but it\u0027s right that we think carefully about its place here in the cathedral.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"keep quiet two metre rule sage experts told","story":"Scientists advising the Government about the coronavirus crisis have been warned not to give their personal opinion about the two-metre rule, amid growing controversy over whether it should be enforced in pubs, restaurants and schools.Experts on the sub-committees that feed into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies had publicly questioned the validity of the research which led to the social-distancing diktat, with some suggesting that remaining one metre apart would be sufficient to reduce the spread of infection.In papers released by Sage’s environmental and modelling group last Friday, advisers also told ministers that the two-metre rule could be abandoned by businesses if they introduce other measures to stop the spread of Covid-19, such as getting workers to take regular breaks and sit next to each other.However, the  has learned that a message from a Government figure was passed down through SAGE last week that other than publishing papers, advisers should keep their thoughts on the matter private, as it grapples with whether or not to alter its official guidance to the public.A source said: “It has come through SAGE channels as an official request from elsewhere in Government. There is concern that there should only be one public message about the science. But there isn’t such a thing as ‘the science’. There are lots of different sciences.”The Government has denied it was an official edict. A spokesperson said: “There is no ban on scientists who provide advice to the government speaking to anyone about their own areas of expertise and academic work.“We are committed to thorough and transparent debate of all the evidence presented to SAGE and its sub-committees.”The Official’s apparent attempt to curb what scientists say in public comes as the Government faces mounting pressure to revise the two metre rule, amid concerns that businesses and schools will not be able to fully reopen whilst it is in place.The Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on May 27th that he had asked SAGE to look again at the guidance, but Downing Street said later that it believed the rule should stay in place and that it would remain under review. It is expected to be scrapped in time for the new school year to start in September.However, there is growing dissent amongst experts on SAGE sub-committees over whether the research which led to the guidance in the first place is good enough.A mathematical modelling paper produced by Sage in April, and based on past experiments carried out in other countries, concluded that the risk of exposure to the coronavirus “could be 10-30 times higher at one metre compared to two metres.Several members have raised objections to the two-metre rule, amid concerns that modelling done by SAGE was based on inadequate data.Last week, an analysis published in the Lancet found the risk of catching the coronavirus whilst standing one metre apart was only around twice that of standing two metres apart - a 2.6 per cent chance compared to 1.3 per cent.But the new SAGE research, prepared by its environmental and modelling group and published last week, says that this does not consider the positioning of the person – meaning the way they are facing – or how the virus is likely to be transmitted. The group said that sitting within one metre of a person side by side or back to back is as safe as facing a person at two metres when indoors. Sir Patrick Vallance, the Government’s chief scientific adviser, has previously made it clear that it was up to politicians, not scientists, to make a decision on relaxing the 2 metre rule.“It’s not a scientific rule, it is a risk-based assessment.”The apparent move to muzzle advisers is likely to reignite anger over the Government’s lack of transparency around SAGE at the start of the coronavirus crisis, including its initial refusal to say who sits on the committee.It also follows claims that England’s chief nurse, Ruth May, was dropped from one of Downing Street’s daily briefings after she refused to publicly back the Prime Minister’s most senior aide, Dominic Cummings, in the row over his trip to Durham during lockdown.

Thirty-six infections were confirmed on both Saturday and Sunday, bringing the total to 79 cases over the last four days in the city of more than 20 million. Cases erupting in Beijing are the latest reminder that authorities in China continue to struggle with subsequent waves of the coronavirus, even after instituting draconian lockdowns and quarantine measures. It remains unclear how people fell ill in Beijing, as China has reported nearly no local transmissions in recent weeks, finding cases primarily via infections brought in by travellers arriving from abroad. “Our preliminary assessment is that the virus came from overseas. We still can’t determine how it got here. It might have been on contaminated seafood or meat, or spread from the feces of people inside the market,” Yang Peng, an epidemiologist with Beijing’s center for disease control and prevention, told state media. Mr Yang also said that genetic sequencing of the virus indicated it could be linked to a strain from Europe.Aggressive contact tracing has found infected people either shopped or worked in Beijing’s Xinfadi market, the largest wholesale food market in Asia, or came in contact with someone who had been there. Officials shut the market before dawn on Saturday after the novel coronavirus was reportedly detected on a chopping board used by a vendor who sold imported salmon, according to Chinese state media. Local authorities have canvassed neighbourhoods in efforts to identify those who had visited Xinfadi market, or came in contact with people who had visited recently. Anyone identified with a link to the market is being tested, and some travellers arriving in other parts of China from Beijing are being told to quarantine.Samples from nearly 9,000 people have been collected as of early Monday. Results from the first two-thirds have come back negative, said Beijing health officials. The neighbourhood in southern Beijing where the market is located has been deemed high risk. Ten nearby areas have been raised to medium risk, including the city’s financial district.Some restaurants have begun pulling salmon from their menus, and the fish has been removed from supermarket shelves. Local authorities in other parts of China are also warning against non-essential travel to Beijing. Screening measures that had been relaxed in recent weeks have been stepped up, while schools and sports venues have been ordered to close again. A plan to allow grades one to three return to school this week has been scrapped.To enter public places, such as shops, banks and parks, people must show a “green” health code – a clear contagion risk profile – submit to temperature checks and register personal details, such as ID and mobile numbers, to aid contact tracing. Entering residential and office compounds means flashing compound passes.  Thousands of tons of meat and produce are sold daily at the sprawling Xinfadi market, which is about 20 times the size of the Wuhan seafood market where the coronavirus was initially detected last December. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"shops open not shopper used","story":"Back to normal shopping tomorrow!” remarked my socially distanced neighbour in the supermarket queue yesterday. “See you tomorrow!” called the manager of my local charity shop as I walked home, arranging her window display for the first time in 12 weeks. “Absolutely!” I replied, not wanting to spoil their newfound retail enthusiasm on a sunny Sunday morning, brilliant with the hope of renewed normality. But in my mind there echoed the equivocal response of the browbeaten editor of Evelyn Waugh’s Scoop: “Up to a point.”All my life, I have been a keen and accomplished shopper, following the formidable example of my mother. As a child I used to accompany her stately progress along our local high street, from fishmonger to butcher to grocer, learning important life lessons about good food and good shopkeepers. Later there came an education in retail therapy: at Madame Stuart of Canterbury I admired bolts of brocade and chiffon while my mother discussed evening dresses with Madame (implacably chic black dress, pincushion on an elastic band around her wrist).There followed exotic trips to Way In, Harrods’s teen boutique, with lunch afterwards in the dim, rose-plush surroundings of the Dress Circle restaurant. Since then I have regarded shopping as a kind of discipline and, occasionally, a defiant gesture of hope.Hours before my son was born, I bought a preposterous couture version of a leather biker jacket. “It will remind you,” said the shop assistant, understanding my need to remember the person I was before I became a mother. Almost 30 years later, moments before lockdown, I impulse-bought an absurd pair of cream leather lace-up boots from M\u0026ampS, sensing that I might never again shop in the same way.The life of a freelance writer is both fortunate (no commuting a welcome absence of chivvying memos) and lonely. It is a kind of self-imposed lockdown, to which shopping – IRL, rather than online – provides a welcome punctuation: the solid reality of ordinary things – potatoes, coffee, mustard – alongside the drama of everyday life. The Covid-driven revelation that shop staff are key workers, together with doctors and nurses, cleaners and carers, was not news to me. Before lockdown, there were days on which the only people I spoke to were my kind, knowledgeable and entertaining local shopkeepers.Now shops are reopening and the Prime Minister has urged us to go out and spend. I long for nothing more than the old normal: my online experience has been miserable – fraught with the sedentary expectation and disappointment to which shopping used to be such a erting and effective antidote. The easing points us in the direction of the old model, from the “revenge shopping” for expensive couture fripperies that followed China’s emergence from lockdown, to the hours-long queues at Ikea and B\u0026ampQ. The human impulse to get new stuff, we may conclude, is indefatigable.As for me, since high street shopping cautiously opened I have queued, briefly, at a garden centre for compost and herbs. I am accustomed to queuing at food shops (I take a book to read while I wait). As for “normal” shopping – I feel no impulse to go there: for now it feels too soon too strange. But the habit is ingrained, so who knows what tomorrow may bring?More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/03/13/stars.jpg","title":"alien civilisation home galaxy intelligent life form planets","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.New calculations could shed light on the fate of our own species and planetThere could be more than 30 alien civilisations in our galaxy, researchers have found in a major study.A new paper looked to understand how many planets in our neighbourhood could be home to alien life, by assuming that life develops on other planets in a similar way to how it develops on Earth, and matching that to planets that could be home to similar evolution.It found that there could be dozens of active civilisations waiting to be found in our Milky Way. But it could also shed light on our own fate, and suggest our prospects for long-term survival are lower than we may have thought.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines “There should be at least a few dozen active civilizations in our Galaxy under the assumption that it takes 5 billion years for intelligent life to form on other planets, as on Earth,” Christopher Conselice of the University of Nottingham said in a statement.“The idea is looking at evolution, but on a cosmic scale. We call this calculation the Astrobiological Copernican Limit.”Dust could hold major clue to alien life, scientists sayThe Astrobiological Copernican limits come in two forms.One is the ‘weak’ limit, which suggests that intelligent life forms on a planet any time after 5 billion years. The other is the ‘Strong’ limit where life formed between 4.5 billion and 5 billion years years ago.The new research used the latter, and also assumed that these new species would need to develop in metal-rich environments.This is because human beings developed near a metal-rich environment, due to the metal present in the Sun.Previous research from 2012 suggests a suitable “minimum stellar metallicity” required for the formation of planets that would be similar to Earth.Researchers were then able to use those assumptions about where life may form to understand how many planets in our Milky Way would be able to satisfy those conditions.Detecting any civilisations in our galaxy is strongly dependent on how well we can pick up signals being sent into space.These include radio transmissions from satellites and television. If these technological civilisations last as long as ours, which has been sending out signals for the last century or so, then it is estimated there could be 36 ongoing intelligent civilisations.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The average distance to any possible civilisation would be 17,000 light years, which makes communication very challenging.The other scenario is that we are the only intelligent life in the galaxy, and that civilisations die out before we can detect them.“Our new research suggests that searches for extraterrestrial intelligent civilizations not only reveals the existence of how life forms, but also gives us clues for how long our own civilization will last,” Professor Conselice said.“If we find that intelligent life is common then this would reveal that our civilization could exist for much longer than a few hundred years, alternatively if we find that there are no active civilizations in our Galaxy it is a bad sign for our own long-term existence. By searching for extraterrestrial intelligent life — even if we find nothing — we are discovering our own future and fate.“The new study was led by the University of Nottingham and published today in The Astrophysical Journal.This is not the only recent news to imply the development of intelligent life in the galaxy.Scientists have found a potential habitable planet called ‘Proxima b’ around the star Proxima Centauri, approximately 4.2 million light years from the Sun.It receives comparable amounts of energy to that the Earth gets from the Sun. If there is liquid form on the planet, it could harbour life, but researchers said there is still much to be done before that can be confirmed, such as checking for the atmosphere and chemicals that could support life.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It therefore cannot be used to identify people from low resolution images captured by security cameras.The PULSE (Photo Upsampling via Latent Space Exploration) system developed by Dr Rudin and her team creates images with 64-times the resolution than the original blurred picture.AI that mimics the brain needs sleep just like humans, study revealsThe PULSE algorithm is able to achieve such high levels of resolution by reverse engineering the image from high resolution images that look similar to the low resolution image when down scaled.Through this process, facial features like eyelashes, teeth and wrinkles that were impossible to see in the low resolution image become recognisable and detailed.Instead of starting with the low resolution image and slowly adding detail, PULSE traverses the high resolution natural image manifold, searching for images that downscale to the original low resolution image, states a paper detailing the research.Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality at higher resolutions and scale factors than previously possible.The system could theoretically be used on low resolution images of almost anything, ranging from medicine and microscopy, to astronomy and satellite imagery.This means noisy, poor-quality images of distant planets and solar systems could be imagined in high resolution.The research will be presented at the 2020 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) this week.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

John Lewis was reopening two branches on Monday, while Argos was due to open just 145 out of more than 800 stores.Primark is taking a different approach, reopening all of its 153 stores. The budget clothing specialist has been hit harder than most by the lockdown as it does not have an online storefront, meaning goods have been left stacked up in warehouses or on shelves. JD Sports is reopening all 309 of its branches on Monday.Certain shops face particular challenges in complying with government guidance, such as shoe retailers which now have to “quarantine” pairs that customers have tried on. Changing rooms at most clothes shops will remain closed while bookshops have said they will take items off shelves after people have touched them. Waterstones will only return items to the shop floor after 72 hours.Shops are required to install screens at checkouts and mark two-metre distance intervals on the floor to help customers stay apart. Retailers including Ikea and John Lewis have introduced social distancing wardens to help with this.As with supermarkets, numbers within non-essential stores will be strictly limited, meaning shoppers will be faced with queues outside.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailRichard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, forecasts that shopping centres will be slower to reopen than high streets because people will prefer to shop in local, familiar, open-air environments, rather than travel to large complexes.He pointed out that shopping centres often attracted consumers looking for a day out by offering an array of food options and other leisure experiences, nearly all of which will remain closed.Councils are urging shoppers to take extra care when visiting high streets and town centres to avoid a second spike in coronavirus infections.The District Councils’ Network, which represents local authorities, said it wanted the public to be reassured that safety measures would be in place for them to follow.To make visits to town centres and high streets safe, councils are carrying out more frequent street cleaning, providing hand-sanitiser posts, adapting public seating and conveniences, creating more pedestrianised spaces and streets and deploying council staff or volunteers to provide help and advice.Government ministers have also tried their best to give people the confidence to return to high streets and shopping centres. Small business minister Paul Scully told BBC Breakfast: The high street is going to be a different place to what it was before, with the one-way systems, with the hand sanitisers, and with people not trying clothes on in the same way. He echoed Boris Johnson who said on Sunday that people should shop and shop with confidence.Shops have been asked to encourage customers to shop alone unless they need extra assistance and to adjust routes around stores to minimise congestion.Given the constraints in place, retailers face a tough challenge encouraging some reluctant consumers back into stores.While there is likely to be some pent-up demand as people have the chance to browse and shop in a way they have not been able to since March, millions of consumers remain wary of public spaces while others are concerned about their finances.What are the lockdown rules now and what can you do from today?Indications from other countries is that footfall on high streets will, unsurprisingly, increase as shops reopen but that this may not translate into sales.That puts Britain’s struggling high streets in an even more perilous position as shops face high costs on rents and wages, for example, but greatly reduced revenues.David Fox, co-head of retail at property advisors Colliers, said: “Due to the social distancing measures and strict government protocols that retailers need to adhere to, there will be a mismatch of customers desire to shop and businesses ability to meet the demand. “The difficulty for retailers will be the logistics of the new health, safety and hygiene policies within the stores, with skeleton staffing to manage queueing and perform their sales duties.”Those shoppers who do venture out may be able to pick up bargains, particularly if they can hold off on purchases for a couple of weeks.Primark revealed recently that it had £1.9bn-worth of items in stock, more than double the amount it would usually hold. By one estimate, fashion retailers have around £15bn of unsold garments. Shoppers may be able to take advantage of heavy discounts as chains try to sell this excess before it falls out of fashion.However, some experts think retailers will hold off before slashing prices. Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at consultancy firm PwC said it was unlikely that consumers would see “wall-to-wall sales” this week.Many retailers have already offered big discounts online, with promotions reaching levels normally only seen on Black Friday.Ms Hooker predicts a bounce in sales this month. “If June trading does not make a big enough dent in stocks, we predict a rush of promotions and sales later in the summer.”Oxfam says charity shops are likely to be packed with “gems” as they reopen this week and fill up with items that people have cleared out during lockdown.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This could be due to the delay between people experiencing symptoms and people being tested for Covid-19.Google has previously attempted to predict such trends through its nowcast function, which launched in 2008. A paper published in the scientific journal Nature at the time explained how people\u0027s search patterns could estimate flu prevalence two weeks before it was registered by official bodies like the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).As the world\u0027s most popular online search engine, the data from people\u0027s digital footprints offered potentially life-saving insights and it was the poster child of so-called \u0027Big Data\u0027. But by 2015 it was shut down after it failed to foresee a massive flu outbreak in 2013.UK now has more daily Covid-19 deaths than the rest of Europe combinedIt was described by some publications as an epic failure and a note on its landing page now states: Google Flu Trends and Google Dengue Trends are no longer publishing current estimates of Flu and Dengue fever based on search patterns...  It is still early days for nowcasting and similar tools for understanding the spread of diseases like flu and dengue – we\u0027re excited to see what comes next.A blog post explaining the decision said that Google would work directly with academic institutions to make sense of the search data. More than 265 peer-reviewed papers have since drawn on aggregated data taken from Google searches, used to track epidemics like Ebola in 2014, Zika in 2016 and West Nile fever over several years in Italy.

So come out, don\u0027t rush out, we\u0027ve got weeks like this.\u0026nbspPakistan coronavirus cases could surge dramaticallyPakistan\u0027s number of infected people neared 145,000 Monday as leaders warned the coronavirus could sweep through the population.They say the number of infected people may double by the end of June and were likely to hit a stunning 1.2 million by the end of July if Pakistan\u0027s 220 million people continue to flout basic precautions like wearing a mask.Planning and Development Minister Asad Umer, who also heads the government\u0027s COVID-19 command center, warned that the virus will rampage through Pakistan unless there is “a change in our attitude toward the virus,” that ends the relentless refusal of most in Pakistan to social distance and wear masks in public.Still he defended Pakistan\u0027s easing on lockdown restrictions saying the country\u0027s economy would collapse under the burden of a total shutdown. Pakistan has stepped back on some easing of restrictions, closing markets on the weekend and extending closures of large wedding halls, restaurants, gymnasiums and large gatherings.Pakistan\u0027s doctors have pleaded for stricter lockdowns saying the struggling health care system is already straining under the escalating numbers of infections. On Monday. Pakistan reached 2,729 deaths since mid March.APGhana health minister being treated for coronavirusGhana\u0027s president says Health Minister Kwaku Agyemang-Manu is being treated for Covid-19 at a hospital.In a state broadcast Sunday night, President Nana Akufo-Addo said the health minister had “contracted the virus in his line of duty” leading the West African nation\u0027s fight against Covid-19.Ghana has one of highest number of confirmed cases in Africa because of its robust testing, with more than 11,400 cases. Health authorities have reported 51 deaths.News of the health minister\u0027s illness further fueled worries as Ghana\u0027s universities prepared to reopen Monday so students in their final year of study can take exams.“If the health minister is contracting the disease, what is the guarantee that my son will be safe?” said Peter Owusu, whose son studies at the University of Cape Coast.APPlease allow the blog a moment to loadNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

All the famous faces, including a picture of Sir Peter, are “fans” of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group.Each fragment will be signed by the artist and auctioned on Bidsquare, with bids starting at £325. The auction will be live until midnight on 26 June.The idea originated when London Advertising approached Sir Peter about the project as it wanted to use the mural to raise money for organisations helping people during the pandemic.Sir Peter, who also designed artwork for Paul Weller, Ian Dury and The Who, said: “I’m very happy that the Mandarin Oriental mural can be used a second time to raise money for such a wonderful purpose. I do all kinds of areas of work but one of them is to make crowds of people.Created with Sketch.

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe latest figures from The Trussell Trust show April was the busiest month ever for the network of food banks, with an 89 per cent increase in emergency parcels compared with the same month in 2019.And the number of parcels provided for children has more than doubled, while almost twice as many families with children are receiving them (a 95 per cent rise).Colman visits The Felix ProjectDr Rachel Loopstra, lecturer in nutrition at King’s College London, said: “It’s clear from the data, as well as from trends in foodbank use, that families with children are really struggling right now. Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Everyone is very grateful,’ says a volunteer who also uses service when his own illness means he is unable to pitch inFormer music manager John McIntyre was unsure how he would cope when lockdown began.“I was very scared,” said the 75-year-old who has a respiratory condition and lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Dalston. “If I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen to the heart. I just had to follow the advice and be safe.” Mr McIntyre, who used to manage the jazz reggae band The Beatroots, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.He has relied for his daily meal from local charity Made In Hackney which is supplied by our Help the Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project. Mr McIntyre is one of more than two million people who are classified as “extremely vulnerable” because they have compromised immune systems. For the last 10 weeks, many of them have struggled to get access to food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince March, volunteers from the River House Trust charity have been dropping off Felix produce to people living with HIV. One such volunteer is former actor Stephen Hart who was diagnosed in 2006. When he is too ill to leave the house, he also uses the food delivery service.Despite being high-risk and a life-long diabetic, Mr Hart has been helping to get food to those more vulnerable than him. He has been unable to work since his health deteriorated two years ago, but Mr Hart, who lives alone in south London, said he wanted to help others.How to support our campaign“When I feel well enough, I pick up boxes from River House and drop them off for people who need them,” he said. “I do it when I can but some days are bad days.”Mr Hart said his condition means sometimes he can’t get out of bed. He occasionally receives a Felix box for himself so he knows he has food when he is too sick to move. “It is reassuring to have food in the house,” he said. “Felix has been a lifeline.”Although the British HIV Association said there “remains no evidence” that people with HIV are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, those with a low CD4 count – the white blood cells affected by HIV – have been advised to shield.Mr Hart said members of the HIV community have been “nervous” since the outbreak. “There isn’t much specific advice so the community has been trying to look after each other.”A 62-year-old living with HIV for 37 years, who asked not to be named, described how his parcels have helped him. He said: “I pick up the boxes as I don’t have energy to go shopping. They’ve been great.”Mr Hart said it was extremely moving to see the response to his deliveries: “It is amazing. Everyone is very grateful.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Wearing face coverings is to be compulsory on public transport in England from 15 June, with fines for those who refuse, transport secretary Grant Shapps has announced.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Mr Shapps said the move was designed to prevent an upsurge in coronavirus infections as the country moves to the next stage of lockdown relaxation, with non-essential shops allowed to reopen.Mr Shapps said wearing a face covering would be made a “condition of travel” on public transport, allowing passengers to be refused carriage if they do not comply, with the British Transport Police called in to deal with those resisting the rule where necessary. Face coverings are not currently included in the Health Protection Regulations which give the police legal power to take action over lockdown breaches. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Shapps said: “As of Monday 15 June face coverings will become mandatory on public transport.“That doesn’t mean surgical masks, which we must keep for clinical settings. It means the kind of face covering you can easily make at home. There will be exemptions to these rules for very young children, for disabled people and those with breathing difficulties.”He added: “We need to ensure every precaution is taken on buses, trains, aircraft, and on ferries.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“With more people using transport, the evidence suggests wearing face coverings offers some – albeit limited – protection against the spread for the virus.”Frontline staff such as bus drivers will also be required to wear face coverings, and Mr Shapps said the government will work with devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to try to make the change nationwide.The announcement was welcomed by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who has long lobbied for mandatory face coverings on the capital’s Underground system.“I’m pleased that our lobbying has paid off and the government has finally seen sense and made it mandatory for people to wear face coverings on public transport,” said Mr Khan.Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union Aslef, agreed: “This is a sensible step. We have been working closely with the government to ensure that agreed increases in services on Britain’s train and Tube network is done in a safe and controlled manner, to help spread the loading, and maintain social distancing for the safety of passengers and staff.“The instruction to wear face coverings to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus will ease the concerns of people travelling, and working, on the transport network.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But one clear, logical, widely accepted side effect is that face coverings may give an excuse to easing other more important measures,” said Dr Lazzarino.“Will more people use the Tube or buses because they will feel more secure given that everybody wears a face covering? This will increase the risk of transmission.“Will people be able not to contaminate their hands and the handrails by not touching their face coverings and not touching the handrails while standing inside buses and trains? This seems to be impossible to me. Face coverings can therefore be a vehicle of infection, rather than a barrier.”But health care professor Prof Trish Greenhalgh of the University of Oxford said: “Face coverings aren’t 100 per cent effective, but they’re not zero per cent effective either.“I’ve seen evidence that a double layer of cloth is between 60 and 90 per cent effective in stopping the spread of viral-laden droplets coming from the wearer, and also that the same mask is also 30-50 per cent effective at stopping virus particles getting to the wearer. You can argue about the exact percentages, but overall, if everyone wears a face covering when they’re at close quarters, transmission is going to go down dramatically.”Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: “This policy will add more burden on the general public to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This is much more complicated than ‘wash your hands for 20 seconds’ or ‘stay at home’. We are asking the whole population of Britain, with no prior experience of mask-wearing, to overnight become competent makers, wearers, and maintainers of PPE.“I have seen no new evidence to suggest why the government is reversing its previous policy, and ignoring its previous scientific guidance and the guidance of the WHO. I’m left wondering if this is a political decision, rather than one based on science.”Labour’s shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: “This is just another example of the government being slow to act. Two months ago, Labour immediately backed the Mayor of London’s call for face coverings on public transport to be compulsory. Yet only now Tory ministers are acting.“Two months after first raising this with government we are still yet to hear whether drivers will be issued with gloves, masks, and other PPE items as standard, what specification this PPE should be and, if there isn’t sufficient PPE, whether buses should still run.“We can’t go on like this. We need a comprehensive transport plan to get our public transport moving, to protect staff and to protect passengers.”Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy said he expected most passengers to comply with the requirement to wear face coverings.“I am not expecting a huge upsurge in railway staff having to police this,” he told the No 10 briefing. “I am expecting sensible passengers to do their duty and look after themselves and others.”Mr Shapps said that if people refused to comply they could be fined under new provisions in the national rail conditions of travel and the public service vehicle regulations for buses.“It is a condition of travel. You cannot travel unless you are wearing a face covering,” he said. “There will also be other powers so it could ultimately lead to fines. I very much hope we won’t be in that situation.”He said he did not expect enforcement action to be required on a regular basis, saying: “I expect the vast majority of people won’t need to be forced into this, because wearing a face covering helps protect others and most people simply want to help defeat this disease.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

John Lewis was reopening two branches on Monday, while Argos was due to open just 145 out of more than 800 stores.Primark is taking a different approach, reopening all of its 153 stores. The budget clothing specialist has been hit harder than most by the lockdown as it does not have an online storefront, meaning goods have been left stacked up in warehouses or on shelves. JD Sports is reopening all 309 of its branches on Monday.Certain shops face particular challenges in complying with government guidance, such as shoe retailers which now have to “quarantine” pairs that customers have tried on. Changing rooms at most clothes shops will remain closed while bookshops have said they will take items off shelves after people have touched them. Waterstones will only return items to the shop floor after 72 hours.Shops are required to install screens at checkouts and mark two-metre distance intervals on the floor to help customers stay apart. Retailers including Ikea and John Lewis have introduced social distancing wardens to help with this.As with supermarkets, numbers within non-essential stores will be strictly limited, meaning shoppers will be faced with queues outside.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailRichard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, forecasts that shopping centres will be slower to reopen than high streets because people will prefer to shop in local, familiar, open-air environments, rather than travel to large complexes.He pointed out that shopping centres often attracted consumers looking for a day out by offering an array of food options and other leisure experiences, nearly all of which will remain closed.Councils are urging shoppers to take extra care when visiting high streets and town centres to avoid a second spike in coronavirus infections.The District Councils’ Network, which represents local authorities, said it wanted the public to be reassured that safety measures would be in place for them to follow.To make visits to town centres and high streets safe, councils are carrying out more frequent street cleaning, providing hand-sanitiser posts, adapting public seating and conveniences, creating more pedestrianised spaces and streets and deploying council staff or volunteers to provide help and advice.Government ministers have also tried their best to give people the confidence to return to high streets and shopping centres. Small business minister Paul Scully told BBC Breakfast: The high street is going to be a different place to what it was before, with the one-way systems, with the hand sanitisers, and with people not trying clothes on in the same way. He echoed Boris Johnson who said on Sunday that people should shop and shop with confidence.Shops have been asked to encourage customers to shop alone unless they need extra assistance and to adjust routes around stores to minimise congestion.Given the constraints in place, retailers face a tough challenge encouraging some reluctant consumers back into stores.While there is likely to be some pent-up demand as people have the chance to browse and shop in a way they have not been able to since March, millions of consumers remain wary of public spaces while others are concerned about their finances.What are the lockdown rules now and what can you do from today?Indications from other countries is that footfall on high streets will, unsurprisingly, increase as shops reopen but that this may not translate into sales.That puts Britain’s struggling high streets in an even more perilous position as shops face high costs on rents and wages, for example, but greatly reduced revenues.David Fox, co-head of retail at property advisors Colliers, said: “Due to the social distancing measures and strict government protocols that retailers need to adhere to, there will be a mismatch of customers desire to shop and businesses ability to meet the demand. “The difficulty for retailers will be the logistics of the new health, safety and hygiene policies within the stores, with skeleton staffing to manage queueing and perform their sales duties.”Those shoppers who do venture out may be able to pick up bargains, particularly if they can hold off on purchases for a couple of weeks.Primark revealed recently that it had £1.9bn-worth of items in stock, more than double the amount it would usually hold. By one estimate, fashion retailers have around £15bn of unsold garments. Shoppers may be able to take advantage of heavy discounts as chains try to sell this excess before it falls out of fashion.However, some experts think retailers will hold off before slashing prices. Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at consultancy firm PwC said it was unlikely that consumers would see “wall-to-wall sales” this week.Many retailers have already offered big discounts online, with promotions reaching levels normally only seen on Black Friday.Ms Hooker predicts a bounce in sales this month. “If June trading does not make a big enough dent in stocks, we predict a rush of promotions and sales later in the summer.”Oxfam says charity shops are likely to be packed with “gems” as they reopen this week and fill up with items that people have cleared out during lockdown.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

However, the new numbers have sparked concern across the country that a new surge in both hospitalisations and deaths could be on the horizon.At a press conference just before the record number was reported, Mr DeSantis told reporters that numbers were going up because of an expansion in testing, including to asymptomatic people and those less at risk, and that there was no sign that major events that saw people gathering together had led to a spike in infections.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“A lot of people said ‘what about Memorial Day?’ because a lot of people thought that weekend would do something, but if you look at – from Memorial Day weekend … Miami-Dade Covid hospitalisations are down 13 per cent.

The latest spike comes along with similar rises in other states that have relaxed their measures.Among these is Arizona, which has seen cases surging day-by-day in recent weeks.

And while testing has been expanded, the rate of positive tests has markedly increased.Other states that started opening up early include Texas, where governor Greg Abbott has said the state will proceed with relaxation even as the state sees new spikes in both hospitalisations and the 7-day average number of cases.Utah and Oregon, meanwhile, have both frozen their reopening plans after seeing record highs in their daily case numbers, with governors in both states saying they need to investigate what’s driving the increases before moving ahead.Among the states only now proceeding with relaxation plans is New York, where all regions have finally met the authorities’ strict criteria to begin a phased reopening. However, governor Andrew Cuomo has warned that where local governments do not enforce regulations on distancing, the state will be prepared to reimpose lockdowns if necessary.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is white, is also in that group, as is New Mexico governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, who is Latina.The pool of prospects remains fluid, and some close Biden allies suggested other contenders could also face the more intensive vetting process. The people describing the situation spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive private conversations and an evolving search process.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Biden campaign declined to comment. Mr Biden has vowed to choose a woman, and has repeatedly stressed that he wants a running mate who is “simpatico” with him.The candidates who continue to be under consideration by the campaign reflect in part the growing prominence of African American women amid a national uproar over police violence and racism that has sparked protests around the country. These developments have added pressure on Mr Biden to select a black woman as his ticket mate.Polarized: Independent voter explains why he’s voting for BidenThe Republicans who\u0027d prefer Joe Biden might swing the electionJoe Biden delivers emotional speech at George Floyd\u0027s funeral service“I think that a ticket that is not reflective of the ersity of this country is a ticket that is doomed to fail,” said representative Marcia Fudge, who said she has long felt Mr Biden should pick a black woman and feels “even more so now”.Mr Biden\u0027s search is attracting even more attention than that of most candidates because at 77, he would be the oldest person ever elected to the presidency. Beyond potential health issues, some Democrats believe that if elected, Mr Biden might not seek a second term, giving his vice president an early advantage in the race to become the next chief executive.In a recent interview with CBS News, Mr Biden said the national upheaval of recent weeks has not affected his decision beyond placing “a greater focus and urgency on the need to get someone who is totally simpatico with where I am”.But many Biden allies believe the protests have upended the calculations Mr Biden must make. Senator Amy Klobuchar, who was once seen by Biden allies as a leading candidate, has seen her stock fall recently in their eyes.As outrage has grown over the killing of George Floyd, a black man who was killed when a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck as he cried out that he could not breathe, Ms Klobuchar\u0027s record as a local prosecutor has come under criticism from activists. They contend she was too tough on black and brown people and not hard enough on the police, contributing to systemic problems.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailAnother variable is the pressure Mr Biden faces from some quarters of the party to give strong consideration to a Latina running mate. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto took herself out of the running last month, leaving Lujan Grisham as the most prominent Latina prospect.Others who have been mentioned by Biden allies include senators Tammy Duckworth and Tammy Baldwin. Ms Duckworth is a Purple Heart recipient who lost both her legs in the Iraq War and is Asian American. Ms Baldwin hails from a crucial state Donald Trump won in 2016 and was the first openly gay person elected to the Senate.“She has an appeal that goes way beyond the obvious political candidate,” said senator Richard Durbin of Duckworth. “I believe they are taking her seriously.” Mr Durbin has been in touch with Mr Biden and his associates.Another Midwestern Democrat who has received at least some consideration is Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, who Mr Biden has previously said was on the list.The Biden campaign is expected to undertake a deep scrub of the backgrounds of its finalists, requesting documents and answers to personal questions. Those who have received close consideration in past years say the process was intense.“We got a 129-question survey to answer,” said Julian Castro, a former Housing and Urban Development secretary, who was vetted by Hillary Clinton\u0027s campaign in 2016. “You sit for hours with teams of lawyers to go over your personal, financial, political history.”New Lincoln Project election ad contrasts Trump and EisenhowerMr Biden has tasked a group of four allies - former senator Christopher J Dodd, representative Lisa Blunt Rochester, Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti and former White House counsel Cynthia Hogan - to spearhead his running mate selection process.Of the group getting a closer look from the campaign, Ms Harris stands out for her experience on the national political stage. She is the only black woman in America who is currently either a US senator or a governor, and she ran for president against Mr Biden in the Democratic primaries.Several top Biden allies said this past week that they increasingly view Ms Harris as the best fit to be Mr Biden\u0027s running mate. They believe the senator from California, a former state attorney general, could appeal to the party\u0027s activist wing as well as its professional class, helping Mr Biden meet a challenging moment of upheaval on race.Ms Rice has never sought or held elective office, but she has the most extensive record of dealing with foreign governments and representing the United States on the world stage. She served as ambassador to the United Nations and national security adviser during the Obama administration. She has faced criticism, however, for her public comments about the 2012 Benghazi attacks that killed four Americans, including two US diplomats, which she later acknowledged were not fully accurate.Ms Demings has also emerged as an intriguing prospect to many Democrats. She hails from the nation\u0027s largest swing state and made history as the first female chief of the Orlando Police Department.Representative Charlie Crist said Ms Demings “has a tremendous background” with the “added importance” of being from Florida. Mr Crist said he expressed his enthusiasm for Ms Demings on a recent call with Mr Dodd.Still, the law enforcement backgrounds of Ms Harris and Ms Demings are likely to face public scrutiny and receive close attention from the campaign officials vetting them. In recent years, liberal activists have grown more sceptical of prosecutors and police, and the current protests have focused on law enforcement\u0027s treatment of African Americans.Ms Bottoms, the Atlanta mayor, an early Biden endorser, has received national attention for her widely praised response to Floyd\u0027s killing and the resulting protests in her city.Ms Warren, who like Ms Harris ran against Mr Biden in the primaries, developed a reputation during the race as an ideas candidate with detailed plans for advancing a liberal agenda, particularly on economic issues.Art of the deal writer claims Trump is a ‘psychopath’Trump is sabotaging his own re-election campaignSome Democrats who have spoken with Mr Biden said they have not been given an indication that he is leaning towards any specific candidate. Mr Biden said at a 27 May virtual fundraiser that he hoped to name his vice-presidential pick around 1 August. “We\u0027re in the process of deciding the basic cut - about whether or not they really want it. Are they comfortable?” he said that day.Former Georgia gubernatorial nominee and state House minority leader Stacey Abrams, who has shown strong interest in the job but has drawn scepticism from some Biden allies questioning her experience, said on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert that she would answer if called, but “I have not received any calls”.The former vice president has been guarded about discussing specific candidates in his public remarks, but he has occasionally revealed some details. He has previously disclosed that Ms Demings was under consideration and said that more than one African American woman was in the mix.Mr Crist, a former Republican who was vetted by John McCain\u0027s campaign in 2008, said the experience “can be gruelling”.“It\u0027s like a no-stone-unturned kind of process,” Mr Crist said. “Which it should be.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Please consider a contribution or subscription.The United States’ coronavirus pandemic  passed another sombre milestone on Wednesday as confirmed cases surpassed two million, according to John Hopkins University data.Five US states - New York, New Jersey, California, Illinois, and Massachusetts - have seen more than 100,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases each. Almost 210,000 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in New York City alone since the US pandemic began, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhilst one million Americans contracted the virus within the initial three months of the pandemic, the past one million cases were contracted within six weeks, according to the data.  The US also continues to have more confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths – which have passed 112,000 – than any other nation.The National Center for Disaster Preparedness (NCDP), issued a warning this week that the US case count was “multiples more” than the confirmed two million.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?US authorities have otherwise claimed that high testing levels were contributing to the confirmed case count, in comparison to other states and international data.Whilst new coronavirus cases have declined in some parts of the US, including New York, there are now 20 states with rising infection rates as states ease some restrictions. California, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona are among 20 states with more cases on average in the past week, according to New York Times analysis. Arizona alone has seen, on average, more than 1,000 new cases each day this week. The highest per capita rate in the US. “It’s very clear that it’s a real increase in community spread,” Will Humble, Arizona Public Health Association executive director, told KJZZ in Phoenix. “It’s not some artifact of additional testing.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.China has removed pangolin parts from its list of traditional medicines, state-backed media reported, in a move campaigners say is a vital step in helping to protect the endangered animal.Pangolins – the world’s most trafficked mammal  – are highly sought after in China and Vietnam for their meat which is considered a delicacy, while their scales are used in traditional medicine and folk remedies.Similar in size to domestic cats and the only mammal covered in scales, all eight pangolin species are protected under international laws but there remains a growing illegal trade of the animals. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis week health authorities omitted pangolin scales from China’s latest Pharmacopoeia, an approved list of traditional drugs and remedies due to “wild resources exhaustion”, according to a report in the Health Times.WildAid CEO Peter Knights said the move was “the greatest single action that could have been taken to save pangolins from extinction.”“The increased protection coupled with the swift and comprehensive closure of live wildlife markets and removal of many wild species from the list of what can be consumed as food in China were already very positive steps to saving the pangolin worldwide and reducing the possibility of them ever being a vector for disease.“And now this announcement, effectively the closure of legal sales of pangolin scales, shutting the last major loophole in pangolin protection efforts,” he added.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) welcomed China’s decision, but urged action to stop the sale of pangolins on the black market. “PETA gives a nod to China for taking an important step to combat the demand for pangolin scales,” director Elisa Allen told The Independent.“However, as long as it remains desirable and profitable for endangered animals’ body parts to be sold for medicine, wildlife will continue to be killed on the black market.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some scientists believe they may incubate the Covid-19 virus that is thought to have emerged in Wuhan last year and has since swept the globe.Scientists find virus similar to Covid-19 in pangolinsFollowing the outbreak of coronavirus at the end of last year, China banned the consumption of all wild animals in a bid to prevent further outbreaks but many wet markets have since reopened.Earlier this year, The Independent renewed its call for the banning of trade in wild animals to help protect endangered species and avoid future pandemics.“These actions of China will have a real impact, these are steps that were critical, that needed to be taken if real conservation was going to happen for these animals,” said David Olson, director of Conservation at WWF Hong Kong.“Most of the demand for pangolin is coming from traditional Chinese medicine and consumption.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Beijing has reported 36 new Covid-19 cases for the second consecutive day, as China recorded the highest number of daily infections in two months. On Monday, Chinese authorities announced that in total there had been 49 new coronavirus cases in the country.The recent outbreak in the capital is linked to a large wholesale food market that sources much of the city’s meat and vegetables. The complex, whose size is equivalent to almost 160 soccer pitches, has been shut as a precaution and tens of thousands of nearby residents are undergoing tests for the virus. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe capital has now had 79 new cases in the last four days, the largest concentration of infection in the city since February. At a press conference on Monday, Xu Hejiang, a spokesman at the Beijing city government, said: The risk of the epidemic spreading is very high, so we should take resolute and decisive measures.”Dozens of people test positive for coronavirus in new China outbreakTrump fans cheer as he describes coronavirus as \u0027plague from China\u0027William Hague calls on UK and China to fight illegal wildlife tradeAs a result of the recent outbreak, some neighbourhoods in the west and southwest of Beijing were classified as medium-risk, which enforces strict controls on the movement of people and vehicles.One neighbourhood near the food market was upgraded to high-risk, with people being warned not to go there. As a result of the spike in the number of infections, Beijing started mass-testing on Sunday. Samples from 8,950 people who had recently been to the food market were collected, with the 6,075 tested so far coming back negative, according to a spokesperson for the Beijing public health commission. Elsewhere, some governments in other cities and provinces warned their citizens against all but essential travel to Beijing. How thousands of Chinese visitors became pawns in the Covid blame gameThis comes as the provinces of Liaoning and Hebei, in the northeast and north of the country respectively, reported a handful of cases linked to the Beijing outbreak.Sichuan in the southwest also confirmed it had one suspected case connected to the capital. Beijing health officials said a preliminary assessment of the gene sequencing of the virus shows that the food market outbreak could have originated in Europe.

So it is extremely confusing why Prince Andrew is resisting demands to meet US officials probing convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his associates.Department of Justice investigators want to speak to Andrew as a witness. Jeffrey Epstein killed himself in August last year, taking many of his depraved secrets to the grave.Despite this, Andrew has, according to US prosecutors, “repeatedly declined” a request to be interviewed and had “unequivocally” stated he would not come in for one.Instead, his lawyers say he has offered to provide a witness statement, which is not quite the same.Although I guess he knows that already, having submitted to the car crash Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis, during which he kept digging the hole he was in.If Andrew has got nothing to hide about his relationship with Jeffery Epstein, why did he request to communicate with the FBI through a written statement Friends of the duke this week claimed he was “utterly bewildered” by accusations that he was refusing to help US investigators.But it all just feels a bit . . . murky, doesn’t it He should jump at the chance of properly explaining his relationship with Epstein and his close friend Ghislaine Maxwell.She has been accused of acting as a pimp for Epstein — which her lawyers have denied — and has vanished.No doubt the duke has spent the past few months hoping this story will just go away, or be eclipsed by other, bigger news events. But clearly, this story is going nowhere.The bottom line is thatthe authorities in the US want to interview him, he must speak to them.Then he can repair his reputation and that of the wider Royal Family.He needs to restore the public’s trust in him. In his Newsnight interview he referred to himself, repeatedly, as “honourable”.Well, now is the time to prove it. Just step up, do the FBI interview and get it over and done with.And in all of this furore, let’s not forget Epstein’s victims. If Prince Andrew can shed any light on Epstein, who killed himself before he could go to trial for new sex trafficking charges, then why won’t he Perhaps he feels that, as a member of the Royal Family, he should not be subject to the same kind of scrutiny as “ordinary” people.But that line of thinking won’t cut the mustard in light of the seriousness of the allegations about Epstein — and those who benefitted from spending time with him.Anyone who watched the documentary about victim Virginia Roberts, Epstein and Prince Andrew will agree that it seems unlikely that anyone who knew Epstein would have known something was not right.I knowI had seen what is alleged, I would have walked straight out and to the first police station.But perhaps he can persuade prosecutors otherwise. And anyway, what is plain to see is that Andrew will only get his le back once he has answered some questions and cleared his name.In the meantime, though, I have another, possibly more pressing question that I would like answered: Where the hell has Ghislaine Maxwell disappeared to, and why is she not being interviewed about her role in all of this A good education closes the gap between the advantaged and the disadvantaged. The better your education, the more career choices you have.So when schools closed in March and we were all told to stay at home, a plan for how to reopen them should have been an absolute priority from day one.But schools are still closed to most children – indefinitely and with no firm or credible plan for them to reopen, even in September.We can go to Thorpe Park. We can go to Ikea. But our children cannot go to school.In the meantime, an estimated , kids are currently doing no school-work at all.No one disagrees that lockdown should have included schools. But they need to reopen as soon as it is safe to do so.That might mean cutting class sizes from  to . It might mean half-days for children or twice as many classrooms and teachers, plus proper arrangements for social-distancing.These things all need managing and organising. So why don’t schools ask local business leaders to help with the logistics This is a national crisis and it is turning into a national emergency, as the gulf between the haves and have-nots widens.Of course, some families will not be comfortable sending their children to school. If that is the case, it should be their choice not to send them.But we need to get schools open again, fast.I had a little chuckle while reading the interview with Oscar-winning actress Cate Blanchett.With her four children and long-standing marriage, she seemingly has it all.But I loved her honesty about the reality of home-schooling her kids while also trying to work during lockdown.Cate said: “I know, as a working mother who identies as a feminist . . . it’s a very rare partnership where the men also accept that responsibility in making things work.”She added that her husband, Andrew Upton, bought her a vacuum cleaner for their first anniversary and has also given her a mixer and an ironing board.It could have been me talking, except I wasn’t given a vacuum cleaner.I was given a frying pan.A hospital costs about £million but without doctors and nurses there is no point.So perhaps I would suggest the money goes towards emergency funding to train hospital staff.What would NOT be on my list, though, is a new royal yacht. Yet that is exactly what former trade minister Lord Digby Jones has called for, to lt the nation’s spirits in the wake of the Covid- lockdown.Somehow, I doubt the Queen – who famously uses Tupperware to keep her breakfast cereal fresh – would agree that a new yacht is what is needed in these tough economic times.She might deserve it but wouldn’t want it.There are so many reasons to love the flute-playing American rapper Lizzo.This week she gave us another, with a tweet showing footage of her working out in many dferent guises.A voiceover said: “I’ve been working out consistently for the past five years – and it may come as a surprise to some of y’all that I’m not working out to have your ideal body type.“I’m working out to have MY ideal body type.“And you know what that is  None of your fing business. Because I am beautul. I am strong. I do my job.”I love this message, which is true in so many ways. I really hope women, young and old, take note. Love yourself and, seriously, don’t give a rat’s a what anyone  thinks.Litter – and worse.One green space near me has a sign up saying: “This is a park, not a toilet.”What happened to us during lockdown that we think it is OK to behave like this  Come on, people. We can do better.Having said that, maybe the council needs to put out some more bins.In the Nineties, it seemed barely a day went by without front-page shots of Kate Moss looking worse for wear after a night on the tiles.But those days are gone and there is something strangely comforting about Kate, who is now teetotal, needing to be in bed by pm so she gets her eight hours.Maybe that’s why she still looks so good. She spent years being there and doing that – now it’s time to get her beauty sleep.Not drinking has many benefits. I feel so much better at the end of Dry January than I do end after boozy December. Good for her.It was heartwarming to see Prince Philip in such fine fettle as he turned  last week.I love how dapper he still is.

It means the kind of face covering you can easily make at home.”If you’re found not wearing a face covering, you might be refused travel and could face a fine of up to £ - or £paid in  days.There will be exceptions for young kids and disabled people.Also, all hospital visitors must wear face coverings from June .Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas in England are allowed to reopen too.The announcement came amid fears that some zoos would be bankruptedforced to stay closed over the summer.Edward Perry, managing director of Knowsley Safari, in Merseyside, said while it was “very good news”, he wanted the park to have reopened sooner.He commented: “Knowsley Safari has been ready for the past week to safely open to the public and we still can’t understand why it’s been OK for people to jump in their cars to go and get Big Macs but not to come and see our big cats.”However, the Prime Minister has said that some zoo areas will still be off limits – in particular indoor areas like reptile houses.Places of worship across England also opened their doors today.But large gatherings will still not be allowed, meaning people can only pray while following social distancing rules.The Government has said that all churches will need to be cleaned regularly, and books cannot be shared.Places of worship havent been open since March , when lockdown began.There are also set to be some big changes in the classroom, with Year  and Year  pupils allowed back in waves.The Government has announced that only a quarter of kids will be allowed in school at a time – meaning that for some kids, they could get just one full day of teaching each week.Classrooms will have undergone some huge changes since March, with less desks, more frequent cleaning, and only minimal contact between pupils.When they’re not at school, children will still be required to complete remote learning, with the Government saying it should remain “the predominant mode of education”.Plans for other years toto the classroom have been delayed, with the Education Secretary last week saying that not all primary school kids will go back before summer.“We are not able to welcome all primary children back for a full month before the summer,” Gavin Williamson admitted on Tuesday.Some of the biggest changes are still to come, with bars and pubs still shut and the two-metre rule still being enforced.The Government has said that most other shops will be allowed to reopen from July  at the earliest – meaning Brits can get a proper haircut for the first time in months.Meanwhile, social distancing rules are currently under review, with the Government’s scientic advisers looking into whether it can be reduced.This would mean that shops, boozers and restaurants could let more customers in.Air bridges between the UK and other countries – which could see Brits allowed on summer holidays – are also yet to be agreed.Brits who go abroad now must self-isolate for two weeks when theyto the country.However, air bridges could be agreed by June , with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps saying last week that the Government is “actively working” on them.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the new book, serialised in the \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Mail on Sunday, it is revealed that some lions are deboned while they are still ALIVE because it gives the skeleton a lucrative pink colour – caused by blood being left in the bones. Unfair Game details a covert operation by security services, including ex-British soldiers, to expose the vile industry by using a dealer as an undercover “double agent.” One of the most serious claims by ex-Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft is that the lions which are born into captivity are raised in such disgusting conditions that they could spread fatal diseases such as tuberculosis and botulism. Dr Peter Caldwell, a wildle vet in Pretoria, said botulism – an infection which attacks the nervous system – could spread to people through infected bones and skin. He said: “If that lion dies from botulism, the people who bred it won’t waste that animal by burying it or burning it. Instead, they will put it into the lion bone and skin trade. “And the toxin remains in the body, so the people who utilise that lion can die a miserable, painful death.”Other diseases spread by lion bones include brucellosis - an infection that causes arthritis and inflammation of the heart - and tuberculosis, which killed . million people globally in .Another shocking claim in the book is that a rich Russian paid one of the farms to let his bloodthirsty pack of hunting dogs savage one of the caged lions to death. When Lord Ashcroft’s lead investigator, who carried out an eight-month probe, presented his evidence to a South African police chief it was rejected and he was told he was “lucky” he was not in jail. The book estimates there are at least , lions, bred in captivity in South Africa, compared to just , in the wild. Sick farm bosses let wealthy hunters into the enclosures to kill the big cats for sport in so-called “canned hunts” which result in , lion deaths every year. Investigators also found that poachers hunt and kill wild lions in neighbouring Botswana by poisoning or shooting them in the stomachs to protect the precious bones. A lion skeleton is worth up to £,. And in sick markets in Johannesburg, lion bones and skins are sold alongside exotic animals such as pangolins – a creature which has been linked to Covid-.Lord Ashcroft writes: So are we sleep-walking straight into a new major public health crisis with the lion bone industry at its core  I fear we are.

The prince has long faced questions about his friendship with financier Epstein, who killed himself in August while awaiting trial on federal charges for the sex trafficking of minors. He was widely criticised for a November interview with the BBCs Emily Maitlis for, among other things, saying he didnt regret the association because it had helped him make contacts that proved useful for his work as a royal. Speaking to the Sunday Times, a source close to the duke said: “I don’t think he regrets the intention behind the interview, which was to clear the air for his family, the royal family and the institution. But the fact he was unable to appropriately or sufficiently convey his sympathy for the victims of Epstein, is of course a source of regret.”Virgina Roberts, who claims she had sex with Andrew aged  after being trafficked by Epstein, took to twitter to respond to the reports. Oh the gull of this toad - he regrets the BBC interview but not his friendship with Epstein because it gave him great contacts and much more, she wrote. This man is not a prince but a facet of insidiousness who has proven to get away with it all.Prince Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing. Recent weeks have also seen the princes legal team engage in a war of words with FBI prosecutors leading the probe into Epsteins crimes. Each side has publicly blamed the other for the fact Andrew is yet to be questioned at part of the investigation. It was reported last week that the US Department of Justice had submitted a formal request to the Home Office for assistance in speaking with Andrew as a witness. The dukes team responded by claiming he had offered his assistance as a witness to the DoJ on at least three occasions since the start of this year, and that the DoJ had breached its own confidentiality rules.Lead federal prosecutor Geoffrey Berman said in response that the prince ly [seeking to] portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate. The prince has... repeatedly declined our request to schedule... an interview and nearly four months ago informed us unequivocally... that he would not come in for such an interview, Berman said.The duke is now reported to be unwilling to help with the probe unless US officials begin to work more honourably.

My focus, however, has been on exposing those who raise captive-bred lions, either for their bones or as so-called “trophies” in “canned” hunts, where the lion — sometimes semi-tame and drugged — is shot in an enclosed area with no chance of escape.In an exclusive interview to mark the publication of my new book Unfair Game: An Exposé Of South Africa’s Captive-Bred Lion Industry, which is out tomorrow, Kevin, , spoke about his determination to make a dference.He said he is now prouder of his off-the-pitch exploits relating to wildle than of his cricketing achievements.“I am pleased that I found something that I am keen to do but also I think it is so much greater than any achievement I had on the cricket field,” he said.Sitting in a private room at the Wentworth Club in Surrey, close to his family home, Kevin told me that his love of wild animals stems from his childhood.He was born in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, in  to an Afrikaner father and an English mother .He said: “A lot of people talk about ‘you are not born in Africa, Africa is born in you’, and that’s so true.“As an African kid, as a boy of the soil, I appreciated what was in the country. And wildle was right up there.”As a youngster, Kevin and his three brothers were taken on safari by his parents to the Kruger National Park in South Africa.“We saw some pretty amazing sights,” he said. His passion for wildle continued during his cricket career, when he often went on safari with family and friends to enjoy watching the “big five”  —  lion, leopard, rhino, elephant and African buffalo.However, his attitude to wildle underwent a major change when he travelled with two friends to South Africa in .Kevin said: “I had just finished with England. After playing a charity game, we went to a couple of safari lodges and went on a rhino micro-chipping experience, where you chip the horn for tracking purposes andthe rhino is poached. Only then did I appreciate what was happening to this beautul, iconic species.“So from  my focus and drive shted away from the international sporting buzz to a much-needed and much more necessary conservation plan. I realised quite what an issue rhino-poaching was, and I realised that I could make a dference by raising awareness, by raising money and by being a voice for an animal that has no voice.“So since  I have been banging the drum about what’s happening in Africa. I can’t tell you how many people now approach me to talk about conservation and not about cricket. The change has been fabulous. To sht from being identied as a familiar face through sport to going into a dferent world where people love animals is something I am incredibly proud of.”As well as establishing a luxury lodge on the edge of the Kruger National Park, Kevin has founded campaign group Save Our Rhino Africa India .It works to help prevent poaching for rhino horn, care for injured and orphaned rhino and to educate people about the fact that the five species of rhino face extinction, with fewer than , left in Africa and Asia.In Africa alone, there are fewer than , white rhinos and for black rhinos the number is below ,. Father-of-two Kevin, who is married to former Liberty X singer Jessica Taylor, spoke emotionally about his love for rhinos: “What is Africa without one of the ‘big five’  What is the world without one of the ‘big five’  That is why the rhino, which is crucially endangered, means so much to me. I just have this love affair with this animal that we are desperate to save.”Kevin is realistic when it comes to the occasional need to kill wild animals.While he strongly opposes trophy-hunting and the hunting of endangered species, he considers that hunting for food and culling wildle can both be legitimate in certain circumstances.“I am just a vocal campaigner on things I don’t think are right, whether it be bullying or plastics in the ocean or protecting wildle,” he said.Many of his strong views, including his anger towards trophy hunters, are aired on his Twitter feed, where he has .million followers.On Twitter, Kevin has highlighted my own wildle work.Last year, I revealed the full horrors of “lion farming” in South Africa, where some , captive lions are bred either for their bones — largely to serve an Asian market — or as “trophies”, most killed in the pretence of a “hunt”.In Africa, captive-bred lions now outnumber wild lions by around four to one. I asked Kevin whether he is ashamed of how some people in the country of his birth abuse lions, the so-called “King Of The Jungle.”He replied: “Absolutely right. I do not understand the end game, the end user, the person that pulls the trigger. I do not understand how you would want to take money out of your pocket to shoot an animal that has been born and raised to be shot.“I don’t understand the brain inside the head that says ‘Look at me in this photo’ [next to a dead wild animal — known as the ‘kill shot’]. It’s just not a space that I live in. It’s just not a world that I live in.“It’s pretty disgusting really to do such a thing. In this trophy photo, you see they [the so-called hunters] are smiling or laughing next to this majestic animal. For me it’s an absolute no-go.”Kevin said that he has long been aware that lion farming and canned hunting exist in South Africa. “It is something that can be stopped and should be stopped.“The human race doesn’t surprise me any more and that’s such a sad thing to say. There are some filthy people out there that don’t have any feeling for animals.”Like me, Kevin wants the UK Government to change the law so that body parts of endangered species can no longer be imported into the country.“I am  per cent against this importation,” he said.Kevin is disappointed the South African government and police have so far refused to act on information I supplied from two undercover investigations which I commissioned.These resulted in my team secretly filming, and eventually identying, many of those guilty of criminal offences. Yet Kevin is not that surprised by the inaction.“In all honestly, South Africa has such big issues — lack of electricity, blood-shedding, corruption within the government who have been looting the country for so many years, that I don’t think this wildle issue is high on their agendaI can be brutally honest,” he said, speaking shortly before the coronavirus pandemic.My respect for Kevin and his work is immense. Unlike many talented sportsman whose careers end because of age or injury, he has a real purpose to his le since retiring as a professional cricketer two years ago.“I did almost everything in the game of cricket, but being able to be a huge voice and a campaigner to try to keep a species alive is . . . something that I love,” he said. Kevin believes his work as a conservationist will be ongoing.“I don’t think it will ever be complete. Unfortunately these horrible people are seeing so much financial gain from killing these animals that it is going to take a lot of amazing people to constantly keep banging the drum to save our animals.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some may never catch up.“This policy isn’t a silver bullet and can’t replace months of missed education.

For the first time in three months youaposll be able to go clothes shopping and see the lemurs. But there will be strict social distancing rules in place and firms will be ordered to carry out more hygiene measures than usual. Expect queues outside shops and high demand for tickets for attractions allowed to reopen. Meanwhile, people who live alone or single parents are allowed to form a bubble with one other household in England. This means breaking the two-metre rule for the first time to hug and kiss, share childcare, stay the night and have sexthataposs your thing. Hereaposs everything you need to know about the lockdown changes this week. Two separate households in England can now join together in a “support bubble” under certain conditions. They won’t need to follow the two-metre rule - meaning they can hug, kiss, share childcare and meals, hang out indoors, stay the night and even have sex for the first time since March . One of the two households in each bubble must be a “single-adult household”. This means either a person who lives alone, or a single parent who lives with children under . There’s an incredible £million of funding from The National Lottery being shared among good causes around the UK – and it’s all thanks to you. Le’s been harder than ever for young carers in lockdown. But charities like TEN North East are offering vital support thanks to National Lottery funding. Program lead Levi Cosker  says: One mother calls our project a leline – without us she wouldn’t have any support. Click here to read her amazing full story. Visit national-lottery news to learn more about how you’re helping. The other household they are joining with can be of any size, and can have more than one adult in it. However, in total each bubble must only consist of two households - and each household must keep the arrangement “exclusive”. That means a person living alone cannot form multiple bubbles with multiple households. Likewise, a family cannot form multiple bubbles with more than one lonely relative.

What changes in England from June  Non-essential shops reopen  Non-essential shops will be allowed to reopen for the first time for almost three months in England. Stories will need strict social distancing measures, much like those weaposve already seen in supermarkets and other essential stores. Brands vowing to reopen bang on time from June  include Primark, GAME, Debenhams, O, EE and BT, HM, Lush, GAME, H Samuel and Argos. John Lewis is set to open most stores from June , while Next will open a handful followed by others in the coming weeks. Types of shop allowed to reopen include:Fashion shops Charity shops Betting shops and arcades Tailors, dress fitters and fashion designers Auction houses Antique stores Retail art galleries Photography studios Gt shops and retail spaces in theatres, museums, libraries, heritage sites and tourism sites Mobile phone stores Craft fairsFace coverings will be mandatory on public transport  Everyone travelling on public transport in England will be required to wear a face covering from June . Wearing a face covering - not a surgical mask - will be part of the conditions of carriage for travelling on public transport. That means travellers could be refused permission to board buses or trainsthey refuse to comply with the order. Serious offenders could be fined, but ministers have claimed people will largely comply and this wonapost be needed.  Hospital visitors and staff will need to wear face coverings and masks All hospital visitors and outpatients in England will be required to wear face coverings - while all hospital staff will be required to wear higher-grade, type  or  surgical masks. Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemasstart to re-open  Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas are set to reopen in England from Monday. Boris Johnson has said they can reopen as long as they follow social distancing rules. That means their on-site cafes and restaurants are expected to operate as take-away only. Only outdoor attractions are allowed to reopen, so reptile houses and indoor aquariums will remain closed. Sites will be operating at reduced capacity, and there may be one-way systems in place. And of course, because very few things are likely to be open it will be busy, you should book your ticket online in advance to ensure youaposre not disappointed when you turn up. Churches reopen but only for private prayer  Places of worship reopen in England from June , but only for private prayer and not for services. Iniduals are expected to be able to reflect and pray while adhering to social-distancing rules - but worship groups, weddings and other services will still not be permitted. In line with government guidance churches will be expected to be deep-cleaned regularly and should remove shared books from public areas. Churches have been closed since  March, following instructions from the Government. School pupils in Years  and a quarter at a time  Secondary schools in England can reopen for Years  and  from June , but not all students will be allowed toat the same time. Only a quarter of eligible pupils will be allowed in school at any one time - meaning schools have had to instigate special timetables and classes to make the system work. Secondary schools are not likely to fully reopen until September at the earliest. Students who dowill be encouraged to travel separately and avoid public transport. The teaching of vulnerable children and those of critical workers in all year groups will continue until the start of the summer holidays. Some primary schools will open a bit further than they are now While around half of the UKaposs primary schools have been open to more pupils from June , some have remained closed to all but key workersapos kids. This meant nursery, reception, year one and year six pupils in some parts of the country havenapost yet got back into the classroom. Some places, like Doncaster and Liverpool, stopped schools reopening on June , but will see them reopening their doors on Monday. Donapost expect more big changes to primary school attendance before September though. Plans for all pupils in Years , ,  and  tofor a month before the summer break in England have been dropped by Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Instead schools are just being asked to bring back whoever they can, depending on capacity. He told MPs he is now aiming to get all children back to school in September,possible. What has already changed in recent weeks in EnglandJune : Primary schools were asked to reopen to years R,  and  in England - though only about half of them actually did June : People allowed to meet in socially-distanced groups of up to  outdoors, including in private gardens June : Car showrooms and outdoor markets allowed to reopen June : Dentists begin to reopen with extra hygiene measures in place June : -day quarantine comes into forced for those arriving in the UK June : Some parking charges that were suspended . What weaposll still need to wait until July for - or longer Pubs, restaurants and bars Pubs, restaurants, bars and cafes are not expected to reopen in England until July  at the earliest. They can already operate as takeaways - good news for pubs next to parks or beaches - but they canapost have people drinking on the premises, even in the beer garden. Pubs arenapost guaranteed to reopen on July  - thataposs just the starting date for the hospitality and leisure industry so boozers might come later. When they do open itaposll have to be with social distancing rules in place. Hairdressers and nail bars  Hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons are also only opening from July  at the earliest. And like pubs, the date could end up being later because itaposs hard to avoid being in close contact with someone cutting your hair. The two-metre rule Boris Johnson is under pressure to drop the two-metre social distancing rule down to one metre or one and a half. This would increase the risk of catching the virus from someone but allow the economy to restart. The government has made clear that the two-metre rule is still in all its guidance, including draft rules for pubs and cafes to reopen. But that could change in future. Boris Johnson has said he wants to cut the distance but only when itaposs supported by the science. In basic terms, that means waiting until your overall risk from catching the virus in wider society is so low, some extra risk from the person youaposre next to is acceptable. Scientists say youaposre  to  times more at risk from one metre away than two metres away.

David Lammy hit out after being asked by the BBC: Do you believe there is a thing called white privilege The campaigning MP explained the concept - and argued it was gaslighting to askprivilege or racism exist in Britain today.He went on to blast Boris Johnson for announcing a Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities - but burying it in an article about why Winston Churchillaposs statue should not be removed.Mr Lammy told Radio aposs Today programme the Tories were trying to distract from the real issues. The only person who wants to focus on Winston Churchill’s statue is the Conservative Party, and frankly it’s bizarre, he said. They want a culture war because they want to distract from the central issue. Implement the reviews! Do something! Change it! You’re in power, you’ve been in power for a decade! The clash comes after weeks of Black Lives Matter protests against the death of George Floyd, who was killed at the hands of US police. Boris Johnson has declared black lives matter and last night announced a Commission to look at racial inequality in the UK.  But Mr Lammy branded it a back of a fag packet scheme after Mr Johnson failed to announce its timetable, staffing or remit.He said the PM must announce changes now - and start by implementing dozens of recommendations from past reviews that arenapost yet in place.A row also erupted because Mr Johnson said he wants to change the narrative so we stop the sense of victimisation and discrimination. Critics hit back at the PM for mentioning a sense of racism as well as the racism itself.  Amid the row, Mr Lammy was asked by BBC interviewer Justin Webbthere was such a thing as white privilege. He replied: Look, there will be people listening who are working class, who are poor, they may be in northern constituencies - they’re not feeling particularly privileged, they’re having a tough time in a Britain that suffered from austerity. But when people talk about white privilege they’re not saying your le isn’t hard or tough or a challenge because of the class issues that remain in Britain - what they’re saying is race is not one of the things that makes it harder. And I think in a sense - I feel like I’m being gaslightedwe ask questions like ‘does white privilege or does racism exist’.  Frankly, given all the art that has been made, all the writing that has been delivered, whether in reviews or black writing, all the comedy that has been made that’s made people laugh - of course those things still exist in our society. The time now is frankly for majority culture to do something about it. Mr Lammy went on to say it is deeply worrying and frankly immature that Britain is still having a conversation about whether racism actually exists.

Married couples or those in civil partnerships  who have reported they are suffering from aposhighapos levels of anxiety more than doubled in the first month of Britainaposs shutdown.Pensioners aged over  were also twice as likely to be highly stressed as those aged -, the ONS found, with part of the blame being attributed to reporting of their higher risk of serious illness and death from coronavirus, and also their higher levels of loneliness.Both of these groups, married couples and pensioners, reported the lowest anxiety levels pre-pandemic.The figures come after the rules were relaced allowing  apossupport bubblesapos containing two households, to help those living alone. Since lockdown was formally introduced on March  families have suffered from not seeing their loved ones and having to balance working from home and childcare. The over s have been told to stay indoors as mush as possible and those labeled as aposclinically vulnerableapos due to pre-existing conditions ordered to shield. An estimated ,of those classed as clinically vulnerable report a worsening in their mental health since receiving shielding guidance. The majorityof clinically extremely vulnerablepeople reported no dference in their mental health and well-being. The figures reveal that the group finding the situation hardest were married couples and those in civil partnerships. Almost one in fiveBut that rose to almost one in four . Those who are married or in a civil partnership are more likely to be balancing homeschooling alongside other commitments.A quarter of them are homeschooling during the pandemic, compared with approximately  in  people who are single, separated or orced.Between  April and  May  a higher percentage of those who are married or in a civil partnership also said that homeschooling was negatively affecting their well-beingwhen compared with all other marital status groups .Around one in five of those who reported high levels of anxiety during lockdown said that their work had been affected because they were finding working from home dficult, the ONS said. Overall feeling lonely was the factor most strongly associated with reporting high anxiety – people who often or always felt lonely were almost five times more likely to report high anxiety than those who “never” feel lonely.Dawn Snape, assistant director of the ONSaposs sustainability and inequalities ision, said: There is understandable concern about the impact of the pandemic on peopleaposs well-being.  Our figures show that the equivalent of  million adults in Great Britain report high levels of anxiety.One particularly striking finding is that % of people who are married or in a civil partnership, reported high levels of anxiety. This compares with % pre-pandemic.It may in part be because of the challenges of homeschooling alongside work and other responsibilities.Another marked change is in those aged  years or older.

She has set up a free online water course which is suitable for people of all ages and teaches you what to doyou get into trouble, or see someone in the water. Kirsty also gives talks on water safety and is determined not to let another family go through what hers still does, every day.  She said: Shane went into cold water shock, itaposs a strong power that stops you being able to shout for help. You canapost move your arms and legs to be able to swim and your heart rate rises. Shane was intoxicated, so everything would have been heightened too. Every year  men drown after a night out in the UK, and  more people drown while fishing.Another  also drown while out on a walk or run, and the majority had no intention of going into the water. Kirsty added: Even though it is warm at the moment, the water is still so cold. When cold water shock happens, you arenapost going to make it out. It takes over your body.

Northern Ireland is adopting a similar relaxation of the regulations for people living alone. Adults living alone or single parents living with children under the age of  can form a bubble with one other household which means they will effectively be treated as a single household for the purpose of the lockdown rules. That means they can visit each other indoors in their homes - staying overnightthey wish - and they will not have to observe the two-metre social-distancing rule. These bubbles are strictly exclusive - neither household can form a bubble with anyone . It means elderly people living alone could form a bubble with the household of an adult son or daughter enabling them to visit and even hug their grandchildren for the first time since lockdown. Single parents could pair up with their own parents allowing them to share childcare duties and reuniting grandparents and grandchildren. And couples who do not live together will be able to visit and to stay with each other.  But some scientists have advised against social bubbles. A SAGE report of its meeting on May  said: Sage advised that social bubbles have the potential to create signicant unwanted effects and advised against their introduction in the short term, when other distancing measures have only just been lted or in conjunction with release of other measures. Sage advised strong caution concerning the introduction of social bubbling - particularly in the short term, when other distancing measures have only just been lted or in conjunction with release of other measures.

The Queen, who was dressed in a floral silk jade grey and dusty pink dress by Stewart Parvin and hat by Rachel Trevor-Morgan, with the diamond leek brooch of the Welsh Guard, sat alone on a seat on a dais, a raised  decorated with pink begonias and bay trees to watch.  And royal blog Gertaposs Royals spotted some other people enjoying the view, leaning out the palace windows to watch.Itaposs unknown who the lucky spectators are, but theyaposre believed to be castle staff. Even though they couldnapost be there in person, the rest of the royal family didnapost miss out and reportedly tuned in to watch the coverage on the BBC.The event was the Queenaposs first live public engagement since Britain was placed into lockdown because of coronavirus. The parade included  socially distanced soldiers from the st Battalion Welsh Guards - including the first ever female guardsman to parade for the Queen’s birthday. Her Majesty looked on with pride at the assembled military outfit, accompanied by Vice-Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt, Master of the Household, Lt Col Michael Vernon, Comptroller and Major Nana Twemasi-Ankrah, the Queen’s equerry.

So she was horried when she found her beloved pooch vomiting blood and rushed him to the vet for tests. Four-year-old Bailey was diagnosed with pancreatitis, a painful inflammation of the organ that can be caused by obesity, and was put on anti-inflammatory medication for two weeks and a diet overhaul was recommended. Alicia, from Watton, Norfolk, said: When youaposre a dog owner you think youaposre doing the very best for your dog. So we really took it to heart when we found out we had contributed to his illness. We felt like weaposd let ourselves down - heaposs our everything. Alicia, , and her boyfriend, Liam Applegarth, , who is in the armed forces, admitted they didnapost know too much about dog nutrition so just bought a bag of food from the supermarket which claimed to be perfect for an all round diet But after his health scare, theyaposve swapped him to a raw food diet and the dference is incredible. She said: I just couldnapost believe how quickly he took to it. It grossed me out at first, the idea of using raw meat, but when you think about it dogs werenapost made to eat kibble.  In the wild theyaposd be eating food theyaposd caught. Between starting his new diet August  and the summer of , Bailey shed half his body weight, slimming down from kg to kg - drawing admiring comments from fellow dog walkers who had known him since he was a puppy. Friends, family and fellow dog walkers were lost for words,said Alicia, who is also delighted to report that he has never suffered with pancreatitis again. The vet was absolutely shocked. He couldnapost believe it, I donapost think he could believe that such dference was made by swapping to raw food  - and heaposs a vet!  And when I started looking at old photos, I realised why everyone was making such a fuss - he really was a super slimming pooch. Alicia and Liam had wanted a dog since they first moved in together, in June , but it had been impossible as they were living in rented accommodation. So, after buying their own place in , getting a puppy had been their priority and they had settled on a Cocker Spaniel, as they thought the breed would suit their personalities and lestyle. Alicia said:  We wanted an active, lively dog to fit in with our lestyle, as weaposre a young couple and quite active - so a Cocker Spaniel ticked all the boxes.  Theyaposre known for their kooky personalities, after all. Falling head over heels for Bailey, who they bought from a local breeder, he made their little family feel complete. Alicia said: He was everything we could have hoped for in a first pet. He was your perfect puppy, so friendly and engaging. He was so happy to see anybody. Wanting to be responsible, they had decided to have him neutered - heeding the warnings that his metabolism might slow, causing him to gain a few kilos, by exercising portion control. Alicia said: We gave him strict portions of a generic, supermarket-bought kibble, as well as daily short walks and a three-hour walk once a week.  So the couple were flummoxed by what was causing his considerable weight gain  - only realising once Alicia started researching alternative diets on the web that it was probably the kind of food they had been giving him. Looking back, we know now it was the kibble that was the weight gain culprit, but we didnapost know anything about nutrition for dogs back then. We just chose the most colourful brand, which made the best claims about dog health. He went from being an energetic, fun-loving dog to a lethargic and lazy hound. Recalling the upsetting day they realised how poorly Bailey was, she said: I woke up one morning and could hear Bailey retching at the bottom of the bed.  Liam was away with the forces at the time. I got up to let Bailey out and he ran into the garden and would not stop throwing up. At first I thought it was just an upset stomach. He didnapost eat anything that day, and the next he was vomiting up blood - it was terrying.  They rushed him to the vet where he was put on a drip for  hours and given a full health screening - including an ultrasound and blood tests. She started researching alternative diets and came across Natureaposs Menu - and hasnapost looked back. She said: He looks like a completely dferent dog.

The students are all set to sit their GCSEs and A-level next summer but due to social distancing rules the size of classes have shrunk dramatically. The Government wants pupils to have aposface-to-faceapos support before they sit their exams but the amount contact time available will y from school to school. While some are offering ‘weekly contact sessions’ for pupils or prioritising contact for those who have ‘struggled’ with remote learning an estimated one in eight schools will remain closed. A survey of more than , workers at state secondary schools by app provider, Teacher Tapp, found that  per cent will resume lessons for students beyond key worker children next week.  But according to the findings published in Schools Week,  per cent will either reopen from June , June  or at a ‘later date before the summer’.Three per cent of respondents said their secondary school will stay closed until the autumn term while five per cent said a decision had not been made as yet. Ten per cent of respondents said their school had already reopened. The findings come after Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs the Government is aiming for all schools to reopened by September, and students will set their GCSE and A-level next year.  Primary schools in England have begun resuming lessons for children in nursery, Reception, Year  and Year  since June . However research by the Association of School and College Leadersfound that  per cent of secondary schools and colleges will not reopen from Monday mainly due to concerns of coronavirus spreading. ASCL said provisions dfer between inidual schools and colleges due to social distancing rules. Many schools and colleges are planning ‘weekly, or more than weekly contact sessions, for all eligible pupils, while others have dferent arrangements for Year  and Year pupils’.  Some schools and colleges are ‘prioritising more contact for pupils who have struggled with remote learning’, ‘providing review sessions’ for all or ‘building the frequency of contact sessions over time’. At Heathfield Community College in East Sussex, around  per cent of year  pupils will not be ing with their peers next week with headteacher Caroline Barlow blaming the school’s rural location. She told Schools Week: A lot of parents don’t want to put their kids on the buses.

Many refugees and asylum seekers endure long, painful and desperate journeys - travelling by overcrowded boats, cramped lorries or on foot as they trek in search of safety. They don’t want to leave their home countries, their family and friends, but when war breaks out they are left with no other option. Tens of thousands of refugees have arrived in the UK in recent years and the majority have grabbed every opportunity they can to make a better le for themselves in their new homeland by studying, volunteering, working and starting their own businesses. Today marks the first day of Refugee Week  , celebrating the contributions, resilience and creativity of refugees. This yearaposs theme is Imagine, and there will be an online programme of virtual workshops and activities. To mark Refugee Week, weaposve spoken to refugees and asylum seekers, many of whom have been volunteering tirelessly during the Covid- pandemic, about their new lives. Mahmoud Juma is a stall manager at Breadwinners Mahmoud came to England at the age of  without any family or friends. The journey from his home country Sudan took more than a year. Since then, he has been building his confidence and recently enrolled at college to study ESOL. He has also joined Breadwinners - a charity and social enterprise, which sees refugees and asylum seekers sell artisan bread on market stalls across London and has been delivering supplies during the Covid crisis. Mahmoud is now a stall manager for their Victoria Park branch. He is also supported by the Dost Centre, which works with newly-arrived young refugees and newly-arrived migrants.  Mahmoud, , says: “Before joining Breadwinners I didn’t have any confidence, I didn’t know any English, but since running the market I have met many dferent people from dferent cultures. It has helped my confidence and I really enjoy it. When I came to England I felt very lucky, because it was the safest place. It was a very, very painful and tough journey to get here. I faced a lot of challenges. When I first arrived I felt alone and I had no support until I came across some charities including Dost Centre. It was Marian from the Dost Centre who told me about the Breadwinners programme. It is great because I have been able to go camping, play football and make new friends thanks to the support from the centre. I feel this is the beginning of my future. During the Covid- crisis, I have delivered bread to  homes, through our new online orders. I have learnt a lot of skills from Breadwinners which will be valuable for my CV. I have a mentor with Breadwinners who has given me a lot of support, she has been texting me everyday to check I am okay during lockdown. In the future I would like to study and do a job in IT and technology.”  Since Breadwinners was set up in , they have helped  refugees and asylum seekers through their two programmes, Risers and Breadwinners. Risers supports young people who are seeking asylum by giving them work experience as market stall assistants. They also provide training and mentoring so they can build their skills and CV for future employment. The Breadwinners programme supports refugees with newly received status who are struggling to find work by providing opportunities for their first employment in the UK. They work as market stall managers, earning the UK Living Wage, until they are ready to find full time jobs or run their own business. Martin Campos, director at Breadwinners, says: The people we support have something very special, they have gone through so much and faced a lot of challenges, they will cherish every opportunity. It is crazy to see how the people we work with develop and how far they come, from when they first started with us. Some of the people we have supported have gone on to work in nursing, the tourism industry, sales and waitering. Zak Mohammed volunteers to deliver food parcels for Hope charity Zak, who is an asylum seeker, came to England in  from East Africa, but he has chosen not to share his past as he finds it too traumatic. Instead he has chosen to look at the positives in his le and is “thankful” for each day and is passionate about helping others. He is a volunteer with Hope - a Christian charity which works with local churches and community groups to support those in need. The Nottingham-based charity also helps to run food banks in the city. Since the start of the pandemic, Zak has delivered around  food parcels a week for the past two months to residents in need with charity volunteer and friend Julie James. He is also a volunteer with Derbyshire Refugee Solidarity and in the past, he has volunteered with a charity which supports children with disabilities called Umbrella and with Sue Ryder.  Zak, , says: “It feels good to help others, I enjoy volunteering. Everyone is dferent, some people like volunteering and doing something to keep busy, but it doesn’t always suit everyone. When I first came to this country I felt alone and I didn’t know anyone and I had nothing to do, which stressed me out. But now I volunteer with the Hope charity, I volunteer with the Derbyshire Refugee Solidarity and I am a keen runner so I have joined a running club in Derbyshire too. I have been delivering food parcels for Hope for about eight weeks now, it has helped me to continue learning English, I meet dferent people, and I have learnt more about Nottingham too. I don’t have any plans for the future, because I have learnt to take each day at a time and to just be happy.” Julie James, a former teacher of  years, now works in the charity sector focusing on refugees and asylum seekers. Julie, , from Nottingham, said: “Every refugee and asylum seeker who I have worked with has wanted to contribute to society in some way or another, or they’ve looked for paid employment and this needs to be celebrated. Through the charities I work with, refugees and asylum seekers have taken part in fundraising, volunteering and day trips out.”Mazin Saad volunteers to deliver food parcels and has been working at the Covid- testing centre Mazin, who is from Sudan, came to this country in  after a seven month journey. He has lived in Doncaster, South Yorkshire and most recently moved to London and was granted refugee status two years ago. Since the start of the Covid- pandemic, Mazin has been volunteering by delivering food parcels to refugees and asylum seekers in his local community. He also worked at a Covid- testing centre in March and he is now in the process of setting up a charity called Sudanese Solidarity Organisation, alongside his day job as a security officer. Mazin is also a member of the Good Chance Theatre where he regularly takes part in shows and workshops. He recently performed a poem about his journey to England for the theatre’s Migration Matters show.  Mazin, , says: Since the moment I was rescued as an asylum seeker by the Royal Navy, I have felt this country has given me so much that I want to give back. I have so many people to thank. During the pandemic I have been helping refugees and asylum seekers to make sure they have food and any support they need. I am looking to continue this work by setting up a charity called Sudanese Solidarity Organisation, we’re in the process of getting it set up and we have just done the logo. We want to eventually reach out to other countries and help as many people as possible. In this country the gap between refugees and asylum seekers is big, asylum seekers have very little money to live on, they need more support.  Over the years I have volunteered with the likes of British Red Cross and British Heart Foundation. It has helped with my confidence and it has allowed me to understand dferent cultures. I have met many dferent people through my volunteer work and have taken part in many social activities, especially with Good Chance Theatre. It has been great to engage in their workshops and help with fundraising too. Before the Covid- pandemic started, I was studying for a foundation course, which I am hoping to continue, which will hopefully allow me to enrol for an undergraduate course.Teem Khan, is an NHS worker, who also has his own fashion brand. He has been making masks. Teem, who is from East Africa, came to this country as a student in . He studied Travel and Tourism. After a y and challenging four year process, Teem went from being an asylum seeker to being granted refugee status  months ago. Teem, who lives in London, has recently started working for the NHS as a warehouse supervisor. Teem has recently started his own fashion brand, with the help of TERN - an organisation which helps refugees start a business. Teem has been making masks during the pandemic. Teem, , says: The process to become a refugee has ruined my mental health, it has been very traumatic, I was not able to work which was very hard for me. It still affects my anxiety today. However I had a lot of support from people, charities and organisations. I have recently started my own fashion brand, but I have had to put this on hold due to the panademic. I am now in week five of my new job. I have also been making masks in my own time. For every mask that I sell, I donate one to an asylum seeker. Asylum Seekers donapost have a lot of money to live on from the Government and buying a mask is probably the last thing on their mind. The masks are colourful, some have sequins, some are plain and some are made from denim, I have also used fabric with printed superheroes on including Toy Story.

Jacob Gregory was having a picnic with his mum Sophie Hall, , and her partner Alex Conduit, , his daughter Bella, six, and their daughter Lily,  months, when the swan flew at him as he enjoyed a swim. The youngster was hauled from the water with blood streaming from his head after the attack by the huge bird which viciously pecked him. He was only saved when his brave mum ed fully-clothed into a river to rescue him. The Year  pupil at Bitham Brook Primary School in Westbury, Wilts, was taken to Frome Community Hospital with a deep wound in his head and is now recovering at home. Sophie Hall, of Oldfield Park, Westbury, said they chose a spot beside the River Wylye at picturesque Hanging Langford a few miles from their home. Jacob was playing in the river in his rubber ring along with a few other children in the water. Out of nowhere, a swan came charging towards him, and mounted him, flapping constantly, and attacked. Blood was pouring from his head. My partner and I ed into the water fully clothed to rescue my son and attempted to deter the swan from further attacking him. After dragging him from the water we were shocked to see he was covered in blood from a gash the swan had made on the back of his head. We took him to the minor injuries unit at Frome Community Hospital where he was treated and is now on medication for the wound. After the swan had been scared off by us, he then went up-stream and attacked another lady. My son was very shaken up but is very proud that he survived an animal attack and enjoys telling his story to people. At the hospital, nursing staff cleaned the wound but were reluctant to glue it closed because of fears that it might be contaminated with germs from the swan. Sophie said: They gave us a week’s supply of antibiotics and some special cream to put on it. The River Wylye between Hanging Langford and Steeple Langford is a popular picnic spot for families as there is parking opposite. Adults and children are able to swim and play in the river and afterwards sunbathe and dry off on the grassy river bank.

He said the closures had lead to less exercise as children were no longer walking to school, moving between classes, or playing sports with their friends which is how most young people burn energy. He said: We talk endlessly about the risks of transmission of Covid, and thataposs incredibly important, but itaposs not the only thing. The risk-balance equation for children is about the risks of not being in school and poor mental health, poor sleep and potentially lack of exercise and obesity. The Professor, who is a paediatrician and adolescent physician at University College Londonaposs Institute for Child Health, also said any exercise habits families had at the beginning of the lockdown may have faded as the restrictions have been eased and that finances may pay a part as unhealthy food is cheaper. According to NHS figures, more than a fth of Year  children aged ten and  are already aposclinically obeseapos.  However the impact of school closures on childhood obesity will not be known for a while because the National Child Measurement programme, which records weights in Reception and Year , has been suspended. Professor Jonathan Valabhji, NHS chief for diabetes and obesity, said the lockdown would only worsen the entire nationaposs battle with obesity. While Caroline Cerny of the Obesity Health Alliance, an umbrella group of more than  health organisations, said as there is evidence that child obesity increases during the six-week summer break there could be a similar effect during the lockdown.

Video footage showed a countdown apos--apos before the first customer in line walked through the doors of Fenwick in Newcastle. Customers can be seen wearing masks in the video while staff wear visors over their faces. Some have also opted for gloves. As the customers enter, keeping a distance between each other, the staff members break out into a round of applause for them. Shoppers use hand sanitiser from a dispenser right at the entrance of the store. It comes as many non-essential shops all around England have begun to open their doors today. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said it was the latest step in reopening Britainaposs economy. Department stores and high street shops are welcoming shoppers back for the first time in three months, and many have a new look with more spacious floor plans, limited numbers of customers and signage reminding people to stay two metres apart. Businesses have had to ensure they are Covid-secure according to Government guidelines, and many have been keen to stress the extra precautions they are taking, from deep cleaning stores to putting items that have been tried on or ed in quarantine. Masks are now mandatory on public transport but are not compulsory in shops, although customers queuing for the Apple store on Regent Street in central London were told they must wear face coverings once inside. Shoppers were told to use hand sanitiser as they walked into Primark in Oxford Street, and some customers wore gloves as they browsed the rails. Photographs outside reopened Primark stores around England showed huge queues of eager shoppers - one seen donning a full bodysuit of personal protective equipment. Dispensers have been stationed at the shopaposs entrance, where members of staff are observing customers as they enter. A queue of people also waited outside Nike Town on Oxford Street shortly after am, ahead of the storeaposs opening at am.

Rayshard Brooks died in hospital on Friday night after a scuffle with officers outside a Wendyaposs in Georgia, having allegedly failed a sobriety test and resisting arrest after falling asleep in his car. The -year-old was a father to three girls and also had a stepson, WSB-TV reports. Investigators tonight released footage of the struggle with Atlanta Police that preceded him being shot and killed, which comes only weeks after the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. It has sparked fresh demonstrations in the streets of Atlanta, which saw the Wendyaposs where Mr Brooks died lit on fire by protesters on Saturday night.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email  Images on local television showed the restaurant in flames while an anti-racist march has also completely shut down the Interstate  Highway. Mr Floydaposs death has sparked three weeks of widespread protests against racial discrimination, and in some cases violent clashes with police and right-wing counter-protesters, across the US and around the world.The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has now launched a probe into Mr Brooksapos death. In a statement given to CNN, it says police were called to the restaurant at around .pm on Friday after a man was found to be asleep in his vehicle, blocking the drive-through lane and forcing other customers to drive around him. The GBI says police then gave Mr Brooks a sobriety test, which he failed, leading to the scuffle.  Attorneys L. Chris Stewart and Justin Miller, who are now representing Mr Brooksapos family, released the images on Saturday night. According to broadcaster CBS, he had spent the evening of his death celebrating his eldest daughteraposs birthday. The fatal shooting led to Atlantaaposs police chief, Erika Shields, resigning on Saturday. Shieldsapos statement said: For more than two decades, I have served alongside some of the finest women and men in the Atlanta Police Department. Out of a deep and abiding love for this City and this department, I offered to step aside as police chief. APD has my full support, and Mayor Bottoms has my support on the future direction of this department. I have faith in the Mayor, and it is time for the city to move forward and build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. The Atlanta police involved in the shooting have been criticised for the use of firearms, given that Mr Brooks appears to have only had a Taser. The cityaposs mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, said: I do not believe that this was a justied use of deadly force and have called for the immediate termination of the officer. US politician Stacey Abrams, a former Georgia political candidate, is among those who have called for restrictions on police use of deadly force.Commenting on Twitter, she said: A Taser is not a deadly weapon. A gun is. Adrenaline and irritation are not the same as mortal fear. Running away should not be punishable by death. Public safety must mean the public is safe. All of us. And Jen Jordan, a Democratic State Senator for Georgiaaposs th District, wrote: Asleep in his car. Thataposs why police were called. Now he is dead after being shot three times in the back as he was running away. #RayshardBrooksshould not be dead. Authorities have not yet released the names of the two officers, who were both white. A video taken from a nearby car, and released by the GBI, shows Mr Brooks on the ground outside his car, struggling with two officers.

Before lockdown Jake went in search of the Crewe property after spotting it on Google Maps.Hidden behind an array of trees and overgrown bushes was the abandoned property - and it did not disappoint. He said: I never reveal the exact location of the places I find but this one was near Crewe. The sort of places I find are all old and abandoned so I never know what I am going to find. This house was as though someone just left and never came back. There was a pair of shoes and a sewing machine, and beds still in the house - plus an enormous Quality Street tin which was much bigger than the ones we get now!  The exterior of the property, albeit run-down, shows so much potential with its grand structure and columns surrounding the front door. Upon entering the property, the wallpaper in the hallway was peeling and the pretty geometric design of the floor was barely noticeable beneath the dirt.  Among the dirt and rubble were a number of books and magazines lying open - including a page from the Daily Star dated August ,  - as well as a sewing machine, a pair of menaposs smart shoes and a large tin of Quality Street. Upstairs, you can expect to see one of the bedrooms filled with broken furniture as well as branches pushing their way through the window. In the garden, other than the caravan, Jake spotted an array of car parts strewn around, and a mattress. This is a hobby for me, says Jake.

He was very charming and politely refused a member of staff who approached him for a picture. I was gobsmacked to see him.” Another witness added: “Moments after he left the restaurant clutching his dinner in a paper bag a member of staff jumped on the bench the Harry was sitting on and shouted: “I’m on the Prince’s throne!’ Nobody could believe what happened.”  However not everyone will be particularly impressed by what the royal ordered from the Nandoaposs menu. He ordered a pitta with extra cheese and a side of creamy mash, along with a double chicken wrap with chips. He also got a soft drink and bottle of water. However the pitta was lemon and herb, the chainaposs mildest offering which many people see as a terrible order. It’s unclear whether Harry – who wore a green polo shirt, denim jeans and a baseball cap partially disguising his face according to a witness - paid full price for the grub or took advantage of the  per cent discount the chicken-chain offers to military personnel.After picking up their order Harry, who was dating Cressida Bonas  at the time, and his pal casually exited through the car park which is connected with the building."},{"url":null,"title":"influencers dramatic weight loss before","story":"NewsInfluencers dramatic weight loss before dumping husband to have stepsons babyMarina Balmasheva lost a whopping eight stone before leaving her husband and getting pregnant by the stepson she had raised since he was seven years oldShareCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video influencerss-dramatic-weight-loss-before-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news influencers-dramatic-weight-loss-before-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

We knew we needed to improve his fitness.“Once we got him fit – we needed to get him up to scratch and keep him playing at the same time – and got into his head in terms of how we played, he was great for us.“He was brilliant at taking the ball, getting us up the park and running past defenders, his pace was a major asset.“I didn’t have a lot of hair at the time but I still lost a bit because he would drive you bananas at times with some of the silly things he’d do in good positions.“It goes without saying that he’s matured well beyond that now. He might have lost a bit of pace in recent years but he is a seasoned campaigner.“Back then he was desperate to come up to Scotland and play games.“The big thing we sold him on was the area, the lestyle – the tranquillity up here compared to the hurly-burly down south.“We told him he could get himself on the TV, sell himself in the big games and we were the type of club thatsomeone came in for you with a decent offer, you’d have the option to go.”Hayes – who started out at Reading – eventually left for Aberdeen in  after three years with Inverness.Over  games in five seasons and a League Cup winners’ medal in the Granite City followed before he clinched a £ million move to Celtic.The winger struggled to establish himself as a Hoops regular but he started several crucial games for the Scottish champions, including the  Scottish Cup final triumph over Hearts and the stunning Europa League victory over Lazio in Rome last November.Two months earlier he grabbed the second goal in the Old Firm derby as Neil Lennon’s side beat Rangers - at Ibrox.Hayes’ Parkhead exit – which has also led to interest from his former employers at Pittodrie – came less than two weeks after he picked up his third title medal in three campaigns with the club.Malpas said: “I thought Jonny would’ve got another contract at Celtic and that he would happily have stayed.“But maybe they’re trimming their squad a bit to get players in and maybe there wasn’t going to be the chance to play as many games next season.“He certainly didn’t let Celtic down when he was called upon.“For United, though, good on them for trying to sign Jonny. They’re clearly thinking about the right players and I think that’s the type of player they need.“He’s experienced and he’s played at a very good level. He’s still got pace, he can play in more than one position and he’s good in a dressing room.“I thinkyou were struggling in the middle of the pitch he could do a job there as well.“You’d never say he was the best defender, but he never seems to get a doing from the wide players he plays against.“Sometimes you think he isn’t the best at beating people yet he always seems to get crosses in.“For us at Inverness he was great at getting the ball in the box and created a lot of goals for guys like Adam Rooney.”The former United captain saw a transformation in Hayes during his time with the Dons.He added: “I’ve followed Jonny’s career for years and hoped he would do well.“He was great for us and did everything we asked. He’s one of the many guys you like to think you’ve helped a bit.“Jonny’s really matured and looked after his fitness. At Aberdeen he was playing under a bit more pressure in front of a more demanding crowd and that helped him make the move to Celtic.“He was a cheeky chappie when we had him –he got a bit of stick, he’d give a bit back. Some things used to affect him but I could see a dference at Aberdeen, he’d outgrown that and he could handle that.“We had a great group at Inverness. When we went in, we only kept three or four players and started again.“Graeme Shinnie was one of the kids that was there and he has developed into a right good player as well.“These guys would run through a wall for you and they were a joy to work with.“We didn’t have great facilities but these guys wanted to learn, they wanted to work and they had a great attitude.”Dundee United appoint senior club representative to liaise with Terrors fan groups\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-fan-groups-liaison embed # secretNdKFhlJe\" data-secret\"NdKFhlJe\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

encouraged to do the projectthey were able.#Although the children are currently learning from home, they are learning all about our environment and the seaside population.Inspired by the lighthouses, they began to find out what you can find at the seaside and how it has changed over the years, as well as researching sea creatures and how they can be affected by litter at the beach and in the sea. vw, px\"  They also took part in their own litter picks at the seasidethey were able to do so or near their homes, and wrote instructions for others to allow them to learn how to pick up litter safely.And they made marine monsters out of single use materials, the type you might find on a litter pick.Each of the pupils were then tasked with designing their own colourful lighthouses reflecting what they had learned over the project about the side, with one pupil#s design chosen.It will be transferred onto the D model, which will be used for the Lighthouse Trail next year.The children learned about how lighthouses are viewed as a beacon of hope, which linked in with Clan Cancer Support, which is often a beacon of hope for families affected by cancer.Working together, they took part in fundraising activities and raised £.Stephanie added: #To finish the topic, the children organised fundraising activities to raise money for CLAN.#Some did sponsored bike rides, others sold baking

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this. It has been good to share some of the memories of Argyll with you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSend us a photograph of your family member or friend enjoying their special day and we will publish it and wish them a happy birthday.Remember to include their full name, age, where they are from and a bit about what you did to make the day at home special.Send your photographs to editor@argyllshireadvertiser"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe featured image this week was submitted by Aileen Gillies of Lochgilphead, who caught this stunning sunset on May  at Bellanoch bridge on the Crinan Canal."},{"url":null,"title":"plans in place for 2021 camanachd cup final","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFollowing the expected cancellation of shinty’s  cup competitions, the Camanachd Association has confirmed with title sponsor Tulloch Homes and Kingussie Camanachd Club that the plan to host the final in Kingussie will be postponed for a year and will now take place on September  .The Tulloch Homes Camanachd Cup Final willto the Highland venue for the first time since  and for its th anniversary.First contested in , the final of shinty’s national knock-out cup competition promises to be a brilliant day out for all the family and a  chance to watch two of the country’s elite shinty teams.Hundreds of tickets have already been sold and to be part of this historic moment you can secure your tickets, including some exclusive offers, on shinty.The  final takes place at The Dell and will be one of the biggest stagings of the event in its -year history with live traditional music, entertainment and a dedicated Kids Zone adding to the festival feel.The first final of the Camanachd Cup took place at Inverness on April  .

This is a challenging operational environment for our aircrew and an extremely dficult period for our fundraising teams as the restrictions are preventing all the events, talks and activities taking place which are so essential to help support the country#s only charity-funded helicopter air ambulance service.It costs around £ million each year to fund our Perth and Aberdeen-based helicopter air ambulances.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

kayak, is part of the proposals revealed by the local authority with a series of images also unveiled.The proposed ClimatEvolution Zone would cover the under-construction town of Blindwells and surroundingcommunities stretching from Prestonpans to Longniddry and inland to Tranent and Macmerry.East Lothian Council is petitioning the Scottish Government to extend the National Development status given to the former Cockenzie Power Station site in its National Planning Frameworkdocument to a wider area in its planned revised framework which is under review.This could pave the way for the creation of the ClimatEvolution Zone which could transform the area over the next  years through innovative approaches to development.A public consultation on the vision has been launched by the council and breaks the plans down into dferent themes from environment to travel.It asks people to give their views on its approach to a wide range of issues including access and movement the water environment culture, heritage and leisure greenspace and bioersity strong communities and regeneration and enterprise.However, the vision has already come under fire from Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council which branded it ldquocomplex and unclear.The community council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it owns, after a series of public consultations in  but the report remains an informal ldquovisionary document.Now the former power station site could be merged into the new ClimatEvolution Zone with no reference to the original masterplan.Bryan Hickman, community council chairman, said: ldquoThe community council are very concerned by the documents recently published by the council.\"We understood that the changes required for NPF related to the former power station site.\"The y report now extends to Tranent, Prestonpans, Cockenzie and Port Seton, Longniddry and Blindwells as well as the power station site.\"Whilst some of the objectives are to be welcomed, the overall content is complex and unclear and includes such a large area as to be unmanageable in its detail.ldquoThe existing communities have been consulted on the power station site and the result was a masterplan commissioned by the council but not adopted by them.\"We have submitted this masterplan to be included in NPF.\"A number of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council also raised concerns about the consultation.Brian Weddell, chairman, questioned whether the proposed train station in the new plan would ever happen, saying: ldquoThere has been no meaningful consultation with local communities who all have concerns about the impact of this development on their communities.The new consultation is based around a study, drawn up in partnership with East Lothian Council, the Scottish Government, The Lothian Drainage Partnership, SEPA, Scottish Water and Scottish Natural Heritage.It considers how the council can take the opportunity of creating a new town at Blindwells and harness the latest technologies to reduce the arearsquos carbon footprint.Among the ideas up for discussion is using groundwater at Blindwells to create waterways and using natural geothermic energy to heat the outdoor water features.Douglas Proudfoot, project leader, said the idea behind the new water features was to avoid putting pipes underground to remove groundwater and utilise it instead as the new town of Blindwells develops on the former opencast coal site of the same name between Longniddry and Tranent.The first houses are due to be built later this year.He said: ldquoWe have a unique opportunity here with a blank canvas for a new town at a time when climate change is central to policies.\"I also think the Covid- pandemic has driven forward the idea that people can work from home and find alternative ways to work with the support of digital technology.Central to the vision is alternative ways to travel with an emphasis on walkways and cycle routes.A new train station at a central hub within an area the council has dubbed Greater Blindwells will provide additional access to public transport.To the north of the central hub between Cockenzie and Port Seton and Longniddry there are proposals for a water park or outdoor leisure area with the potential to create a lido with space for kayaking and other water sports.At the former Cockenzie Power Station site, less than half-a-mile away, a new centre of excellence is proposed described as a training school and ldquoexemplar developmentin modular manufacture and construction.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray welcomed the ambitious strategy.He said: ldquoThe Cockenzie and Blindwells sites are adjacent to one another and it has always been inevitable that their development will be closely linked, so it makes sense to seek to extend National Development status to Blindwells.ldquoThe whole area offers unique potential to transform these former industrial sites into places where people can live and work in a sustainable way.Kenny MacAskill, East Lothian MP, also welcomed the project which will lsquointeractrsquo with neighbouring communities.He said: ldquoThe area is a far wider community and cannot be seen in isolation.The inclusion of adjacent communities is therefore essential.Councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the proposals are not a lsquofinalised masterplanrsquo but rather a ldquohigh level document which sets out an ambitious vision for the area over the coming  years.He said: ldquoItrsquos an exciting opportunity to ensure that one of the key areas of East Lothian, is developed in an innovative way.\"Itrsquos not all about whatrsquos new, though.\"We are looking at enhancing the existing local environment and making the most of the arearsquos unique history as well as its mining and agricultural heritage and the site of the Battle of Prestonpans.The council launched its eightweek consultation on its online hub on Monday.The Scottish Government is revising its National Development Planning Framework which gives an overview of what it wants to see develop on key sites across Scotland.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoWe are grateful for the many views and ideas received in response to early engagement on National Planning Framework  .Our analysis of the responses is underway and will continue over the summer, and we expect to publish an update in the autumn.The council consultation can be found at

provided they are non-aerosol generating procedures.Mr Ferris however notes that ldquonot all dental practices will be able to open at the same time as some practices may take longer to prepare.He

School pupils, too, have been subject to major disruption and face an uncertain future as jobs and employment prospects disappear.Some workers and pupils, especially those without access to digital technology and skills, will be particularly hard hit and this is why CGI is keen to reach the most vulnerable to help them stay afloat in a post-Covid world.Through their community engagement programme, the company already has a focus on disadvantaged groups and this will continue and be strengthened further over the next year, according to CGIrsquos Director of Corporate Responsibility,Philippa Green.The company has almost , UK staffand she said they were keen to become involved and do what they could to help society recover.Before the pandemic hit, part of CGIrsquos community programme which focuses on supporting the next generation, was working in schools to interest pupils in careers in science, technology, engineering and maths.This work involved hosting STEM camps which engaged students across the UK in fun STEM related activities. The physical camps were cancelled when schools shut their doors but the organisation quickly pivoted and put a version online to help children, parents and schools through the lockdown.ldquoWe started doing it as an immediate response to the situation, said Green.ldquoLike many other people we thought it was going to be a short term project and children would be going back to school fairly quickly but it is now apparent that it is going to be longer than first expected so we are trying to pivot to the next stage.The content will remain online but unfortunately may not be of much use to pupils without a good digital connection or devices at home.Educationalists have already raised fears that this group of already disadvantaged children will suffer most because of the lockdown and CGI is keen to see how it can help reach them.ldquoMany children will not have been in school for six months which is a very long time. For youngsters thatrsquos a letime! said Green.CGI supports many organisations working with vulnerable and disadvantaged children and is working with them to reach those who do not have access to technology.The physical camps had often been targeted at the most vulnerable children in society and one of the companyrsquos last events in Glasgow was in a special educational needs school.One of the other aspects of the companyrsquos community programme is mentoring, when members go into an event in school to give older children career advice and an idea of what working le is like.ldquoTheir parents and their grandparents may not have worked and so the children may not have any idea about working le, said Green. ldquoEvents have been successful but we would normally do that in a school setting in a hall where our members can have one to one chats with pupils and that is obviously tricky to do at the moment.The company has started to record career mentoring videos to support some community groups.In the meantime there are still some new STEM from Home themes to come online before July and these will be released weekly until the end of June.Another group at the front of minds at CGI are those currently working through CGIrsquos graduate apprenticeships at Glasgow Caledonian and Edinburgh Napier Universities. ldquoWe are clear that these iniduals are key to the future of our business says Green.ldquoMark East and Maria Whittingham in our student recruitment team are working hard to ensure they have practical support whilst also thinking about the solutions for future student recruitment at this very important stage in their careers.Elsewhere, CGI, which supports The Glasgow Timesrsquo Streets Ahead initiative, continues to encourage its members to fundraise, with efforts being moved online. Members are asked to nominate regional charities for the companyrsquos charities fund whilst in recent weeks they have been at work fundraising for a foodbank to help those people hardest hit.Members also still have the opportunity to nominate local community sports teams for kit sponsorship.It is hoped this will come into its own as group physical exercise is increasingly encouraged and people get the chance to re-establish important bonds.RETRAINING WILL ENSURE NO-ONE IF LEFT BEHINDCGI has been in a better position than many companies to weather the pandemic lockdown and, as a result, is keen to help society recover post-Covid.ldquoIn February the world changed but some communities and industries are more impacted than others so it feels a bit remiss not to refocus our efforts for these areas in particular, said the companyrsquos Vice President Lindsay McGranaghan for Scotland.An important part of CGIrsquos work is its community programme and the company is now looking at how it can help communities and schools post-Covid.ldquoWe do a number of things around community benefit but we may have to rethink what we have been doing historically and tailor some of that to meet the impact of Covid, said McGranaghan.ldquoWe need to think about who is going to be most hard hit by the pandemic from an education perspective and whether we tailor our work to be more focused on the vulnerable children, as well as the industries impacted such as those where there have been quite heavy redundancies.Technology and technological skills have proved to be an immense boon during the pandemic lockdown and it is quickly becoming apparent that those who do not have access to technology, or know how to use it properly, are at a distinct disadvantage in the st century.McGranaghan feels that as a technology company, CGI is well placed to help both children and workers without these skills and could help retrain those in danger of being left behind.The company has already been working with the Wise Group in Glasgow to help retrain long term unemployed people in IT skills and is now wonderingthis could be extended to impacted industries and newly unemployed people.ldquoWe are looking at things like retraining opportunities, she said.ldquoWe have been reasonably resilient in the technology industry during Covid just because of the nature of the work we do and the question is whether we could put out a hand to dferent industries during what is going to be a dficult time ldquoWe want to look at how we can do this through our community programme.ldquoI think there is something there not only in terms of supporting the local authorities that we already work with, but also how we help with the recovery process.ldquoGiving back to the local community is very importantto us."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11477211.jpg?type=article-full","title":"coronavirus-edinburgh-family-one-first-bring-covid-scotland","story":"It comes after new genetic research revealed that the disease began circulating in Scotland during February and that it was brought here from continental Europe.Trish Lumsden, , tried to get her eight-year-old son, Christian, tested for the disease when he fell ill with a cough and fever on February , but was told by her GP that it was \"probably a cold\".By that time he had been back at school for nearly two weeks.UK-wide travel guidance on Italy was updated on February , by which time the country - which quickly became Europes Covid hotbed - had recorded hundreds of cases, a handful of deaths, and had quarantined  towns in Lombardy and Veneto.: Coronavirus spreading in Scotland in FebruaryAnyone who had arrived in the UK from northern Italy since February  was urged to self-isolatethey developed symptoms within  days, or to self-isolate as a precaution - regardless of symptoms -they had been in any of the areas by then under lockdown.Like hundreds of other Scottish holidaymakers who had travelled to Europe for the half-term break, the Lumsden family - who had been ski-ing in the Dolomites - ed to Scotland on February , making them exempt from this advice.But it is now thought the virus would have been widespread well before this date in Italyrsquos popular ski resorts and tourist centres such as Venice ndash which the Lumsdens visited hours before flying home.\"We didnt even realise until we go there that the Carnival was on and it was incredibly busy,\" said Mrs Lumsden.\"We couldnt even get into St Marks Square it was so busy.

Edinburgh City Council is to consider a plan to rededicate the statue to those who continued to suffer enslavement during this period.Across the world other statues have been targeted in the wake of international protests about the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis two weeks ago. In Bristol last Sunday, a statue of the th-century slave trader, Edward Colston, was felled by protesters and flung into the harbour.Devine insisted that focusing merely on statues and other artefacts from the past was misplaced. ldquoIf people want to talk about Scottish involvement in slavery they need to be aware of the full picture. In the th and early-th centuries the Scottish nation as a whole was lsquocomplicitrsquo in slavery. The markets and financial s from lsquothe nefarious businessrsquo helped to lay the foundation for modern Scotland and shaped the economy from which we now benefit.In , Devine edited a collection of essays about Scotlandrsquos historic involvement in the slave plantations. Recovering Scotlandrsquos Slavery Past demonstrated how all levels of Scottish society, from the early-th century to the end of slavery in the British Empire, were directly or indirectly affected.:Without slavery Glasgow wouldnt exist: The brutal truth about Scotlands slaving pastldquoThe new research showed that merely concentrating on prominent mercantile figures fails to take account of the fact that Scottish society as a whole benefited from chattel slavery: weavers of lsquoslave clothrsquo for the West Indies fishermen who exported dried fish to feed the slaves workers in the mills who processed the raw cotton harvested by slave labour the crews of the vessels who sailed across the Atlantic and the officials, lawyers and clergymen who administered the slave colonies and the spiritual needs of their owners.ldquoOnly by acknowledging the full extent of this nationrsquos role in slavery can we begin to construct a meaningful programme of response today to that dark period of history.lsquorsquoI am convinced that the evidence we now have suggests Scottish modernisation was even more dependent on the slavery factor than England. This was not because of involvement in the slave trade itself. Ships from Scottish ports rarely took part in that horrible commerce in human beings after . Rather it was based on the overwhelming place of tobacco, sugar and then cotton in Scottish external trade. The remarkable boom in these commodities depended entirely on armies of black slave labourers.In , Glasgow University published a report, based on more than two years of research, that revealed it benefited directly from the slave trade in Africa and the Caribbean in the th and th centuries. Its audit put the figure at pound million in todayrsquos money. Following this the university launched a wide-ranging ldquoreparative justice programme to include the creation of a centre for the study of slavery and to establish ties with the University of the West Indies.The study also raised questions about how the wealth of Glasgow and other parts of Scotland was accumulated. Devine praised the universityrsquos research and openness. ldquoThe research confirms that manmore Scots gained from the colonial trades based on slave labour than the tobacco lords and sugar princes who are now attracting such virulent media and political condemnation, he said.:Hundreds turn out lsquoto protectrsquo Glasgow war memorialldquoTherefore, it follows that today there must be institutions and families with links to those times and who prospered from the profits of chattel slavery. But so far, in Scotland, only the University of Glasgow has admitted how it benefited and how it intends to proceed by way of some form of recompense to the people of the West Indies. Why are others silent ldquoOne positive consequence of the current furore has been the triggering of a deeper awareness of the inequalities that black people in Britain and the US continue to encounter to this day and which have undeniable connections to slavery. ldquoYet in order to begin to heal that wound in Scotland, a soundly-based and open knowledge of the nationrsquos central part in slave history is an essential precondition."},{"url":null,"title":"shops-call-re-opening-date-announced","story":"The Scottish Retail Consortium wants a provisional reopening date so shops can prepare to open their doors to customers again.Non-essential shops have been shut since lockdown began on March  and many are facing a battle to survive the longer their doors remain closed.In England, clothes stores and bookshops are starting to open again from tomorrow but there is no date yet when this might happen in Scotland.Ewan MacDonald-Russell of the Scottish Retail Consortium said: ldquoWe really need an indicative timetable so we can put the right measures in place so wersquore ready to trade and customers can have a bit of confidence when they can come back to shops and get the products wersquore all hoping theyrsquoll want to buy.The Scottish Government has produced a route map out of lockdown with dferent measures occurring at dferent stages but no dates are attached to the phases.A spokesman said: ldquoWe have a review point on Thursday at which time we will consider further, safe progression through the route map.ldquoOur total package for businesses during this unprecedented economic crisis now exceeds pound. billion.

The Government is rudderless, drting making contradictory decisions or no decisions at all.Boris Johnson had nothing sensible to say about the Black Lives Matter demos which drove a coach and horses through the lockdown. He could either have endorsed the protests as legitimate on moral grounds, or called on the police to enforce the law. He did neither until forced to. Leadership was lacking.The belated introduction of a -day quarantine for travellers to Britain seems like a self-destructive exercise in closing the door after the viral horse has bolted.

The two-metre rule is causing massive problems as the economy tanks, yet the medical evidence for its effectiveness is contradictory.But the most serious accusation made last week against Boris Johnson was that he was asleep at the wheel in early March, and that his dilatory behaviour led to the deaths of tens of thousands of people.The claim was made by the former SAGE member, Professor Neil Ferguson .ldquoHad we introduced lockdown a week earlier, the Imperial College epidemiologist told MPs last week, ldquowersquod have reduced the final death toll by at least half.In other words,the UK Government had closed the schools and shops on March  instead of March , the official death toll might have been , instead of ,. This retrospectively validates Fergusonrsquos own forecast back in March that, on his model, lockdown should have kept the death toll to around ,.I think most now accept that the UK did just about everything wrong in its response to Covid-. We didnrsquot close the borders, didnrsquot protect care homes, abandoned testing and locked down too late. The question is: who is to blame for all this The editor of The Lancet, Richard Horton, in ldquoThe Covid Catastrophe which is to be published this week, names the guilty man: Boris Johnson. He failed to attend crucial meetings of COBRA, the Cabinet crisis committee, failed to listen to scientists, and thought the country should ldquotake it on the chin in order to protect the economy.But it was not just the PM who delayed lockdown by one week. This was also the policy of the Scottish Government.I happened to be in the Scottish parliament on March , the day that Leo Varadkar announced the closure of schools and universities in Ireland. At First Ministerrsquos Questions, Nicola Sturgeon explained why she was not following suit. She was, she insisted, ldquofollowing the science.School children sent home were likely to take the disease into their communities and to older people, ldquowhich might be a greater risk in terms of spread of infection than their being in school. She also said that parents would have to stay at home to look after them and this would denude staff for essential services like the NHS.:London Protests: More than  arrested as Boris Johnson condemns far-right protests as lsquoracist thuggeryrsquoIt all seemed sensible at the time. The national clinical director, Jason Leitch, was all over the media saying that the vast majority of us were going to get the virus anyway, because there was no vaccine, and that we had to ldquoprotect the vulnerable as it ldquoworked its way through the population.The release of SAGE minutes two weeks ago confirms that the scientic advisers were at best cool about lockdown. They may not have been in thrall to heartless herd immunity, but they did believe that trying to suppress the virus would be counterproductive.On March , the minutes say \"SAGE was unanimous that measures seeking to completely suppress the spread of Covid- will cause a second peak.It added that it was ldquoa near certainty that countries such as China, where heavy suppression is under way, will experience a second peak once measures are relaxed.The scientic consensus was that eradication of the disease was not possible because it would spread until herd immunity ndash % of the population ndash finally burned the virus out. But Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, took a dferent view. She closed the borders immediately cases appeared and kept them closed, and imposed a severe lockdown internally and suppressed the virus until it disappeared. Last week she declared victory over Covid .\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Coronavirus in numbers: UK death toll at ,\",\"description\": \"Coronavirus in numbers: UK death toll at ,\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media gHqFBAP poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests gHqFBAP.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Only time will tell whether SAGE was right. There may indeed be a second wave and New Zealand will have very little immunity to it. Borders cannot be kept closed forever. However, the minutes seem to confirm that, as Professor Lawrence Freedman argued in the New Statesman, ldquothe Government was largely following SAGErsquos advice.Some have claimed that Nicola Sturgeon wanted to follow dferent advice and was overruled by Westminster. That isnrsquot the case. The First Minister was following the same scientic advice as Westminster, and made clear she did not believe lockdown was yet necessary or desirable on March .Itrsquos hard to believe that a weekrsquos delay could have led to , deaths, as many as on the first day of the Battle of the Somme. Scientists will debate this for years.Indeed, analysts in Bristol, led by the mathematical modeller Professor Simon Wood, now claim now that the disease peaked before lockdown was introduced, suggesting that SAGE was right.SAGE had always argued, as the minutes show, that the best way to contain the spread was hand washing, social distancing, and protecting the old and vulnerable. The UK Government was only persuaded of lockdown by Neil Fergusonrsquos infamous forecast, on March , that without it , would die.The one thing we have learned from coronavirus is that science is not a monolith and that scientists disagree as much as politicians. All of which makes little dference to the state of the PMrsquos popularity, which dropped dramatically during Cummingsgate and has not recovered.Tory commentators are whispering that Johnson has lost it, doesnrsquot look well.

For an intelligent man, he is remarkably inarticulate. He ldquoums and ldquoahs his way through Prime Ministerrsquos Questions ashe is making it up as he goes along. The suspicion is that he is, and that he relied too much on Dominic Cummings to do the thinking for him.Before he became Prime Minister, Johnson had a reputation for being lazy and shallow.

regardless of anxiety about the virus, but the homeschooling portion of the curriculum will not be legally enforced.He told the BBCs Sunday Politics Scotland: \"I dont want it to go on for a minute

doing everything we can right now to avoid having a second wave of this virus come the autumn [and] winter, but none of us can rule that out right now.\"The First Minister signalled more money could be made available to councils to help schools cope with social distancing measures.She said: \"Local authorities are making plans and putting plans in place for the blended model of learning we will

of the cohorts, and was willing to enter talks with councils on funding needs.He said: \"What Ive said to local authorities is come forward with those proposals and well look at those

Big name retailers moved in and, as time wore on, the ldquoto let signs began to appear.Now, however, that same community spirit that raised pound.s d from local people to pay for their th century fountain is helping to revive Dumfries High Street, in a project that, it is hoped, will provide inspiration forother towns up and down the country.Rather than wait for someone  to step in to breathe new le into the empty shops and buildings, local people are pushing ahead with plans to take back control of their neglected high street.Work is expected to start within weeks on the first High Street building to be reclaimed from lying empty.While its Victorian frontage with all its unique character will remain in place, a pound. million redevelopment will see the former Bakerrsquos Oven shop reborn as seven new affordable rent flats, with space for start-up businesses, art exhibitions and socialand community enterprise projects.Named ldquoThe Oven, it is one of eight retail units included in community-run Midsteeple Quarterrsquos innovative plans to rejuvenate the heart of the town as a place to live, visit, shop, dine and be entertained.The innovative project is being eyed up by towns and organisations across theUK, anxious to seeits community buy-out model might be a viable option to help transform other places hit by a sht towards internet shopping and out of town retail parks.ldquoFor a long time the town centre was bookies, charity shops and empty units. Dumfries has just said lsquoenough is enoughrsquo, says Evie Copland, chairwoman of the community benefit society, Dumfries High Street Ltd, which is behind the Midsteeple Quarter project.ldquoPeople had been buying buildings in the High Street for too long and not givingus something we could be proud of.ldquoAs people began to use their collective voices, we have been able to get a special development off the ground.ldquoThe Oven is the flagship, and a blueprint to showwhat the people of Dumfries can do.The plans have been brewing since  when the townrsquos artist-led development trust, The Stove Network, carried out research to find out what the future of High Street might be and to ask local people what they wanted.ldquoThere were a number of issues, says Scott Mackay, manager of The Midsteeple Quarter.ldquoOne was ownership of High Street buildings. We discovereda lot are owned by absentee landlords who lived where, people notwith a vested interest in the town.ldquoFunds and investment companies had been buying up the buildings and renting out ground floors to national retail chains. Sometimes these buildings have two more floors, but they just lie empty.ldquoIt is the same at high streets up and down the country ndash every one had the same shops and streets had lost their local character.ldquoAs high streets contracted, there was out of town retail and internet shopping, so a lot of shop units were lying empty and the values of buildings dropped.With buildings which once carried a poundm price tag now valued at around half that, and vacant units with sky-high rents but no sign of new occupants, hopes grew that the townspeople could use community buy-out legislation to help them take over empty properties.Inspired by rural land community buy-outs in places such as Eigg, Assynt and Gigha, and driven by the townrsquos creative and artistic community, the Dumfries plan was designed to be Scotlandrsquos first ldquourban buy-out.Within weeks of its launch and a mock high street protest aimed at highlighting empty shops, the community benefit company had attracted hundreds ofpound shareholders eager tohave their say in forging a new-look town centre.Their plans were boosted two years ago, when Dumfries  Galloway Council agreed to hand over the former Bakersrsquo Oven building in an asset transfer deal that cost the group just pound.Itrsquos meant the group has not yet had to draw on community ownership legislation, while funds for The Ovenrsquos redevelopment have come from a iety of sources including the Regeneration Capital Grant Fund which is delivered in partnership between the Scottish Government and COSLA, and South Scotland Enterprise Fund.Planning approval forThe Oven is expected next month. Demolition work to the rear will begin later this year, with hopes it will be finished within  months.The organisation is also in the process of raising funds to buy two other units and has approached the owners of two others.Mr Mackay said the intention is to create a vibrant blend of retail, affordable housing, exhibition and arts space, with entertainment and food and drink outlets helping to transform the area into a bustling hub.ldquoAn obstacle for high streets for a long time has been a lsquoretail onlyrsquo or lsquoretail firstrsquo planning requirement, he added. ldquoIt meant that by pm everything in the High Street would be dead.

Everyone has questions to answer, but Westminster is, by far, the most culpable.G R Weir, Ochiltree.THE ldquoevidence Peter Russell assembles for his claim that the Covid- ldquobuck stops with the Scottish Government has more holes than a piece of Emmental cheese.Showing ldquohow and when the Scottish Government was overruled on the issues of lockdown and quarantine may be interesting, but the fact is that their powers are not adequate to accomplish most of what Mr Russell condemns them for not doing.Mr Russell forgets how Lord McConnell, while still First Minister, was slapped down by the Home Office for suggesting that post-graduate students be allowed to remain for a couple of years after their course had completed. Immigration is reserved to Westminster, so the First Minister had no powers to close Scotlandrsquos borders and any suggestion or implication to the contrary is misleading.As far as the lockdown is concerned,put in place before Westminsterrsquos decision, does Mr Russell not consider it probable to the point of near certainty that, their powers over public health notwithstanding, national chains of shops would have gone to court to test the power of the First Minister to close their Scottish branches as excessive, particularly when Westminster had not done the same Moreover, lockdown would mean many employees having no income, but being non-sovereign, and unlike Rishi Sunak, unable to drop a line to Andrew Barclay at the Bank of England asking him to print more money to support the furlough scheme that has put in place a floor for the economy, where was the First Minister to secure the resources to do this  This is why the Nicola Sturgeon and theFirst Minister of Wales have written to the Chancellor asking that the furlough scheme be extended to suit the pace at which the dferent nations leave lockdown.Despite Mr Russellrsquos imaginative demands to see evidence of the Scottish Government taking its own alternative position, none of this challenges Bismarckrsquos view that ldquopolitics is the art of the possible and that what was possible was very much in the gt of the Westminster Government. Yes, public health is devolved, but the above are not. As the UK Government has learned in its approach to the EU, cherry-picking is not possible.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.STRUAN Stevensonrsquos claim that the coronavirus has claimed two-thirds of the lives that are lost on British roads every yearcannot go unchallenged. As soon as I read those words I thought, that cannot be right, so I decided to do some research.The most up to date figures I was able to find were from . The website for Brake, the road safety charity claims that , people were killed on British roads in . The UK Governmentrsquos own website states that the figure was , and gives a provisional estimate for the year ending June  of ,.We can all make mistakes of course, but to quote figures so wildly far off the mark is irresponsible.David Clark, Tarbolton.I AM a -year-old retired doctor with ongoing cancer, living in the Scottish Borders. I wrote to my MP, John Lamont, on March , nine days before lockdown, strongly supporting the open letter  British scientists had sent that day urging immediate lockdown. I asked my MP to urge the Government to implement immediate social distancing measures. He replied on March : ldquoI strongly believe the British Government is correct to follow what our own advisors tell us. I was so troubled I emailed him on March  and again on March  emphasising the fact that every day of delay was allowing more viral spread, meaning overwhelmed NHS doctors and nurses would soon be making agonising treatment decisions.Mr Lamont believes that local voices should be heard \"at the highest levels\" and is diligent with correspondence. I have asked him repeatedly whether he acted on my March emails. Unfortunately, he declines to answer that question, instead replying tersely on June : ldquoI point out again, the decision on when and how to impose lockdown restrictions here in Scotland is the responsibility of the Scottish Government. Do you dispute that Irsquove been shaken by such a reply from my elected representative. It leaves me feeling more vulnerable and totally unrepresented by the MP who, in mid-March, I asked three times to forward on to Westminster my urgent and relevant health concerns regarding all UK citizens.Earlier action by Boris Johnson in March would have made such a dference. On March  both Denmark and UK had a similar number of recorded cases of coronavirus,  and  cases respectively. On March  Denmark locked down. UK allowed business to continue as usual and inexplicably stopped all virus testing in the community on March  despite WHO advice to \"Test. Test. Test.\" Denmark is now out of lockdown with a Covid death rate of  per million population. UK has an exhausted care system, a death rate of  per million, and worryingly high rates of new infection as we struggle to emerge from lockdown. It is a tragedy that could have been avoidedMr Johnson had listened to all scientic advice in March.Dr Mary Gillies, Selkirk.ANDY Maciverwrites that we should have some empathy with our senior politicians as they have to make very dficult decisions at this time.Indeed they do have very dficult choices and one of the easiest for Mr Johnson to make was to sack Dominic Cummings for taking us all as fools for driving to Barnard Castle to check his eyesight. Maybe he needed them checked to read his marriage certicate. Oh yes, it was that date.Funny how the Government and Mr Johnsonrsquos popularity has plummeted since making that choice.Sorry Mr Maciver, any sympathy I had for Mr Johnson has disappeared. He is not a leader, he continues to wing his policies.Willie Towers, Alford.ANDY Maciver urges us to give our leaders our support, as human beings in the same boat as we all are, but with much greater responsibilities than most of us, instead of heaping opprobrium on them.Hes got a good foundation for this attitude. Theres a biblical mandate for all of us ndash believers of whatever persuasion and none ndash o honour those in authority and to pray for them. .Were responsible for having put these men and women in a position of authority over us by our votes. We need to continue our duty by supporting them and doing so, as Mr Maciver writes, not by agreeing with everything they say or do but by recognising the responsibility that lies on their shoulders.David Kennedy, Glasgow G.Read more: Letters: It should be clear that the buck rests with the Scottish Government"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-british-state-pay-reparations","story":"After Bannockburn, nothing changed in the misery ordinary folk suffered at the hands of the barons, with their right to \"pit and gallows\". But, whatever truth Johnston lays bare about Bruce ndash dferent from the story book tale ndash the consequence of his self-interest was to stamp forever on our national le, the idea of Scotland independent from England. Wrecking his statue and memorial doesnrsquot alter history one jot, or erase him from it as one of the most important figures in our nationrsquos narrative. Let the man be.Where does the logic of the demolition crew stop  It cannot be at tearing down mere blocks of stone, which can speak,they do, only from one spot. Of far greater importance are written works still in wide circulation: books, plays and poems. If statutes are to fall, why are written works, with offensive content ignored, and not ceremoniously burned in great piles  Are Shakespeare, Dickens, Kipling, Burns, and many more, all to be eliminated  If not, why not  It is impossible to hump statues around, but not books, or plays. The only dference in principle between statues and books, is that the latter are far more widespread and thus more influential on human thought and action.There is a far better way for the Black Lives Matter movement to create the change needed. Demand reparations from the British state, which includes Scotland, for the evil done by the slave trade. Slavery was abolished by a combination of moral pressure and money. The slave owners received compensation for loss of \"property\" at todayrsquos equivalent of pound billion. The slaves got nothing.Adequate reparations is more than a gesture to correct a historical wrong. A large reparations fund should be run by the minorities whose ancestors were exploited. They, better than anyone , know what needs to be done to build their institutional and societal strengths, and so help create a country where respect and equality are the birth right of everyone. It is surely more productive to pursue reparations that can have a long term practical, beneficial effect for people of colour, than toppling Henry Dundas.Jim Sillars, Edinburgh EH.EVER the opportunist, Nicola Sturgeon says her Government will lead the debate about street names and statues in Scotland. She is an extremely intelligent woman brought up in the west of Scotland, who, like me and many others, will have always been aware that hugely financially successful Glasgow merchants, like those in Bristol and Liverpool, not only traded in cotton, sugar and tobacco but also slaves. It would be cynical of me to suggest that raising the subject now may be because she sees a few more votes from that cause.However,she is now to become a paragon of virtue about things in the past, how about removing statues and tributes to Robert the Bruce who gained the Scottish crown by cold-blooded murder  Pigs might fly.Duncan Sooman, Milngavie."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Marianne Taylor  George Square needs to be completely overhauled - here   s why","story":"The new station completely transforms the look and feel of this part of town.

Unsurprisingly, as time passes so businesses from across the region are increasingly seeking clarity on a wide range of issues vital to their survival.With Phase  of the unlocking process due shortly, the FSB believes that this is the perfect time for smaller businesses to question Mr Ewing on what the Scottish Government is doing to support businesses over the next year.The FSB’s Highlands  Islands Area Leader and director of the Kylesku Hotel, Tanja Lister, said: “We know how anxious businesses are becoming about their abilities to survive in this new world and, given that the virus is unpredictable, they clearly want as much clarity as possible so that they can plan their survival strategies once unlocking takes place.“In particular, they want to know when and how unlocking will take place, what they must do to comply with distancing protocols, how local communities will be persuaded that the time is right to unlock, and the nature of the Government-backed business support that will be put in place to carry the regional economy though to next Easter and beyond.“Nobody should think that businesses can go from nought to  in a few days – it will take a long time for them to recover, and many will need ongoing support from governments, public agencies, other businesses and, very importantly, the general public, for many months to come.“We know how heavily engaged Mr Ewing is in his vital role and we are delighted that he is giving up his time to take questions on Monday. This is the perfect time for him to meet Highlands  Islands businesses and we are looking forward to a very productive hour with him.”Questions must be submitted in advance and we will ask as many as we can in the allotted time, say the organisers. Participants can also submit comments during the meeting using Zoom’s ‘Chat’ .The event is free and open to all businesses.

Hundreds were accused after the Horizon system showed cash shortfalls at their branches.Speaking in the House, Mr Carmichael said: “I hope that when he s to the department today he will tell his officials and tell also the Post Office senior management that this review just isn’t going to cut it.#This is a complex case and that is why it requires a judge-led inquiry, and that is what will happen eventually, so why not just cut to the quick and do it now ”Responding for the Government, Paul Scully MP said: “The point is the terms of reference within this review are the same as a judge-led inquiry.#I do not want an inquiry that lasts  years and that sub-postmasters are going to come back time and time again with no justice. This is something that I have been pushing on from the moment that I found out the detail about it, and that is why I am going to drive this through to make sure that the answers are heard and that independent chair gets to the bottom of this and gets some answers.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The minister’s response was inadequate. Postmasters are vital parts of our communities, especially in the outer isles where they sit at the heart of island le. This scandal and the Post Office’s woeful reaction to it have undermined confidence in the treatment of our postmasters. The government must do more to repair that trust, starting with a proper judicial inquiry.“It bears repeating that local post offices have proven their essential role once again during the Covid- crisis. We have to ensure that future postmasters are not put off by this scandal.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The two metre social distancing rule will affect passenger capacity for our ferries – and we also continue to experience issues around the availability of staff and the effect that has on opportunities around timetabling.“I would assure our isles residents that we continue to bring these issues and challenges to the attention of the Scottish Government and will do all we can to maximise sailingsnecessary, taking on board the views of our isles residents throughout.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

Many protesters’ actions, in clear breach of social distancing rules, were dangerous.Yet nobody should shed tears when the bronze statue of a brutal th century Bristol slaver is hauled from his distinguished plinth in the city centre and thrown into the harbour.Our main concern should be how and why it was allowed to stay there for so long.As Edward Colston#s effigy toppled towards the watery grave to which he had consigned so many enslaved Africans, a protestor knelt on Colston#s neck.That was a graphic illustration of the incident which precipitated the storm: the throttling by a Minneapolis police officer of the US citizen George Floyd.George Floyd#s last words were #I can#t breathe#, which applied both literally and to his place in society.There is nothing sacrosanct about most secular statues. Before  statues of Adolf Hitler were commonplace in Europe.You would be hard pressed to find one now.The same applies to Josef Stalin in most of the former Soviet territories.Just outside New Delhi there is a lonely and extensive graveyard of hundreds of statues of former eminences of the British colonial Raj. Wild dogs roam among them.Closer to home, Glasgow#s and Edinburgh#s exploitation of slavery is being recognised by the alteration of Glasgow street names and a plaque in Edinburgh#s St Andrew#s Square by the -foot statue of Henry Dundas, which will detail his connections with the slave trade.It#s either that or throw him in the Forth.We were no innocents in this field. In , no fewer than  per cent of Jamaican slave plantations were owned by Scots.Research by University College London has revealed that when slavery in British territory was abolished in , the equivalent of £ billon in compensation was handed out to just over  Scottish proprietors.They were not all in Glasgow and Edinburgh.Donald Martin of Monkstadt in Skye cashed in on his ill-gotten gains. So did Alexander MacLean of North Uist.The Raasay proprietor George Rainy banked his share from human traffic, as did Donald MacLeod of Lewis and Alexander McBarnet of Attadale.There are no statues of those gentlemen to throw in the sea.But the next time somebody suggests a similar fate for the statue of the Duke of Sutherland on Ben Bhraggie # a fate to which we would have little objection # we should remember that black lives also matter.They did then and they do now.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/HWRC__Portree_Re_Opening_15th_June_graphic-scaled.jpg","title":"portree recycling centre to re open on","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoineand receive confirmation before travelling to the site.The Portree site is open for essential waste disposal only, and householders are advised that journeys to a HWRC must only be undertakentheir waste cannot be stored at home safely.

Orwe the providers are the birds, desperately hoping for an income, fat and seed to feed us after an extra-long winter.Social media fluttered with posts from businesses stating ‘we hope to be open’, the sensible ones being aware of Fergus Ewing’s proviso: “This date cannot be definitive and is conditional on public health advice and progression to phase three of the route map.”While a lot of work will need to be done, practicalities and protocols worked out, how do we clean rooms, how do we ‘meet and greet’, do we leave rooms fallow for  hours, do we use PPE when cleaning, I think as much work needs to be done in the wider community.How are the visitors going to eat, how are they going to shop I have seen some quite lax adherence to protection in local shops with face covering usage fairly minimal at best.We have probably got away with this behaviour due to the low numbers of cases outwith the care home community.This could change with an influx of people from away. Any vigilantism must be directed at ourselves and the messages we put out when we go about our day to day business as lockdown eases.Protect ourselves and others.Those vulnerable people we have been looking after with prescription runs and message collections, some of them might not be looking forward to an influx of staycationers.What  are they bringing with their much-needed cash None of these problems are insurmountable. Guidelines will be available and in the month ahead, confidence will hopefullyand a dose of common sense will go a long way to making things work.The talk is that furlough is just the precursor to redundancy, and the economy will be struggling in all sectors.The knock on is likely to be fewer visitors with less money, and of course with the quarantine enforcement for overseas visitors, there won’t be many coming from afar.I hope the tourismwill be a trickle, then a stream, in order for us all to get used to how it can work.Despite being involved in the business I actually hope that it never s to the flood, the tsunami of the last two years, where the danger was the destruction of our environment and our community.We were perhaps too busy making money to spend time with our families, friends and neighbours.While loving the quiet roads, the time spent with family, and the time spent re-evaluating prioritiesit couldn’t last for ever.The savings are being eaten into, the government assistance also doesn’t last forever, reality looms.There is an economic model of price and product determination, that everybody is acutely aware of called “supply and demand’.In recent years as the visitor numbers went through the roof, and perhaps became unsustainable, bed provision rose, spare rooms developed, cabins and pods built, garages renovated.Still numbers rose, and so did the prices, a simple correlation.There is likely to now be an oversupply of bed provision, the economists would foresee a reduction in price as people compete for a smaller market.This may at first bring prices down to a realistic level, there was perhaps a danger that Skye was becoming a rich person’s destination.A possible consequence may be what I have heard described as “a race to the bottom”, with what is effectively a price war, and possibly falling too far.This when the product suddenly has become more expensive to manage, rooms costing more to clean, hotels only being able to cope with fewer guests to comply with social distancing.We have a free market economy, there is little or no control, people can charge what they like, and undercutting is a valid entrepreneurial technique do something better cheaper#!I mentioned weeks ago, for many, the tourist dollar is the icing on the pension cake, a second income to a professional wage.Perhaps there is a fine line between need and greed.Some tourist operators have been forced to use food banks and needing help from the Skye Community Response group during lockdown.As business s, and these people can begin rebuilding their livelihoods, perhaps others have to decide what their own needs are.The pension or the wage might be enough.One of the reasons I love starlings is the incredible murmurations they create in autumn, just before roosting in the evenings.These bickering birds who flutter and jostle around the trees, for twenty minutes or so before descending to reeds and branch to sleep, put on a display with no equal in nature.Moving in unison, they create patterns in the sky, shapes, forms, dance. Apparently, each bird affects the six or seven around it but a flock of tens of thousands moves asone, producing something beautul.Community can be like that.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KC-Photo.jpg","title":"delight as kyleakin connections project to take ownership of its","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe project has been successful with its application to the Scottish Land Fund and has been awarded £, to buy the Old School in Kyleakin.Kyleakin Connections, a charity formerly known as Skye and Lochalsh Association for Disability, has been using the building for nearly  years as a day resource for adults with learning disabilities.This funding will allow Kyleakin Connections to buy the premises from Highland Council.The present services will continue to be delivered from the premises, including a range of activities which focus on increasing the independent living skills of the attenders, encouraging health and wellbeing and interacting with the wider community.The Nice Café and Bookshop, operated by the attenders one day per week, has proved to be a popular enterprise.The Old School is currently also being used by a number of local groups as a complement to the larger community hall.The purchase of the building will open up other possibilities and plans are in progress to expand and develop the facilities to meet the present and future needs of groups, especially the more vulnerable, within South Skye and Lochalsh.Dr Audrey Sinclair, Chairperson of Kyleakin Connections Board said: “We are delighted with the news.#Not only will it allow us to carry on our normal services, we shall be able to expand our activities and extend the usage of the building to other groups in the community.#Kyleakin Connections has been fortunate for many years to have a loyal group of members and friends and we are grateful for their support and encouragement with this project.#I would also like to acknowledge the Highland Council, the present owners of the Old School, for their positive response to our request to purchase the premises.#At a time of so much uncertainty and sad news during this Covid- crisis, it is refreshing to be able to bring some good news into the community and give everyone something to look forward to.#We are especially looking forward to when we can hold an event to celebrate the acquisition of the premises.”Local Councillor John Finlayson said: “I am delighted to have been involved in the discussions about the purchase of the building and I also welcome the positive relationships that have been further established between the Highland Council and the Board of Kyleakin Connections, to further develop the exciting future of this important and community-based group who deliver such a key service.#As someone who lives in the village of Kyleakin, I know how important Kyleakin Connections is to both the users and the local community.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3168596.jpg--.jpg?1591792177000\n","title":"low emission funds welcomed by wrightbus","story":"Following this mornings announcement by Northern Irelands Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon pledging poundm for low emission buses, Ballymena-based bus manufacturer Wrightbus has said it is delighted with the commitment to invest in a green recovery.

Four sites were explored throughout Ballymena with the Ballymoney Road location judged to be the most suitable to accommodate traders and customers.Alderman Audrey Wales MBE proposed the recommendations and it was seconded by Councillor William McCaughey.Alderman Wales, said: “This is a new beginning for Ballymena’s Saturday Market.“It signals a new future and a move that will ensure the future sustainability of the market within the context of promoting the town centre and its economic recovery plan.“As restrictions begin to lt we will start to see peopleto the town centres and we want to do everything in order to support our traders in this new normal.“Council recognises the importance of the Saturday market and this new location will allow accessibility for more traders and customers.“The aim is to benefit visitors, shoppers, and traders and ultimately help breathe new le into Ballymena Saturday Market.”It was decided that the location, close to the town centre, which is one of the main arterial routes into Ballymena would attract more people and it is also within close proximity to the bus and railway stations.The date of the move for the market from the Seven Towers Leisure Centre to the Ballymoney Road Car Park will be announced in due course.

The film follows a group of four young misfits as they set out to find the treasure of a long-lost pirate on their last weekend living in their under-threat neighbourhood.A noisy, high-energy and light-hearted watch, it was the perfect feelgood film for a sunny Sunday evening amid the current doom and gloom of the world.Among the spectators were die-hard fans of the movie, Nicky Kells and Michelle Currie. and Michelle Currie from Ballynure\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   and Michelle Currie from Ballynure\"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose and Michelle Currie from Ballynure\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news f .ece AUTOCROP w --_new__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   and Michelle Currie from Ballynure\"Nicky Kellsand Michelle Currie from Ballynure FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNicky Kellsand Michelle Currie from BallynureThe couple, who travelled from Ballynure for the occasion, say they were glad of the excuse to leave the house and have some sense of normality for the evening.We love The Goonies, it#s one of my favourite movies. To see it on a big screen will be great, said Nicky . It#s really strange that we haven#t been able to get to the cinema in so long. So, it is nice to just get out to do something dferent is a novelty now.Waiting patiently for the film to get under way, the Co Antrim pair praised the smooth running of the event, which was organised by local firms Red Box Media Productions and MayWe, a Belfast-based event management company.Cars were positioned two metres apart in line with social distancing guidelines and the field was lined with portable toilets for convenience, each one monitored by stewards and cleaned after every use.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseReporter Jenna Gardiner FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappReporter Jenna GardinerEven as soon as we pulled in we were impressed, it#s been very well organised, Nicky said. I couldn#t believe how clean the toilets were, especially for an outdoor event.The view is cracker with the screen positioned just in front of the Harland  Wolff cranes, added Michelle . The setting is just lovely.The couple say they are keen toto the drive-in cinema should it continue when the rest of normal le resumes.Compared with those distant memories of my pre-Covid cinema trips, watching from the car was a convenient experience.While drive-in cinemas are a relatively new attraction to Northern Ireland, borne out of the pandemic, I was struck by how nostalgic an experience it was to join hundreds of others to spectate from the car.Perhaps that#s down to the fact I#ve only ever seen it done in Grease, or due to the now-dated special effects of the film, but the whole ritual certainly felt like a blast from the past.One new novelty of the experience was the lack of distractions, with no coughing or sneezing, people using their phones or pesky whispers to contend with.Accessed by radio, we controlled the sound and volume ourselves and could recline our seats as far as we liked.Another plus for the spectators is that by attending the screening they were also helping in the fight against coronavirus, with all profits going towards vital research at Queen#s University Belfast.Without any indication of adate for conventional cinemas in Northern Ireland, the drive-in event offers a new prospect for movie buffs across the country.Around , cars attended throughout the day for four dferent classic movies, including The Lion King, Frozen  and Back To The Future, with an additional three films shown on Saturday.Certainly a fun way to spend an afternoon, the event kicked off with an interactive quiz to test our knowledge of The Goonies before the film started. Afterwards, it ended with a round of applause - or rather, a honking of horns - as the credits rolled on the Steven Spielberg classic.

The principals also asked all grammar schools to suspend the tests. Sinn Fein education spokesperson Karen Mullan welcomed the intervention.She said: A growing number of grammar schools across the north have already shown leadership and announced they are suspending the use of academic selection tests this year as a result of the Covid- pandemic.I would call on the remaining grammar schools which are still intent on using these unfair, unnecessary and unregulated tests to heed this call and abandon the use of academic selection this year and for good.Unofficial transfer tests have been used since the abolition of the -plus in  and are run by private test providers Association for Quality Educationand the Post-Primary Transfer Consortium .So far,  Catholic grammar schools and the integrated school Lagan College have confirmed they will not use the test results to admit pupils in .The Catholic Principals# Association, which wants a complete end to academic selection, is also calling for the tests to be cancelled in future years due to the impact of the coronavirus. Its chairman Kieran O#Neill said: The grammar schools that have already made the decision to suspend the use for this year have led the way.And whilst that is to be commended, there are still a number of Catholic grammars and indeed other grammars across the province, that haven#t done so.Mr O#Neill added: The current Year  children have just had something like four months out of school. Next year, following the formula suggested by Education Minister Peter Weir, they may have two days in school and two days off school and, depending how long this continues, they will receive % of their education for their whole P year.Belfast Most ReadNorthern Ireland town hall funded by slave trader #should be renamed#No regrets: Martina Purdy moves from sister to saint as ex-reporter who trained as nun takes on new roleCoronavirus: Date for NI hairdressers and gyms to reopen could be earlier than July  Belfast barbers# customers could end up half cut in garage salon serving boutique beerTributes to motocross fan Brendan Graham, discovered dead at Desertmartin track,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was also a very family-oriented business. Everybody knew each other and everybody was there for each other. People had worked there for  years or more and they loved serving the people of Northern Ireland, he says.Since lockdown, Nigel has been doing DIY projects using his engineering skills, and has been looking for work.I#ll probably go back to engineering, there#s more likelihood of me getting an engineer#s job in Northern Ireland, he adds.He says the highlight of his career was when he flew his family on a scheduled flight to London City Airport for his we#s grandmother#s th birthday, fulfilling her letime ambition of visiting the Cha Flower Show.He also loved sharing his knowledge as an engineer with first officers working alongside him in the cockpit.To me it was just the sheer fact that I never went to sleep at night dreading that I had to go to work the next morning.The worst aspect was always the threat of redundancy. Aviation is always the first industry that reacts quickly to a downturn and an upturn. Because of the cost in aviation you have to act very quickly and those who react the quickest are the ones who survive.It#s hard after  years to write up my CV, look at all the experience in my background and think where this leads to outside aviation.Nigel believes that Flybe employees lost their jobs as a result of Covid- because Virgin Atlantic, which had bought over the business, decided to focus on its own brand.Flybe was connecting people, families, businesses within the British Isles and that has now been lost, he adds.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePhilip Land with his late father Paul FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPhilip Land with his late father Paul‘I would cut my arm off to get a job in the industry again... it was an amazing experience but things will be dferent’Philip Land , from Lisburn, was a flight attendant for Flybe until the airline went into administration just before lockdown. He is married to Karl. Following a career in hospitality, Philip was working at a catering company in Belfast City Airport when he was encouraged to apply for a cabin crew position by crew stopping for lunch.“I’d always wanted to be a cabin crew, but because of my age and height, I didn’t think I would be suitable,” he says.“But I went to the assessment day and passed — that was three years ago and I was a cabin crew member from March that year. It’s been the most brilliant time.”Philip describes Flybe’s employees as being like a family. “My best day was the first day I flew on what is called ‘fam day’, short for familiarisation, when I had to fly home in the jump seat, the third seat in the cockpit, for the whole of the flight from Southampton to Belfast and that was absolutely amazing — it’s not something that you normally get to do, to see what the captain and the pilots do.“You get to see the take-off and the landing and you’re watching the ground coming closer and closer — it’s absolutely amazing.”Philip, a rep for Unite the Union, was on a health and safety course in Carlisle when he learned that Flybe had closed down.“I spent all night talking to members on the phone — they were like brothers and sisters and uncles and aunts. It had to be the worst day of my le, the loss of that job,” he says.“I never realised until it was coming to an end how much it takes over your le. I loved going to work.“The company went into administration on March  and the following week, the country started to go into lockdown. We were dealing with our members, trying to get them sorted, updating their CVs and making sure all monies were arranged. We had a two-week period of manic activity, trying to get people organised, and all of a sudden it was locked down and you couldn’t do it anymore.”After going into lockdown, Philip fell ill and was in self-isolation for nearly four weeks.“I had every symptom, other than the cough — a sore chest, my body was so sore, I couldn’t even get out of bed most days. I don’t know whether it was the mental exhaustion after two weeks of living on adrenaline rushes. Karl had a cough, but nothing untoward, but he wasn’t right — we both definitely weren’t right.“I’ve had many, many bad colds when I was flying — you pick up anything that is going around — but that had to be the worst. “Six of us that had been in the same group all had symptoms and we all feel we had some form of coronavirus, but you can’t get tested as you are just a number to this government.”After recovering, Philip has spent the time in lockdown painting and decorating and taken part in weekly Zoom quizzes with friends, but has barely left the house.“My father, Paul Land, was a Cha pensioner in London and he got Covid and died on April . My brother had to arrange a virtual cremation for him,” he says.“Things have been hard. I am a mental health first-aider, which has been a lesaver for me, because there are times when you just think... why ”Philip says that unless Flybe s or is replaced with a small regional airline, he can’t see himself being able to work in the airline industry again.“My concern is that there is so little connectivity now with the mainland from Belfast. We don’t have the bridge Boris Johnson is talking about, we don’t have a tunnel to get across. WI’d cut my arm off to get a job in the industry again. It was an amazing experience, but it’s going to take time for it to settle down and how are they going to work with self-distancing “If they’re doing a deep clean for each flight, that’s at least an hour. Things are going to be very dferent.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseCaoimhe Leigh Harkin has been in lockdown in Dubai since March, having become an Emirates cabin crew employee last year FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappCaoimhe Leigh Harkin has been in lockdown in Dubai since March, having become an Emirates cabin crew employee last year‘If it takes two years for things to go back to normal, my contract will be over...but I may go home to my family’Caoimhe Leigh Harkin , from Co Tyrone, has been a flight attendant with Emirates since last March and has been in lockdown in Dubai. She originally graduated in journalism in  before working as a travel journalist in Dublin, but was keen to travel before settling down. She was hired by Emirates in February last year after attending an open day.“Before all of this, the job has been wonderful. I have loved the travel and the whole experience,” she says.“I’ve been to Australia, Italy, South Africa, and I’ve done some amazing things. I’ve been to Bali, Mauritius — I’ve been to places I would probably never have been toI hadn’t taken the job. I thought, ‘If I don’t do this now, I’ll never do it’.“With Emirates, every day is so dferent. You have  days off a month in Dubai and you do seven or eight flights, some of which are layovers, or they could be turnaround flights, where you leave Dubai that day and come back that night.“It’s been the best year of my le — there’s literally no words to describe it. The hardest thing is jet lag and being sleep deprived — you just sleep when you can. But when you’re going into a layover for  hours when it’s somewhere you’ve never been before, you just have to go and see that place and do without the sleep.”Caoimhe lives in an Emirates-owned accommodation tower along with many other crew members.“We’ve made a wee family out here — me and my best friends live in the towers beside each other. Every day is dferent, there’s something always going on in Dubai.”At the start of the pandemic, the city was in -hour lockdown with tighter restrictions than in the UK, she says.“We needed a permit even to get groceries and you only got the permit once every three days. You had to input your UEA identication andyou went before your three days was up, you got declined.

They literally have drones going round the streets sterilising them —only everywhere could do it the way Dubai does it,” Caoimhe says.Her last flight was on March  and she has been in lockdown ever since, and found it hard to adjust to a less active lestyle.But with the relaxation in lockdown, she was able to book a hotel in the city and stay there for five nights with some friends.“It has a suite with a private pool and the views are amazing over the skyline of Dubai,” Caominhe says.“We have our own rooms, but we’re able to spend time together, which is nice. The hotel is only for residents of Dubai. We have to be in by pm and can’t leave the hotel until am, and we’re still sticking to the guidelines because we’re not in one room. The past five days have been really nice, but it’s back to reality tomorrow.”Caominhe says Emirates is bringing staff back in phases.“There’s a lot of negativity in the news about other airlines, but Emirates don’t have that at all... they’re making people stay on top of their safety procedures before we get started back.“We’re on standby and you have to be preparedyou’re called for a flight. If you’re called to do a flight, you have to quarantine for  days afterwards.”But she says she’s not sure what to do in the long term. Her contract lasts for three years and Caoimhe wasn’t intending to do a second contract afterwards.“If it takes two years for things to go back to normal, my contract will be over and I didn’t plan to stay longer. I’m trying to be smart about it, but my decision may be going back and spending time with my family — maybe it’s a sign,” she says.

His younger years coincided with a bright spell in the clubs history. He spoke to Michael McMullan about losing championships, winning the John McLaughlin Cup and building for the future. Gutty McGlone is no dferent to any other competitor. Defeat hits him like a sledgehammer. It festers to the very pit of his stomach. Its county final afternoon in  and an emerging Lavey team savour the sweet aroma of victory. Inside, in the corner of the Glen dressing room, McGlone reflects. The remnants of their - to - defeat get tossed through his mind again, something only disappointment can do. googletag.cmd.push The pitter patter of water in the adjoining shower area stops. The noise you only hear above the eerie silence of failure. John McErlain, Liam Devlin and Damian Barton emerge. Their confab draws a common conclusion. They had left three titles behind them. Next year will be dferent. In , -year-old McGlones debut season, the Bridge didnt stand up for themselves in the championship against Ballinderry, before losing the game. Eamonn Coleman was manager and after making him a regular from the mid-point of the league, Hugh wasnt selected for the championship defeat to the Shamrocks, with Coleman later confessing it was about protecting him for a career ahead. He just wasnt ready. googletag.cmd.push Three years earlier, torn ligaments in McGlones right ankle, sustained in school action for St Pius, worked out for the best. “Before that, I couldnt kick with my weak foot,” recalls Hugh, who would later coach at underage and engineer the foundations for the current senior team. He remembers the late Brendan Convery insisting on ato school training once he could walk, before arming him with a bag of balls. “Convery made me stand on the and kick every ball into the goals with my left foot. The next week, he made me go to the ,” McGlone clearly remembers. The man who managed Laveys All-Ireland winning team was developing McGlone without him even knowing. “I gradually got stronger and stronger and thats where I ended up playing at left corner back for the Bridge seniors at , because I had two feet and was able to go up the line...that was all down to Brendan Convery.” St Pius annexed an U Vocational Schools All-Ireland, with McGlone on board. A year later, in , Derry minors, who played most of the game with  men following the first-minute dismissal of Gregory McCloskey, were beaten by a point in Newry by Down, who went on to win the All-Ireland. McGlone lined out at corner back and a year more experienced, had established himself as a regular on the Bridge senior team. Once again, they crossed paths with Ballinderry. After having previously taken two games to beat Magherafelt, they met the Shamrocks in the infamous semi-final replay encounter at Greenlough. Newbridge came through to play Dungiven in a final.  The Newbridge team pictured before the  Derry senior final It wasnt to be. Newbridge were going to stand their ground this time. Familiarity bred contempt and after another tempestuous battle with the Shamrocks, which saw pitch invasions, Newbridge were thrown out leaving Dungiven to be awarded the title in the boardroom. Losing was becoming a habit and in the aftermath of their  defeat, before leaving Glen, they made a pact. “We are going to learn from this,” McGlone relays of the collective dressing room message. “We left one , we didnt get playing in oneand now we have lost one. We are not going to lose another one.” *** You earned your corn at Newbridge training. The championship jersey wasnt handed out willy nilly. Gutty McGlone, the youngest of seven boys in a house of  children, would leave home for the short walk to the hall for a Saturday pre-championship meeting before the  final. He was unnecessarily uneasy. “Im not sure of my position here,” McGlone thought. He was ever-present and never substituted during the year, but Stephen Walls, an All-Ireland minor winner with Derry in , was breathing down McGlones neck. “Thats the class of player we had on the bench. I knew I had played well, but because of the competition at the time in the Newbridge team, I was thinking I could get a gunk here I knew the pressure was on, thats why you had to perform.” It was an era that secured back-to-back senior leagues in  and , as well as three reserve championships inside five years. “This just wasnt about the senior team, those three teams were the pinnacle of us winning thechampionship in ,” McGlone stated, in no uncertain terms. Before emphasising it again. “We played games at training during ...it was a senior team against a reserve team. We struggled to beat them, so that shows you the class of talent we had in Newbridge at that time.” McGlone name-checks Mickey McGrogan and Shane Doherty as some of the forwards who trotted into his left corner back area in training games, players not even listed on the -man match-day  for the final. And they gave him his fill of it. “Then, you had big Hugh McGrogan, Paudis Da, running around at midfield, kicking the shite out of Damian Barton. There was no respect given whatsoever.” It was dog eat dog. And it needed to be. This was to be the year. “Rabbiand Sam , our managers, picked  seniors against  reserves, so we would learn how to play together in games.” The seniors never overran their reserve counterparts. “Not a chance,” Gutty stresses. The seniors never won by any more than four or five points, with the reserves winning the odd game. It worked wonders when it mattered. “Any time we were down by a couple of points , that team didnt know when it was beat. Now it mightnt have been the silkiest team, but boys just never quit,” Hugh admits. After three years of knocking on the door, with the pain of defeat lingering like a dark cloud and with the younger players beginning to mature, it was time to die dog or shite the licence. *** There was another ingredient. Sam Bateson is described by McGlone as the tactician with his managerial partner Thomas Fullerton also knowing his football. The perfect match. Fullerton, a reserve winning captain, was playing with McGlone in a  Graham Cup game. Magherafelt were running them ragged and led by six or seven points at the interval. “It was one of the first times I saw we had steel and other teams didnt have, Thomas went f**king ballistic at half-time,” Gutty remembers. It was a watershed moment. The law was laid down. Like the rest of the team, McGlone imposed himself. They were like men possessed and won the game well. “I was niggling with my man and remember him filling my mouth when we began to get on top,” said McGlone, who walked off the pitch with blood running out of his nose. “Hes not playing football in the next round, but we are,” Rabbi uttered to him, with a laugh. “Thats when I thought, the odd slap in the mouth doesnt matter, as long as you come out on the right side of it.” Another piece of valuable advice was dished out by John McErlain who often played in front of him on the left wing. In his early days, McGlone would often hoof the ball to safety. As a young buck, and under pressure, it was safer than getting caught in possession. “John roared at me one day in a league game,” he remembers. “I was told to either use the ball up the wing or just lay it off. Its those wee things that helps you when you are growing up.” As the  season began to grow, Newbridge beat  champions Bellaghy in the first round, followed by a hard-earned victory over  winners Glenullin and a semi-final encounter win over Banagher. It took them to the decider against neighbours Castledawson. Midway through the first-half, Brian McErlain was sent off. In the reshuffle, Damian Barton dropped back to centre-back. “Damian was that good with the long pass, that we didnt really have to attack and we could keep six at the back,” McGlone said of his captain. “He was able to get the ball to Devand Paddy Barton up there. On that day, I thought the Newbridge defence was outstanding...everybody. It was tight, it was hard hitting and Castledawson didnt get going.” They knew that Eamonn Heaney wasnt going to make Dawsons starting team, but would play a part. He had played at full-back in the  final, but was now threw in at full-forward to help rescue the game. It wasnt long before Rabbi was out over the sideline to instruct McGlone to do a marking job on Colm McKee for the remainder of the game, having blotted out the substituted Mickey Hughes. “Neither me or Colm touched the ball, but the management had trust in us. I was the youngest man on our team and they were happy to leave me on their county man.” Having played in three county finals and losing two of them, McGlone – who has a memory for detail that matches his enthusiasm – always remembers the call for stewards to pick up their end of match positions. “Its one of the worst feelings you could have as a footballer when you are getting beat by two or three points,” he recalls. One year on from hearing it against Lavey in , they led Castledawson when the announcement bellowed out. He remembers dampening Eoin Gribbins joy at the thought of having their clutches on that elusive championship. “One goal and they are back in it,” McGlone warned him. “In the Lavey game, it seemed to last  seconds until the final whistle, but when it was called that year , we were ahead...it seemed like an eternity until the whistle.” Newbridge were not to be caught. They kept their promise from  months earlier and Damian Barton collected the John McLaughlin Cup after a -year gap, for their th and last title. From McGlones recollection, win lose or draw, Wilfie Garvin, Mick McKenna, Jim Gilmore, Seamus and Dermot Doherty, Owen and Willie Gribbin would always be in the Newbridge dressing room after games. They were part of the teams fabric. “I remember those boys being in the day we won it and I was never as glad to see it. Its one of the wee things I will always remember.” Later in the evening the team went for a meal at the ONeill Arms in Toome, before heading back to Newbridge Hall for the celebrations. McGlone wasnt a teetotaller, he enjoyed a drink like most of the others and it was curbed during the championship preparations. “I never touched drink the night we won the championship, not one pint,” Gutty said of his premeditated decision. “I wanted to savour the whole thing and not to be talking to the older men around the club and me maybe half tight.” The next two or three days were dferent. Between the Elk and the Thatch, it was party central. On the Monday night, the squad did a tour of Newbridge on the back of Mick McKennas lorry.   Derry champions Newbridge “Everyone was on the back of er,” Gutty laughs. “We went down to Toome to pick up Stephen McErlain and then did every road in Newbridge. You wouldve thought there were  cars behind us. For the next two or three days, I dont think we sobered.” They were at the top of Everest. But surprisingly, being one of the most consistent teams of the time, it was the only senior championship that crop won. In , they took the foot off the pedal and lost to Ballinascreen in the semi-final who were beaten by eventual All-Ireland champions Lavey. “In  Eugene Young came in to manage us and we got to the final. We missed two goals and theyscored two goals, that was the dference in us winning another one.” While picking up intermediate silverware in the interim, he recalls the disappointment of relegation in  after surviving for three or four seasons in play-offs. “To start your career with a championship medal in your pocket at  or , struggling and relegation was tough. To go from being top of the pile...from walking around behind bands, to relegation, it was tough.” McGlone picked up an intermediate medal in , but when the same title ed five years later, he had stepped away from the seniors, choosing to play with the reserves. Gutty was coaxed out back into the senior ranks by manager Gavin Devlin for an impact role at full-forward, using his guile to pull full-back lines of position. A dead leg suffered in , a niggle that never fully cleared up told McGlone it was time to pull the pin. In retirement, he was never going to step away from the game he loved. The buzz in his voice, with every word dancing, speaks volumes for his fanaticism for football. He stayed on as long as he could, with the club having little youth coming through. It was time to dig new foundations and survey the lie of the land in the local school. “There were big numbers from U down, so we decided wed start with the underage,” states Hugh, who had the help of Neil Young, Martin Gribbin and Gabriel Farren. It was the clubs first U U group, as part of a unofficial South Derry underage initiative. With clubs coaching for three weeks and playing a blitz on the fourth week. “We couldnt believe it, when all  of them turned up at the first session,” he said of a group that supplied seven players to the senior team beaten by Slaughtneil in last years championship. “By U, CKcame in to help. He had taken teams around Newbridge that boysdidnt want, hed step up. Noel McPeake and Sean McKenna came in too and helped.” After winning the U B league and championship, McGlone took a break before ing at minor level and asked for another step up in class. At the pre-season meeting he asked those in the room with two B medals to stand up. “About  percent stood up and when asked who has at least one , and the rest of them stood,” McGlone states. It was time to move up to the A grade. In their first game, they were away to Slaughtneil and unlucky not to beat a team who were U champions two years earlier. After losing heavily to Magherafelt in the Hughes McElwee Cup, the league game between them finished in a draw.  The  Newbridge U U  “If you win a Byou have to step up to A. We were not going to win anything. If we played somebody and there was  points in it and we played them a second day and there was two points in it, we are progressing.” McGlone expressed. He was looking further down the track. His sons are now playing on the senior team, he helped shape. In recent years, they picked up another intermediate title and are back in the top flight. Hopefully to stay. “Now we have a  again that,nurtured right, can dine at the top table again. Hopefully...I am one of the men that is going in around the dressing room in the next five or six years like the older boys did when we won.” Guttys fanaticism has never diluted, nor is it likely to.

His younger years coincided with a bright spell in the clubs history. He spoke to Michael McMullan about losing championships, winning the John McLaughlin Cup and building for the future. Gutty McGlone is no dferent to any other competitor. Defeat hits him like a sledgehammer. It festers to the very pit of his stomach. Its county final afternoon in  and an emerging Lavey team savour the sweet aroma of victory. Inside, in the corner of the Glen dressing room, McGlone reflects. The remnants of their - to - defeat get tossed through his mind again, something only disappointment can do. googletag.cmd.push The pitter patter of water in the adjoining shower area stops. The noise you only hear above the eerie silence of failure. John McErlain, Liam Devlin and Damian Barton emerge. Their confab draws a common conclusion. They had left three titles behind them. Next year will be dferent. In , -year-old McGlones debut season, the Bridge didnt stand up for themselves in the championship against Ballinderry, before losing the game. Eamonn Coleman was manager and after making him a regular from the mid-point of the league, Hugh wasnt selected for the championship defeat to the Shamrocks, with Coleman later confessing it was about protecting him for a career ahead. He just wasnt ready. googletag.cmd.push Three years earlier, torn ligaments in McGlones right ankle, sustained in school action for St Pius, worked out for the best. “Before that, I couldnt kick with my weak foot,” recalls Hugh, who would later coach at underage and engineer the foundations for the current senior team. He remembers the late Brendan Convery insisting on ato school training once he could walk, before arming him with a bag of balls. “Convery made me stand on the and kick every ball into the goals with my left foot. The next week, he made me go to the ,” McGlone clearly remembers. The man who managed Laveys All-Ireland winning team was developing McGlone without him even knowing. “I gradually got stronger and stronger and thats where I ended up playing at left corner back for the Bridge seniors at , because I had two feet and was able to go up the line...that was all down to Brendan Convery.” St Pius annexed an U Vocational Schools All-Ireland, with McGlone on board. A year later, in , Derry minors, who played most of the game with  men following the first-minute dismissal of Gregory McCloskey, were beaten by a point in Newry by Down, who went on to win the All-Ireland. McGlone lined out at corner back and a year more experienced, had established himself as a regular on the Bridge senior team. Once again, they crossed paths with Ballinderry. After having previously taken two games to beat Magherafelt, they met the Shamrocks in the infamous semi-final replay encounter at Greenlough. Newbridge came through to play Dungiven in a final.  The Newbridge team pictured before the  Derry senior final It wasnt to be. Newbridge were going to stand their ground this time. Familiarity bred contempt and after another tempestuous battle with the Shamrocks, which saw pitch invasions, Newbridge were thrown out leaving Dungiven to be awarded the title in the boardroom. Losing was becoming a habit and in the aftermath of their  defeat, before leaving Glen, they made a pact. “We are going to learn from this,” McGlone relays of the collective dressing room message. “We left one , we didnt get playing in oneand now we have lost one. We are not going to lose another one.” *** You earned your corn at Newbridge training. The championship jersey wasnt handed out willy nilly. Gutty McGlone, the youngest of seven boys in a house of  children, would leave home for the short walk to the hall for a Saturday pre-championship meeting before the  final. He was unnecessarily uneasy. “Im not sure of my position here,” McGlone thought. He was ever-present and never substituted during the year, but Stephen Walls, an All-Ireland minor winner with Derry in , was breathing down McGlones neck. “Thats the class of player we had on the bench. I knew I had played well, but because of the competition at the time in the Newbridge team, I was thinking I could get a gunk here I knew the pressure was on, thats why you had to perform.” It was an era that secured back-to-back senior leagues in  and , as well as three reserve championships inside five years. “This just wasnt about the senior team, those three teams were the pinnacle of us winning thechampionship in ,” McGlone stated, in no uncertain terms. Before emphasising it again. “We played games at training during ...it was a senior team against a reserve team. We struggled to beat them, so that shows you the class of talent we had in Newbridge at that time.” McGlone name-checks Mickey McGrogan and Shane Doherty as some of the forwards who trotted into his left corner back area in training games, players not even listed on the -man match-day  for the final. And they gave him his fill of it. “Then, you had big Hugh McGrogan, Paudis Da, running around at midfield, kicking the shite out of Damian Barton. There was no respect given whatsoever.” It was dog eat dog. And it needed to be. This was to be the year. “Rabbiand Sam , our managers, picked  seniors against  reserves, so we would learn how to play together in games.” The seniors never overran their reserve counterparts. “Not a chance,” Gutty stresses. The seniors never won by any more than four or five points, with the reserves winning the odd game. It worked wonders when it mattered. “Any time we were down by a couple of points , that team didnt know when it was beat. Now it mightnt have been the silkiest team, but boys just never quit,” Hugh admits. After three years of knocking on the door, with the pain of defeat lingering like a dark cloud and with the younger players beginning to mature, it was time to die dog or shite the licence. *** There was another ingredient. Sam Bateson is described by McGlone as the tactician with his managerial partner Thomas Fullerton also knowing his football. The perfect match. Fullerton, a reserve winning captain, was playing with McGlone in a  Graham Cup game. Magherafelt were running them ragged and led by six or seven points at the interval. “It was one of the first times I saw we had steel and other teams didnt have, Thomas went f**king ballistic at half-time,” Gutty remembers. It was a watershed moment. The law was laid down. Like the rest of the team, McGlone imposed himself. They were like men possessed and won the game well. “I was niggling with my man and remember him filling my mouth when we began to get on top,” said McGlone, who walked off the pitch with blood running out of his nose. “Hes not playing football in the next round, but we are,” Rabbi uttered to him, with a laugh. “Thats when I thought, the odd slap in the mouth doesnt matter, as long as you come out on the right side of it.” Another piece of valuable advice was dished out by John McErlain who often played in front of him on the left wing. In his early days, McGlone would often hoof the ball to safety. As a young buck, and under pressure, it was safer than getting caught in possession. “John roared at me one day in a league game,” he remembers. “I was told to either use the ball up the wing or just lay it off. Its those wee things that helps you when you are growing up.” As the  season began to grow, Newbridge beat  champions Bellaghy in the first round, followed by a hard-earned victory over  winners Glenullin and a semi-final encounter win over Banagher. It took them to the decider against neighbours Castledawson. Midway through the first-half, Brian McErlain was sent off. In the reshuffle, Damian Barton dropped back to centre-back. “Damian was that good with the long pass, that we didnt really have to attack and we could keep six at the back,” McGlone said of his captain. “He was able to get the ball to Devand Paddy Barton up there. On that day, I thought the Newbridge defence was outstanding...everybody. It was tight, it was hard hitting and Castledawson didnt get going.” They knew that Eamonn Heaney wasnt going to make Dawsons starting team, but would play a part. He had played at full-back in the  final, but was now threw in at full-forward to help rescue the game. It wasnt long before Rabbi was out over the sideline to instruct McGlone to do a marking job on Colm McKee for the remainder of the game, having blotted out the substituted Mickey Hughes. “Neither me or Colm touched the ball, but the management had trust in us. I was the youngest man on our team and they were happy to leave me on their county man.” Having played in three county finals and losing two of them, McGlone – who has a memory for detail that matches his enthusiasm – always remembers the call for stewards to pick up their end of match positions. “Its one of the worst feelings you could have as a footballer when you are getting beat by two or three points,” he recalls. One year on from hearing it against Lavey in , they led Castledawson when the announcement bellowed out. He remembers dampening Eoin Gribbins joy at the thought of having their clutches on that elusive championship. “One goal and they are back in it,” McGlone warned him. “In the Lavey game, it seemed to last  seconds until the final whistle, but when it was called that year , we were ahead...it seemed like an eternity until the whistle.” Newbridge were not to be caught. They kept their promise from  months earlier and Damian Barton collected the John McLaughlin Cup after a -year gap, for their th and last title. From McGlones recollection, win lose or draw, Wilfie Garvin, Mick McKenna, Jim Gilmore, Seamus and Dermot Doherty, Owen and Willie Gribbin would always be in the Newbridge dressing room after games. They were part of the teams fabric. “I remember those boys being in the day we won it and I was never as glad to see it. Its one of the wee things I will always remember.” Later in the evening the team went for a meal at the ONeill Arms in Toome, before heading back to Newbridge Hall for the celebrations. McGlone wasnt a teetotaller, he enjoyed a drink like most of the others and it was curbed during the championship preparations. “I never touched drink the night we won the championship, not one pint,” Gutty said of his premeditated decision. “I wanted to savour the whole thing and not to be talking to the older men around the club and me maybe half tight.” The next two or three days were dferent. Between the Elk and the Thatch, it was party central. On the Monday night, the squad did a tour of Newbridge on the back of Mick McKennas lorry.   Derry champions Newbridge “Everyone was on the back of er,” Gutty laughs. “We went down to Toome to pick up Stephen McErlain and then did every road in Newbridge. You wouldve thought there were  cars behind us. For the next two or three days, I dont think we sobered.” They were at the top of Everest. But surprisingly, being one of the most consistent teams of the time, it was the only senior championship that crop won. In , they took the foot off the pedal and lost to Ballinascreen in the semi-final who were beaten by eventual All-Ireland champions Lavey. “In  Eugene Young came in to manage us and we got to the final. We missed two goals and theyscored two goals, that was the dference in us winning another one.” While picking up intermediate silverware in the interim, he recalls the disappointment of relegation in  after surviving for three or four seasons in play-offs. “To start your career with a championship medal in your pocket at  or , struggling and relegation was tough. To go from being top of the pile...from walking around behind bands, to relegation, it was tough.” McGlone picked up an intermediate medal in , but when the same title ed five years later, he had stepped away from the seniors, choosing to play with the reserves. Gutty was coaxed out back into the senior ranks by manager Gavin Devlin for an impact role at full-forward, using his guile to pull full-back lines of position. A dead leg suffered in , a niggle that never fully cleared up told McGlone it was time to pull the pin. In retirement, he was never going to step away from the game he loved. The buzz in his voice, with every word dancing, speaks volumes for his fanaticism for football. He stayed on as long as he could, with the club having little youth coming through. It was time to dig new foundations and survey the lie of the land in the local school. “There were big numbers from U down, so we decided wed start with the underage,” states Hugh, who had the help of Neil Young, Martin Gribbin and Gabriel Farren. It was the clubs first U U group, as part of a unofficial South Derry underage initiative. With clubs coaching for three weeks and playing a blitz on the fourth week. “We couldnt believe it, when all  of them turned up at the first session,” he said of a group that supplied seven players to the senior team beaten by Slaughtneil in last years championship. “By U, CKcame in to help. He had taken teams around Newbridge that boysdidnt want, hed step up. Noel McPeake and Sean McKenna came in too and helped.” After winning the U B league and championship, McGlone took a break before ing at minor level and asked for another step up in class. At the pre-season meeting he asked those in the room with two B medals to stand up. “About  percent stood up and when asked who has at least one , and the rest of them stood,” McGlone states. It was time to move up to the A grade. In their first game, they were away to Slaughtneil and unlucky not to beat a team who were U champions two years earlier. After losing heavily to Magherafelt in the Hughes McElwee Cup, the league game between them finished in a draw.  The  Newbridge U U  “If you win a Byou have to step up to A. We were not going to win anything. If we played somebody and there was  points in it and we played them a second day and there was two points in it, we are progressing.” McGlone expressed. He was looking further down the track. His sons are now playing on the senior team, he helped shape. In recent years, they picked up another intermediate title and are back in the top flight. Hopefully to stay. “Now we have a  again that,nurtured right, can dine at the top table again. Hopefully...I am one of the men that is going in around the dressing room in the next five or six years like the older boys did when we won.” Guttys fanaticism has never diluted, nor is it likely to.

GAA GOLD, a new archive based series from TG, looks back at the ’s through the prism of the GAA year.  Each programme focuses on one year and we travel through the GAA season with a mixture of all of the classic games, news stories and music hits from that year. The first programme of the series starts with the year and the programmecharts that year’s twists and turns on Gaelic fields throughout the land with league finals, provincial finals, All-Ireland semi-finals and All-Ireland finals. That year end ends with Joe Connolly’s emotional and evocative speech on the steps of the Hogan Stand with the cheeky line of “People of Galway, we love you! googletag.cmd.push In  All Ireland Football Final, there was Seacuteamus Darbys famous goal that shocked Kerry - and the nation - to end their five in-a-row hopes. In the Hurling Final the Cats claimed their nd All-Ireland title captained by a young man named Brian Cody. In  we will see Jimmy Barry-Murphy’s famous rocket goal against Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final. Michael O’Hehir on commentary said“This is one you need to see in slow motion but the slow motion won’t even slow it down!”.  In the Minor hurling final there is a young man named Niall Quinn playing for the Dubs against Galway. He scored a great point on the day and would go on to score  international goals for the Republic of Ireland soccer team. The Football Final that year saw  players sent off in the Dublin v Galway battle. googletag.cmd.push The series will include the  Ulster Football Final - Frank McGuigan was on fire for Tyrone that day and scored  points from play - each one better than the last as Tyrone claimed their first provincial title since  in Clones.  This was also the GAA’s centenary year with the All-Ireland Hurling Final held in Semple Stadium between Cork and Offaly. We hwill see the first ever International Rules tests between Ireland and Australia from that year with plenty of action on and off the ball. In  we have some action from the first ever Ladies Football Final to be played at Croke Park. The Kerry’s Ladies team went one better than the men as they claimed a‘five in-a-row’ with victory over Wexford. There are other more quirkier events in the GAA season too. In  a National Football League Quarter-final between Dublin and Cork ended in a draw. Cork failed to reappear for extra-time so Dublin ran the ball down unopposed and shot into an empty Cork net to claim a very unusual victory. All of these great memories can be seen in this new GAA GOLD series with the soundtrack of the era - a mix of both international and Irish acts such as U, Thin Lizzy, The Pogues, Mamas Boys, The Undertones, Cry Before Dawn, Sineacutead O’Connor, The Dubliners, The Hothouse Flowers, The Stunning and many more.

It was the greatest walk of all and following the opening of Shamrock Park, following the sporting lockdown, they are again thinking of that famous journey to Thurles. On the re-opening of walkways around GAA grounds, this was an opportunity to get people back out again socialising as a club community and using the club grounds with their Trip  Tipp initiative. The idea was to get as many families as possible out walking, running or crawling, each doing a  mile leg of the  mile journey in allocated, socially distanced, safe slots. googletag.cmd.push A pound contribution per family was requested, with all proceeds going to aid football and camogie youth restarting back training, with the expected rules and regulations that will surely be in place. The uptake was fantastic with  families taking partand more families looking to take part every day so they surpassed their  mile journey!. The club wish to place on record their thanks to all those that participated or helped out in any way preparing the grounds, sorting and fitting hand sanitizers, marking the walkways for one way social distance adherence, with special mention to Paul McIver who was the driving force behind this excellent initiative. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

When he came out of the changing room bearing a grey hoodie, with the rest of his team-mates in black and white, you wondered had he even got a jersey. But whatever he dreamt about on the night before, whatever he thought about over dinner, he wouldn’t have believed he would have scored an injury-time goal to win the trophy for his new club and win the man of the match award. googletag.cmd.push That’s exactly how it panned out. The sides level at - apiece, thirty seconds of injury-time played, and a long ball is spilled and flapped at by Ronan Tracey in the Foreglen goal. Poaching on the edge of the small square , as he did time and again in the green and gold jersey, it was a simple task for O’Kane to punch home the winning goal. Some ironies are just written in the stars. This one came in spite of every single ounce of effort Foreglen had to give. Kevin O’Connor was O’Kane’s partner in crime since the two were knee high. They tormented defences in Intermediate football for years. They fought shoulder to shoulder for the green and the gold. googletag.cmd.push O’Connor played like a man possessed. He played like a man who wanted to show the world he didn’t need a partner. The Foreglen forward took Rian Kealey, a superb player, to the cleaners. O’Connor ended up with five points and set up his side’s goal in a magnicent display. That goal, made by O’Connor and finished by James Brolly, looked as though it had swung the balance in the favour of the underdogs with just four minutes to go. Having been behind from the th minute of a rather stagnant first half, Foreglen had worked incredibly hard to stay in touch with the Magpies. A combination of wasteful finishing from Eugene Kelly’s menand superb defending from a young full-back line of Ruairi and Shane Duffy and Cathal O’Hara kept Damien O’Connor’s side in contention. This was no holds barred football. For the young Dungiven side, sprinkled with Kevin Farren, Kevin Johnston, Sean Murray and Donal McGilligan of last year’s minor team, this was probably the toughest game they’ve played, in a physical sense at least. For that, you have to give Foreglen great credit. Brothers John and Oisin Duffy were lost to their defence before the game, having set off travelling on Friday. They’re without Niall McFeely long term. To most teams with as small a pick, those absentees would be terminal against a side that contained six players that played in last year’s senior county final. But when have Foreglen ever laid down  Kevin O’Connor might have kicked the points, but the spadework was done by plenty other. Ciaran McFeely had an excellent game, the best he’s played in some while. He went after everything, especially in the second half. Darren O’Kane’s heart is bigger than his chest. There’s not much of him, but he ploughs into everything. He’s pretty much the Foreglen prototype. They felt the big decisions didn’t go their way. They may have had a point. Directly after Brolly’s goal, Martin Farrell latched on to a great ball from Darren O’Kane. He appeared to be fouled in front of goal but referee Joe Mulholland blew him for over-carrying. Ninety seconds after what turned out to be Darrell O’Kane’s winning goal, Kevin O’Connor was pushed in the chest inside the area as he collected the ball. The referee felt he went down too easily and played on. But for all the feeling of the world being against them, they were lucky to still be in the game at half-time. Having played with a fresh breeze, they were frustrated by constant stoppages over a stop-start  minutes. With  minutes of -a-side football played, the score was just - apiece. It hadn’t caught fire at all. But Dungiven were missing what chances were being made. They kicked ten wides in that half hour. Foreglen had just three points at the break, but just as importantly, they had conceded just five. What the fans were treated to in the second half was night and day from what they had got in the first. It became a rip-roaring game. It effectively became championship. The first seven minutes of the half were scoreless. The stage seemed set. James McNicholl got out well and fed the man coming off his shoulder. That man fired brilliantly past Ronan Tracey from twelve yards. That man had no fear of celebrating his goal. That man was, of course, Darrell O’Kane. Foreglen seemed to react to the identity of the scorer as much as the goal itself. They responded in the most positive manner. Martin Farrell , Ciaran McFeely, Kevin O’Connor and James Brolly hit points in six brilliant minutes to close the gap back to two. Dungiven’s only response in those six minutes came from O’Kane’s right foot. Kevin O’Connor was not letting it go without a fight. His storming run saw Rian Kealey pull him to the ground along the endline. He got up and sprinted out to the ’ and with Dungiven sleeping, took a quick free that left James Brolly with a relatively simple finish from  yards. That levelled it with just four minutes to play. But they couldn’t quite get the score they needed to nose themselves in front. They just didn’t have anything to hold on to. Substitute Fergal McGuigan kicked a  yard free wide and it seemed as though the gods, having rescued Kerry earlier in the day, had dressed themselves in green and gold. But it just had to be Darrell O’Kane’s day. Of all the men in all the world, it just had to be him.

When he came out of the changing room bearing a grey hoodie, with the rest of his team-mates in black and white, you wondered had he even got a jersey. But whatever he dreamt about on the night before, whatever he thought about over dinner, he wouldn’t have believed he would have scored an injury-time goal to win the trophy for his new club and win the man of the match award. googletag.cmd.push That’s exactly how it panned out. The sides level at - apiece, thirty seconds of injury-time played, and a long ball is spilled and flapped at by Ronan Tracey in the Foreglen goal. Poaching on the edge of the small square , as he did time and again in the green and gold jersey, it was a simple task for O’Kane to punch home the winning goal. Some ironies are just written in the stars. This one came in spite of every single ounce of effort Foreglen had to give. Kevin O’Connor was O’Kane’s partner in crime since the two were knee high. They tormented defences in Intermediate football for years. They fought shoulder to shoulder for the green and the gold. googletag.cmd.push O’Connor played like a man possessed. He played like a man who wanted to show the world he didn’t need a partner. The Foreglen forward took Rian Kealey, a superb player, to the cleaners. O’Connor ended up with five points and set up his side’s goal in a magnicent display. That goal, made by O’Connor and finished by James Brolly, looked as though it had swung the balance in the favour of the underdogs with just four minutes to go. Having been behind from the th minute of a rather stagnant first half, Foreglen had worked incredibly hard to stay in touch with the Magpies. A combination of wasteful finishing from Eugene Kelly’s menand superb defending from a young full-back line of Ruairi and Shane Duffy and Cathal O’Hara kept Damien O’Connor’s side in contention. This was no holds barred football. For the young Dungiven side, sprinkled with Kevin Farren, Kevin Johnston, Sean Murray and Donal McGilligan of last year’s minor team, this was probably the toughest game they’ve played, in a physical sense at least. For that, you have to give Foreglen great credit. Brothers John and Oisin Duffy were lost to their defence before the game, having set off travelling on Friday. They’re without Niall McFeely long term. To most teams with as small a pick, those absentees would be terminal against a side that contained six players that played in last year’s senior county final. But when have Foreglen ever laid down  Kevin O’Connor might have kicked the points, but the spadework was done by plenty other. Ciaran McFeely had an excellent game, the best he’s played in some while. He went after everything, especially in the second half. Darren O’Kane’s heart is bigger than his chest. There’s not much of him, but he ploughs into everything. He’s pretty much the Foreglen prototype. They felt the big decisions didn’t go their way. They may have had a point. Directly after Brolly’s goal, Martin Farrell latched on to a great ball from Darren O’Kane. He appeared to be fouled in front of goal but referee Joe Mulholland blew him for over-carrying. Ninety seconds after what turned out to be Darrell O’Kane’s winning goal, Kevin O’Connor was pushed in the chest inside the area as he collected the ball. The referee felt he went down too easily and played on. But for all the feeling of the world being against them, they were lucky to still be in the game at half-time. Having played with a fresh breeze, they were frustrated by constant stoppages over a stop-start  minutes. With  minutes of -a-side football played, the score was just - apiece. It hadn’t caught fire at all. But Dungiven were missing what chances were being made. They kicked ten wides in that half hour. Foreglen had just three points at the break, but just as importantly, they had conceded just five. What the fans were treated to in the second half was night and day from what they had got in the first. It became a rip-roaring game. It effectively became championship. The first seven minutes of the half were scoreless. The stage seemed set. James McNicholl got out well and fed the man coming off his shoulder. That man fired brilliantly past Ronan Tracey from twelve yards. That man had no fear of celebrating his goal. That man was, of course, Darrell O’Kane. Foreglen seemed to react to the identity of the scorer as much as the goal itself. They responded in the most positive manner. Martin Farrell , Ciaran McFeely, Kevin O’Connor and James Brolly hit points in six brilliant minutes to close the gap back to two. Dungiven’s only response in those six minutes came from O’Kane’s right foot. Kevin O’Connor was not letting it go without a fight. His storming run saw Rian Kealey pull him to the ground along the endline. He got up and sprinted out to the ’ and with Dungiven sleeping, took a quick free that left James Brolly with a relatively simple finish from  yards. That levelled it with just four minutes to play. But they couldn’t quite get the score they needed to nose themselves in front. They just didn’t have anything to hold on to. Substitute Fergal McGuigan kicked a  yard free wide and it seemed as though the gods, having rescued Kerry earlier in the day, had dressed themselves in green and gold. But it just had to be Darrell O’Kane’s day. Of all the men in all the world, it just had to be him.

With this in mind, clubs will retain all gate receipts collected from home championship games in . googletag.cmd.push All  senior football teams will be ided into four randomly drawn groups, guaranteeing them three games - home, away and neutral, for a knockout game. Group games will commence on the weekend of August   and placings from the group will dictate pairingsfor the knock-out round set for   September, with the county final to fixed for the weekend of October  . The intermediate football championship will take the format of three groups of four, also randomly drawn. It will commence on the weekend of August  . The top team in each group, and the best runner-up, will go straight to the quarter-finals, with the other eight teams playing off to populate the other four spots. The intermediate final is also planned for the weekend of October  . For the senior and intermediate football championships, the quarter and semi-finals will be based on an open draw, with an effort to avoid repeat pairings in the quarter finals. The junior football championship, also beginning on August  , will take the format of a group of five and a group of four, drawn at random. The top four in each group will make it through to the quarter-finals. The quarter-finals will be v and v, with semi-finals an open draw ahead of a final, which will take place one week later, October  . In hurling, the eight teams will be drawn onto two groups based on the  league placings, which will keep Slaughtneil and Kevin Lynchs apart. The top four teams will play off in the semi-finals, with the beaten semi-finalists playing in the intermediate final. The other four teams from the groups will compete in the junior hurling championship. The hurling championship begins first, on August   with the finals slotted in for September . Teams can start training, under the GAAsto action policy, on July  and Derry CCC must have all their championships complete within a tight -week window before the start of the inter-county season.

Beverly Simpson moved from Guyana in South America to Derry in  to help the ‘failing health system’. She has two sons and a daughter, who was born in Derry. Mrs Simpson was one of the speakers at the Black Lives Matter rally on Saturday in Derrys Guildhall Square. Speaking to the Derry News this week, Beverly said she felt compelled to speak at the event as people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethniccommunities need a ‘safe outlet to express their feelings’. googletag.cmd.push In relation to opposition to the rally taking place, she believes that certain political parties mobilised the PSNI and in doing so ‘aggravated the situation’. Mrs Simpson said she and her daughter Jada were approached by police before reaching the Guildhall and again by three officers while standing there. “The police were intimidating us, she said. It was a safe space, controlled, we had a voice. “I thought, did police officers just see the colour of my skin and approach me. “They weren’t approaching everyone. Like every organisation there’s an element that think they’re superior. “The rally wasn’t even started when we were approached and they didn’t give us the option of going home. googletag.cmd.push “They annoyed us that much it made us more determined to stay.” She added: “They were trying to put a lid on an active volcano, it will still erupt, but instead of erupting in a controlled manner it will erupt all over the place. “Let it be addressed in a controlled environment, in schools or in church. “People should be able to speak about racism, it’s not going away no matter how many lids are put on it.” Since moving to the city, Mrs Simpson claimed that her entire family have been subjected to racism. “All three of my children have experienced racism, including my -year-old,” she said. “In Derry it may be subtle, not open or staring you in the face, but it’s there and unless we actually speak about it, people get away with it and continue to do it. “Don’t get me wrong, you have people everywhere who are good and bad, you have people in Derry who are not racist. “It’s about people’s moral compass, your ethics and what you value. “Children are born innocent and unless you teach them to hate, and teach them racism, they don’t see the person as another colour. “It is something that is learnt and unless we address our own personal prejudices we’ll get nowhere.” From April  to March , there were  racist incidents, resulting in  crimes, in Northern Ireland. Of those,  occurred in the Derry and Strabane policing district, an increase of  on the previous year. It’s understood that many incidents go unreported. For Mrs Simpson’s daughter Jada, race was never an issue until two years ago. Mrs Simpson said her friends at school are all white and ‘she never saw herself as dferent’. However, an incident in  changed her attitude. “She was at the bus station trying to board a bus when the driver shut the door in her face and drove off, leaving her standing there.” Mrs Simpson said that after viewing footage of the incident, the company apologised and the driver was said to have been disciplined. She continued: “It’s there, and unless each company can do like the bus company, address the inidual who is the rotten egg instead of hiding it, and condoning it or trying to cover it up. Address it openly.” Following the incident, the family felt that somebody had listened to them, but Mrs Simpson said a lot of people are afraid to speak out. “Where does that anger go, where does that hurt go, it stays and grows and infiltrates society.” Confirming the incident, a Translink spokesperson stated: “A complaint was received on thSeptember  at Foyle Street bus station. “This was acknowledged, investigated and followed up. “Translink’s Dignity at Work policy, in which all staff are trained on their induction, makes it clear that we are fully committed to creating a harmonious working environment in which all employees are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of race, colour, ethnic or national origins. “This equally applies to how our staff are expected to treat passengers.” In response to criticism that now is not the right time to hold protests, Mrs Simpson said: “Coronavirus is affecting everyone. It’s affecting the Black, Asian and ethnic minority community more. “We’re being marginalised anyway, we’re being segregated anyway, whether by a natural cause or a man-made cause so give us a chance to speak in a safe space.” The level of support on Saturday surprised Mrs Simpson and she said she was ‘proud’ that people ‘challenged themselves’ by turning out.

These exclusive photographs show the special screens which have been erected at Tinneys Bar in Derry. All other pubs are expected to install similar screens between staff and customers as the hospitality sector reopens following the coronavirus lockdown.  A local blinds shop has been assisting Derry bars and businesses as they prepare to reopen safely. Ace Blinds have been operating in the Derry area, serving the community for over five years and employing local people. As businesses adjust to the so-called new normal after lockdown, they have to enforce social distancing and come up with innovative ways to protect their customers. googletag.cmd.push Therefore, Ace Blinds has fitted ‘COVID- roller shields’ in local bars and the orders have been mounting from other businesses in the city. “It has gone a bit crazy at the minute and we have already taken  orders for bars,” says John Kelly of Ace Blinds. It is new territory for Ace Blinds in terms of the material they are using. “The plastic material suits bars great as they can be moved up and down very easily, not like perspex, and they are a lot easier on the eye for customers, so more friendly. They can be attached to suspension ceilings with a special clip so no drillingneeds be. googletag.cmd.push “The material is easily cleaned, you just hold the bottom bar and wipe clean and it can be secured to bars or the groundneeded.” The company has fitted the bathroom at EI Engineering to separate sinks which provides an extra layer of protection for workers. Other businesses in the town have come to them with dferent proposals which they’re working through together. This week, the Economy Minister Dianne Dodds announced that all non-essential goods retailers in Northern Ireland can re-open from tomorrow. Pubs and restaurants are expected to follow suit in July. Confirming the ‘major step forward’, the Minister said: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the local economy. The recovery has already begun and it is time now for the pace to accelerate. The re-opening of all goods retail outlets will be a huge part of this. “The safety of staff and customers is of course paramount. All retailers must be able to implement measures that minimise the risk to their staff and to the people who visit their stores. “We will be co-existing with this virus for some time to come so it is vital that we continue to adhere to guidance to work and live safely.” The Minister added: “The re-opening of our local shopping sector is a signicant step forward in the Executive’s pathway to recovery. I and my Executive colleagues remain committed to moving forward in the recovery while at all times keeping the health, wellbeing and safety of people at the centre and being transparent in our approach.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mitchel was born outside Dungiven, but moved to Newry where he died and had a street, John Mitchel Place, named after him. Former Director of Anti-Slavery International Aidan McQuade has called for the statue to be taken down the street renamed, due to Mitchels support for slavery. “Theyshould have a proper look at who Mitchel was and the things that he said,” McQuade stated in an interview with Newstalk. “Do you want to be honouring that guy with the name that you have ” googletag.cmd.push Glenullin didnt indicateany approach had been made to have clubs name changed, but issued the following statement to the County Derry Post. “The appropriateness or otherwise of the names which were adopted by founding members of our GAA clubs is nothing new. “Any GAA led discussion around the naming or renaming of our clubs, pitches or competitions is welcome, and Glenullin would gladly be a part of any national discussion.” John Mitchels GAC Claudy did confirmed that no approach was made to their club on the subject.

Tucked off the Halfgain road, it is one of Slaughtneils greatest gems. Glenn, who coaches fitness in the wild outdoors with his company Wild Le, was due to celebrate his rd birthday by competing in a half triathlon, before it was cancelled due to the sporting lockdown. “I always try to do something challenging on or around my birthday. I guess it makes me feel alive as my inevitable demise looms ever closer,” Glenn said. It was time to put his creative mind to work and invent a new challenge, something on his doorstep. googletag.cmd.push “I love kettlebells and live in the middle of a nature reserve with loads of footpaths so it meant I could do the challenge without having to travel,” he points out. He has a background in combat sports, primarily Filipino Stick Fighting, is a big lover of tree climbing, cold water wild swimming. “A fellow stick fighter and kettlebell instructor, Dave Hedges, from Dublin completed a mile of swings a few years ago and sowed the seed to do it here.” As part of his challenge he aimed to raise money for local mental health charity, STEPS. After targetting pound as a total, he smashed it and currently has pound, in his Justgiving account. googletag.cmd.push “As someone who has and still does suffer from, at times acute anxiety, raising money for mental health support is a no-brainer,” he explains. “Suicide is the single biggest killer in men under the age of  and the daily number of deaths is going up for both men and women. In Northern Ireland the suicide rate is about double that of England, with almost  percent of our community suffering from mental health issues.” “We are all affected by mental health issues, either directly or indirectly, and its time for it to stop being a taboo subject.” A back injury curtailed Glenns early preparations and he switched rehab mode. His days comprised a series of flexibility routines. “The human body is remarkable at healing and movement is medicine. After a couple of weeks I felt I was good to go, so started doing kettlebell swings daily, building up in volume and then moving onto to the walking swing whereby i take a step forward at the top of each swing.” With over , swings during his iron mile, technique was everything. There was the small matter of managing his hands, such was the wear and tear from the kettlebell. “The kettlebell is constantly moving inside your grip so any hard skin or calluses there tend to rip off,” Glenn outlines. “So I had a weekly routine of filing, shaving and moisturising my hands. They are more rubbery that leathery. “I used a kg kettlebell. This would be fairly light for my average workout but after , swings it felt anything but light. If I do it again i may go up to a kg. The heat was the biggest issue. Within five minutes of his scheduled .am start, he was dripping with sweat. “I was wishing we started two hours earlier, sweat in the eyes and on the palms is less than ideal.” With about  metres to go, Glenn could feel blisters popping on his fingers, but the finish line was in sight. One year older, another challenge met and money raised for a worthwhile cause.

There was substantial damage done to the crop.The farmer continued: ldquoI also had a man who was purposely letting his dog into a field to go to the toilet every morning. This field is used to cut silage for the animals to eat in winter. What these people donrsquot understand is that dog faeces is potentially harmful to cattle.ldquoI appreciate that people like to go for a walk and it is unprecedented times where people are more cautious about meeting people on the roads, but they canrsquot use farmland as recreational ground.ldquoThat is a farmerrsquos work space and every blade of grass is used in farming, eventhere areno cows in the field that they are walking in. The ground is being used for something, be it winter fodder or rotational grazing.ldquoThere are cows calving in my fields and what I am more worried about is that someone is going to get hurt. Cows are extremely volatile around calving season and they will attackthey think their young are in danger.ldquoThe most dangerous animal on a farm is not a bull, itrsquos a newly calved cow. They can and will kill. People think that cows are docile but they can kill.The farmer added: ldquoI am having to look into getting professional CCTV equipment put in place over the land, an expense I could really do without.Mr McGrath said people walking through gated fields, leaving the gates lying open and allowing the livestock to get out placed an ldquounnecessary burden on farmers.ldquoWith some Covid- restrictions being eased itrsquos great to see that people are able to get out and about a bit more whether that be for walking their dogs, going for a longer walk or run or just getting out and about. We need to make full use of our wonderful natural surroundings for our own health and for our own emotional and psychological wellbeing.ldquoHowever, there are issues creeping in regarding walkers and runners using gated fields and pieces of farmland as access points whether for a shortcut or just because they feel they can do this.He continued: ldquoWhen I was growing up in Downpatrick you didnrsquot dare trespass on the land. There was enough respect for the farmer and the great contribution they make to our local communities and as a child probably a healthy level of fear as well.ldquoI want our communities to respect our farmers and to appreciate that they give to the community so much more than they get back.ldquoSoyoursquore out and about and enjoying your walks or runs, please stick to the public roads and public rights of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A walk in the pairc  ","story":"LOCAL GAA clubs are gearing up for ato action.After a three-month lockdown caused by the Covid- pandemic, clubs can look forward to a resumption of gaelic games.Thatrsquos good news for players and spectators, who have been starved of action.The clubs were able to unlock their gates for the first time this week.From Monday they were allowed to open their grounds for small groups of people to use walkways.Non-contact training for club teams will begin on June , initially in groups of no more than ten players with two coaches.Full-contact training can take place from July , with underage games commencing on the same date.

The industry directly employs , people, with thousands more supported in work through the supply chain.The impact of the virus on the sector could be devastating, Baroness Ritchie told peers during a debate on measures needed to repair the UK economy.ldquoProjections indicate that this level of employment could be reduced by  per cent, she said. ldquoThere has been no spend in the tourism industry since March  and it will be late July before tourism outlets open.ldquoMany of those people who will find themselves out of work will have to rely on the benefit system which is already under extreme pressure. It is punitive and needs to be overhauled with the needs of people put at the centre of the debate.She continued: ldquoTo encourage visitors to come to our region to spend money and to invest in our economy, we need to protect our people.ldquoThat means we must ensure our shops are allowed to open subject to social distancing rules and the British Government needs to abolish air passenger duty and reduce VAT on tourism.ldquoThat would assist our hospitality industry and those employed in it as well as the many people who depend on it for their basic source of income. These fiscal measures could indirectly make contributions to reducing inequalities in our society and community. Baroness Ritchie said the furloughing of many staff within the hospitality sector was currently concealing the true extent of the job losses that would follow when the scheme was ended.She also said the pandemic had revealed the ldquodeep levels of poverty and inequalities that are entrenched within many communities.She went on: ldquoThere have been greater levels of dependence on food banks for essential food provisions.

the reinstatement of services at the Downe Hospital.Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Alliance councillor Patrick Brown are both demanding the full restoration of services which were removed at the height of the Covid- pandemic.Baroness Ritchie says she has pressed health chiefs on the issue, but to date has not been given a timeline by the South Eastern Trust.ldquoIt is important that the work on the reinstatement of services and staff continues and that the timeline for doing so is published so that the public is fully aware of all the circumstances, she said.ldquoUndoubtedly, all the staff in the Downe Hospital, including medical, nursing and ancillary, have worked with very dficult challenges over the last few months and they deserve our support, solidarity and congratulations.Baroness Ritchie said she had been told equipment will be ed to the Downe and that the Trust was progressing plans for the rebuilding of non-Covid health and social care services.She said she had pressed senior management on the provision of endoscopy services at the Downe and was informed that the service recommenced in the day procedure unit on June .She said  patients were examined during the first session and that the Trust currently had  patients on their lsquored flag escalation listrsquo for endoscopy services.She said priority was being given to those with higher risk of cancer at this stage. ldquoThese patients are getting access to urgent endoscopy usually within the three-week target, she remarked.She added: ldquoIn response to my query about the scoping work for additional services to be provided at the Downe Hospital, the Trust has informed me that planning for the provision of services to be delivered from the day procedure Unit at the Downe Hospital is part of the overall work the Trust is progressing in relation to the rebuilding of non-Covid  health and social services.ldquoIt is also anticipated that other day case surgical work will recommence shortly afterwards.Cllr Brown called on the Trust to reconsider its decision to engage with a private firm to offer endoscopy treatment at the Downe and to reinstate the AE department, as well as investing in what he said were ldquomuch-needed services for the local community.He claimed privatising healthcare put limits on those who could receive treatment.ldquoOur constituents should have access to high quality local services, he said.ldquoWhilst the dficult and unprecedented circumstances caused by the Covid- pandemic have undoubtedly added a strain on hospital resources, the decision to involve a private contractor for endoscopy treatments should be swtly reconsidered.ldquoInstead, efforts should be made to find a cohesive solution with current medical staff and relevant unions, in order to safeguard our local services.He continued: ldquoThe decision to close the AE Department in Downe Hospital was taken to reallocate resources and staff to other hospitals to help fight Covid-, especially at the peak of the virus.ldquoWhilst it is understandable that medical services needed to adapt as a response to the outbreak, Downe Hospital failed to have a sufficient offering in terms of emergency medical care prior to the pandemic, with an AE Department that only operated for  hours of the day.Cllr Brown said a global health crisis should not be used as an excuse to remove or rationalise health services.He remarked: ldquoDowne Hospital is a vital local employer and necessary for the health and wellbeing of residents across the District.ldquoLocal rural constituents should not have to worry that they wonrsquot have adequate access to healthcare, as services have been displaced to Belfast or Dundonald.ldquoThere is a clear need to invest in services, restoring those lost

It is hard to believe that it has taken  years to get to the stage we are at now at, but the sight of new homes going up is welcome, he continued.ldquoWhile the regeneration of this part of Downpatrick is vital, so is the impact the new homes project will have on addressing a critical shortage of social housing. Many of those in need of a new home are in the urgent need category and the sooner tenants can start to move in, the better.Cllr Curran explained that those in the urgent need category are the priority as far as housing providers are concerned.He also hopes that given the progress that is being made at the former hospital site that families may be able to move in before December.The councillor said the new social housing project will benefit the wider community by providing construction jobs and boosting buildersrsquo suppliers and hopes that those on the waiting list for homes in the town will be offered the new properties.He added: ldquoThis eagerly-awaited scheme is ridding Downpatrick of a derelict site which will be transformed to deliver modern homes in an area of high

initiative aimed at revitalising Ardglass harbour are expected to be published before the end of the month.Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots is due to unveil the first stage of a report from the Fishing and Seafood Development programme whichwill include a timeline for work that needs to be done at Ardglass and the other Co Down ports of Kilkeel and Portavogie.Earlier this year, Mr Poots met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss the future of the village port.They highlighted the importance of the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy and outlined planned improvement work at the harbour, including deepening it to facilitate larger herring and mackerel vessels.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran emphasised the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure, insisting that the port receives its fair share of funding to help enhance the existing fleet.They said that the harbour was ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed in Ardglass.The politicians said additional investment is critical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand with appropriate slipways provided for larger vessels to dock safely.Several weeks after the meeting with Mr Poots it was revealed that ambitious plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.Cllr Curran, who is keen to hear what Mr Poots has to say in a few weeksrsquo time, said there were plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He confirmed that consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a ket part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le.ldquoArdglass lands some of the largest quantities of prawns in Ireland and deepening the harbour will mean that larger fishing vessels that currently dock where, will be able to access local facilities.Cllr Curran also fears that not deepening the harbour could potentially lead to an economic collapse for the Ardglass fishing industry.He added: ldquoI look forward to hear what the fisheries minister has to say towards the end of the month and hope that it will be positively good news for Ardglass..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Roadworks causing delays in town centre  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK businesswoman has called on Phoenix Gas to complete pipe laying work in St Patrickrsquos Avenue by next Monday mdash as promised.The company is investing poundm investment across East Down and to date has laid over  miles of natural gas pipeline, with contractors also currently working in Newcastle.Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents, with work in Downpatrick starting several weeks ago.A mains pipeline has already been laid in a number of areas in the town, with contractors recently completing work in the Edward Street area.

Like the staff who run the facility, I hope that the facility will benefit from a signicant uptake in lsquostaycationsrsquo this summer, he said.Cllr Burgess is also encouraging people across the district who have not yet made their way to the St Patrick Centre to do so during any free time they may have over the summer..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Virtual charity Rock Down concert  ","story":"AN evening of the best of local rock and pop will be hosted on Friday as the Rock Down virtual concert kicks off.Organised by three friends from the Downpatrick and Strangford area ndash Sean Wallace, Harry Deegan, and Patrick Buchanan ndash the event showcasing the best of local talent will raise much-needed funds for mental health charity, Downpatrick PIPS.Donations for the gig have already reached more than pound, and more is likely to come in after the event.Nine acts will perform mostly acoustic sets live via Facebook stream from their own homes or venues ndash suitably socially distanced ndash from pm to pm.Opening up the concert will be Nicky Brown from Ballynahinch and finishing it off will be The Overknights.Other local acts include the Just Adam Band, Petty Youth, The Renegades, Eamon and Charlie Hanlon, Steafan Hanvey and Kevin Young who has just finished off his debut album.

Following a prolonged period of dry weather water levels have dropped to around %. It hasnt been that low since . Picture: Michael CooperSince the beginning of lockdown, the company has seen a signicant rise in the amount of water used in homes.This rise, coupled with the dry weather, has contributed to a drop in water levels in reservoirs.Increased household use has not been offset by the closure of businesses, as many high water users, such as the agri-food sector, factories etc. have been able to stay operational during this time. NI Water Chief Executive Sara Venning said: “This recent dry spell, which has been breaking records, coupled with more people at home using more water, has resulted in a signicant drop in our water levels.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

We would need a period of reasonably wet weather before we would see a signicant change in the levels of most of our reservoirs.“There are a number of steps NI Water can take to alleviate the stress on reservoirs including a hosepipe ban.However, the key to conserving water is public action now.How we all use our water now will have a massive impact on our water levels during the summer months and on whether a hosepipe ban will be required.“For example, we know from the increase in our night usage some customers are leaving sprinklers and hoses on overnight we are appealing to them to stop.A sprinkler left on overnight is enough to meet the daily water needs of  families. We are also asking people to think before they use their pressure washer. Could the task be put off until we are out of this dry period  “However, the easiest way for everyone to save a little water and make a big dference is through normal household tasks.If each of us turned off the tap when brushing our teeth, in a month we would save enough water for the daily handwashing of  people.  “Similarly,you put a jug of water into the fridge rather than running the tap, those actions alone would save approximately  litres per day.This is enough to keep  people hydrated for a whole day! “We want everyone to enjoy their home and garden, we just need people to think about how they use their water andwhat they are doing is essential.If it is not essential we would really appeal to people not do it at the moment.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

At that stage we had no clue how long lockdown would go on for.“The past few months have been challenging and very dficult.“The kids and I would normally see mum several times during the week or they would go over to hers for their tea at the weekend and she would help out with childcare.”Ms Benson says while the family embraced technology for keeping in touch, nothing beats seeing each other in real le.“We got mum on to WhatsApp so we would all be sending each other videos and photos and doing group calls.“She would struggle with technology a bit so it was challenging but we made the most of it.“The kids would give her a WhatsApp call at night so she could say goodnight to them – it was a way of staying connected but it was tough.”Ms Benson says she was overjoyed when she found out about the easing of restrictions.“For me it was just such a sense of relief that the loneliness would end and she could touch her grandchildren.”For the past few weeks, Ms Hamilton had been collecting up Ikea boxes for the children to play with and planting peas and new herbs in her beloved garden.“Mum would say the days dragged into each other but Sunday was the worst.“She usually would have gone to church, then spent the day making Sunday dinner.“Three months of sitting on your own and having meals on your own is just so tough and isolating.“She said that was the most challenging thing for people living on their own.”Looking ahead, Ms Benson says lockdown has given her family a new-found appreciation for the little things in le.“We’re just looking forward to spending normal time as a family and going on wee day trips and doing all the kinds of things we took for granted before this.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues

new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become

including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

stationrsquos Facebook followers are invited to a live online QA session.It is hoped that people will be able to share their memories of the leboat and the contribution that the station has made to the local community.Additional events to mark the history of the leboat in Penarth will be promoted throughout the year once lockdown eases.MORE STORIESPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught

soon a better lsquostationrsquo was developed in the deckchair storebefore moving to its current home, a purpose built station opened in .Gareth Wigmore, one of the first crew members in  and now station president said the leboat was pushed by the crew along the seafront, which at the time wasnrsquot even one way.ldquoWe were as keen as mustard, pleased to be doing our bit for the community, but we had rudimentary equipment back then, he said.ldquoSome of our protective equipment was made by the local community.Crew member Karl Lawrence, with  yearsrsquo experience with the RNLI, said: ldquoThe best part of le-boating is working well as a team.ldquoWe maintain this team spirit by regularly exercising and training both ashore and afloat.ldquoSince opening our new station at the south end of the Esplanade we have installed a training room which is ideal for providing training in a warm, well-lit and stable room, prior to practicing on often rough seas in the leboats.ldquoMy favourite rsquoshoutsrsquo are oddly those which occur in the early hours of the morning on a spring day.ldquoBy the time the job has been completed and the boats are washed down and prepared again for service, we gather on our balcony drinking tea or coffee, watching the sun rise and exchanging with each other our plans for the day ahead, before most other people have woken up.Celebrating the success of the station, current leboat operations manager, Jason Dunlop said ldquoI am incredibly proud to celebrate the stationrsquos -year anniversary.ldquoIt is testament to the community of Penarth who have supported the leboats by providing volunteers, funds, and ongoing support.ldquoThis community effort over the past  years has saved  lives, we have rescued or aided  people and our leboats have launched on service  times.ldquoHundreds of volunteers have supported the RNLI and the station in this time.ldquoI would like to express my thanks to them all and their families.He added: ldquoIt makes no dferencethe role people have played is to crew the boats, to assist launch on shore, provide community safety advice, run our shops or fundraise, everyone plays a vital role in saving lives.ldquoThe RNLI is funded by donations and receives no government funding, soyou are a fundraiser, a member of our shop team, a local business who supports us or a member of the community who has donated or raised funds you have help us to save lives.ldquoWe are all one leboat crew and we are part of the community of Penarth.ldquoThe RNLI is built of the vision that ldquowith courage, nothing

A wide range of services were stood down or scaled back due to the risk of spread of COVID-. New services were introduced to meet the predicted demands of the pandemic. A spokesperson said: With the first peak of the COVID- outbreak in Northern Ireland having passed, the Trust is now focused on planning, with our HSC partners, how to restart services while maintaining sufficient flexibility so that services can respond to future waves of this disease. In working together with our health and social care partners across NI to implement the recovery of non-COVID- HSC Services, the agreed regional approach will be to ensure equity of access to treatment for patients and clients across NI, to minimise transmission of COVID- and to protect the most urgent services. A set of guiding principles in the form of a ‘checklist’ has been established by the Department of Healthto guide service planning. The DoH has asked that service restart plans be assessed against the checklist to ensure that they have been subject to a rigorous risk assessment, take account of new ways of working and can be safely implemented in line with social distancing, use of personal protective equipmentand infection prevention and control requirements.The Western Trust has introduced a Reset Framework to support staff in assessing the impact of scaling up or restarting services and to ensure there is a rigorous and careful approach to planning.A spokesperson continued: The Western Trust Stage  Plan identies the services we have maintained throughout these initial months of the COVID- pandemic across a wide range of areas. It identies those that we will continue and others that we will begin to restart or scale up. It sets out some of the important preparation work needed to provide COVID- safe environments and working practices, to protect our staff, patients and service users. There are a number of constraints which are foremost in the planning process, including availability of PPE availability of drugs and restrictions on the practice of vulnerable staff.Our Stage  plan will focus on:Supporting strong community services for frail or older people. Preparing for the impact of the COVID- pandemic on mental health services. Managing risk, and providing COVID--safe services for staff and our service users. Involving our staff and service users.Speaking about the launch of Stage  of the Trust’s Reset Plan, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Western Trust chief executive, said: “There is no doubt that this has been one of the most dficult periods we have ever had to experience.I would like to thank our community and hospital staff for their hard work and dedication. Members of the public have also been unwavering in their support and this has not gone unnoticed. “There are many challenges which we have faced and will continue to face in the new COVID- environment. Our Stage  plan sets out the steps we are taking to rebuild, reset and make necessary changes to our services into the future.“It is accepted that COVID- remains a public health risk to our population and a phased and flexible approach is needed to restarting services. As a result, the way services are delivered may look and feel dferent. There are opportunities to do things dferently in ways that improve care. Many great initiatives have already begun.” Dr Kilgallen continued: “While there are signicant challenges ahead, the public should be reassured that we are committed to providing the best possible care in environments that reduce the risk of infection for staff and services users alike. We will continue to work diligently to create COVID--safe environments while we rebuild services.” A copy of the rebuilding plan – Stage One can you be found on the Trust website www.westerntrust.hscni.net  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dbacceaecae   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ddceebfced   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
