Now, with a global pandemic, and the country on lockdown, it’s an arguably perfect time to look back on some of her drawings, which capture the poetry of solitude.To celebrate her work, New York gallery Hauser \u0026amp Wirth has launched their first online exhibition, Louise Bourgeois: Drawings, 1947 – 2007, showcasing 14 drawings from the artist’s long career, which ned seven decades. They’re calling it an online exhibit presentation and the drawings are featured alongside a short documentary of the artist in her studio.“It’s a response to the current situation, in the sense that we’re all glued to our devices,” said Marc Payot, president of Hauser \u0026amp Wirth. “Obviously, we’re not capable of going out into museums and galleries, but we’re still interested in art. This is a possibility to share that.”The drawings on view range from abstract landscapes to strange swirls, black holes and a pair of eyes gazing back at the viewer. There’s a pink butterfly, grass-strewn landscapes and one that simply says: I Love You.“With drawing, she was capable of dealing with her anxieties,” said Payot. “To some extent, it has a nice parallel in what we’re all going through, collectively and inidually. This selection of drawings is a great mirror for our current day-to-day.”There’s one piece from 1986 called Spit or Star, which depicts two pairs of scissors, large and small, referencing her own family history in the French tapestry business. Often, her reference to the tools of the trade are connected to emotional repair, rebuilding and self-healing.“Scissors are an aggressive tool of cutting, but they were also a familiar, tender thing with her family business,” said Payot. “It’s both.”There’s also a red and blue landscape, Untitled, from 1970, which calls to mind the curves of a woman’s body. “That’s something repeating throughout her oeuvre, the body,” said Payot. “This piece is 50 years old, but looks like something out of a young artist’s studio from Brooklyn.”Bourgeois, who was born in 1911 in Paris, started drawing as a child, and helped her parents through the day-to-day of their tapestry business, drawing templates for torn fabrics that needed repairing. Later, after becoming an artist in her own right, her drawings became the starting point for her larger artworks, like her steel and bronze sculptures. But her drawings were also a daily meditation.“The drawings really had a healing effect, as she was overcoming pain and anxiety through her drawing,” said Payot. “We all need this, these days.”Though she had her first solo show in 1945 at the Bertha Schaefer Gallery in New York, it wasn’t until the Museum of Modern Art gave Bourgeois a retrospective in 1982, when she was already 70, that she took the art world by storm, riding the wave as a global art star until her passing in 2010.Drawings were a daily ritual of the artist, and she used ink, watercolor and pencil to record her thoughts through images and words. “I need to make things,” she once said. “The physical interaction with the medium has a curative effect. I need the physical acting out. I need to have these objects exist in relation to my body.”In the gallery’s short video (which could very well be the start of a feature documentary), Bourgeois explains: “My childhood has never lost its mystery, it has never lost its magic and it has never lost its drama.”Fade to black.“In this video clip, Louise speaks about the importance of drawing to her, it’s very touching,” said Payot. “When you do an exhibition online, it can’t just be a couple of images, we needed to add more. It’s the only way to see art now because you can’t go anywhere. For us, it’s a challenge but we’re working with that dilemma.”Bourgeois is known for her giant spider sculptures but has also been called the reluctant hero of feminist art, for taking on the patriarchy, having lived through two world wars and making artwork about motherhood, rather than showing women as naked muses to male artistsThe main theme in her work is overcoming the trauma of her childhood, though she didn’t always explain herself. She did once say, however: “To be an artist, you need to exist in a world of silence.” Blocking out the busy New York art world was something she was an expert at. Loneliness didn’t seem to faze her.Payot said that she hosted social gatherings for artists in her studio, where they’d discuss artworks, like an old school Parisian salon. Bourgeois would often criticize other artists and their artworks. “That was her way to communicate and be in touch with the world,” he said. “But most of the time, she was isolated, interested in her work and not anything else.”Though Bourgeois made much of her artwork about her childhood trauma and the complicated relationship between her mother and father, she also made artwork about the years her mother was critically ill from influenza and Bourgeois took care of her (sadly, her mother Joséphine passed away when her daughter was just 22).Drawings were essential to her artistic process. They were often the start to her paintings and prints, even after she turned to sculpture in the 1940s. Some of these works, too, started as drawings. Her most well-known pieces, themed around a spider motif, started out as an ink and charcoal drawing in 1947.Though she kept a written diary and a spoken diary (where she recorded her voice onto a tape recorder), her drawn diary was the most important to her. “Having these diaries means that I keep my house in order,” she once said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/232739b07c190d31462cfd6999f1781b10d8d3c9/0_372_6484_3887/master/6484..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=470b99f8306c1b8517902b0d9b90680e","title":"a glimpse of something wonderful great pivotal moments in pictures magnum photographers","story":"A kiss by the sea, a disco in Wolverhampton, the shoot that made Marilyn Monroe ... ‘turning point’ images by Magnum photographers are being sold for $100 apiece to aid Covid-19 relief"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ed20f2a5fab3c65d8b31ea6db633b097ea72e07/293_881_4483_2691/master/4483.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b37413a09fd7cd35225153979bf2c88","title":"young adult books round up review","story":"A dark detective adventure, a prophetic dragon and a prison breakout lead this spring’s treats for teen readersHolly Jackson’s A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder was last year’s big breakout debut, introducing schoolgirl turned detective Pippa Fitz-Amobi. The sequel, Good Girl, Bad Blood (Electric Monkey, £7.99, May), is set one year later. Pippa and Ravi Singh have released a true crime podcast about the murder and are insistent their detecting days are behind them – until a local boy goes missing. Jackson ensnares readers in another highly addictive web, woven from the dark shadows of small-town secrets.More mystery from Akala, the Bafta-winning musician and founder of the Hip-Hop Shakespeare Company, in The Dark Lady (Hachette, £12.99). In the brutal streets of Elizabethan London, Henry is a brown-skinned boy thief in the Devil’s Gap, the city’s most notorious slum. He survives on his wits and tough moral choices, and an exceptional secret gift. Themes of race, class and identity, familiar from Akala’s bestselling adult book Natives, are driven by powerful prose in an exhilarating, magic-laced adventure.With two Carnegie medals to his name, Patrick Ness is a literary giant in young adult fiction, and his books remain gloriously original and unpredictable. His latest, Burn (Walker, £12.99, May), is set in an alternative 1950s America, where Sarah and her father reluctantly hire a dragon to work on their farm. The dragon, Kazimir, comes not with farmwork on his mind but a world-changing prophecy. What follows is a wild ride of fanaticism, redemption, assassins and dragon-worshippers. Mind-bending in the best possible way.Dystopian fiction may cut too close to the bone for some in 2020, but the genre is seeing a resurgence. Fans of The Hunger Games and Maze Runner should look no further than Ben Oliver’s The Loop (Chicken House, £7.99) for their next fix. In a near-future world, 16-year-old Luka Kane is on death row in a high-tech prison controlled by artificial intelligence, where inmates can delay their execution by submitting to medical experiments. Rumours of a war kickstart an adrenaline-fuelled breakout. Thrilling and terrifying in equal measure.Jacqueline Wilson first wrote for young teenagers in the Girls in Love series. Now, in Love Frankie (Doubleday, £12.99), 13-year-old Frankie is dealing with her mum’s multiple sclerosis and navigating her new feelings for a girl in her class. All the exhilaration and confusion of first love is here, full of tender, awkward truths. Wilson’s books – addressing topics such as orce, mental health and living in care – have been subject to much hand-wringing over the years, but nobody chronicles the messy complexity of modern girlhood in quite the same way.Finally, goodness knows teenagers need some laughter in these strange times, and Pretty Funny by Rebecca Elliott (Penguin, £7.99) promises to be a balm. Our heroine Haylah, a self-styled “Big Funny Girl”, juggles her chaotic home life with dating dilemmas, body positivity and her dream of becoming a comedian.

With broadcasters and politicians addressing the nation from their own front rooms, it has become easier than ever. Now we don’t even have to go to someone’s home (fortunate in these times) to judge them by their reading habits. Now the libraries of the famous are laid bare for us all to mock or admire.What does it tell us about Boris Johnson, for example, that he has a collection of big, gold-lettered, red-spined hardbacks that look as if they’ve come straight from the fabled library of Alexandria? Or that Prince Charles keeps a hefty Dick Francis close at hand? MSNBC’s Kasie Hunt and the Washington Post’s White House reporter Seung Min Kim both arrange their books by colour, it seems. Joe Wicks has beautiful shelves with … no books on them. And a screenshot of the “first ever digital cabinet”, shared by the PM, suggests that Jacob Rees-Mogg has one of those dream libraries with dark wood shelves and ladders on wheels.Of course, broadcasters know that bookshelves say a lot about a person, and some have been cheating. Fox News correspondent Brandi Kruse, for example, tweeted: “Reporters, experts, pundits working from home in front of bookshelves: what is ONE book you removed from your shelf because you didn’t want people to see it. Don’t lie you, know you did. Mine: 365 Ways to Drive a Liberal Crazy (no memory of how it came to be in my possession).” Cynical viewers will obviously allege that some people have deliberately scratched together a pile of books to pose against, while book lovers assume it would be impossible to find a camera angle in any reasonable person’s home that doesn’t reveal a healthy lockdown reading pile.Here are some of the most interesting bookshelves in the homes of the commentariat. But are they intellectual poseurs or lifelong readers?The Channel 4 news anchor set the tone for broadcasting from home with his smart grey suits and well-stocked bookshelves. Snow’s bottom shelf is clearly the art section, with books about Andy Warhol, Aubrey Beardsley, Aristide Maillol, Brâncuşi, Caravaggio and Utagawa Kuniyoshi. There’s an eclectic music shelf, including Catch a Fire: The Life of Bob Marley by Timothy White and Gil Scott-Heron’s memoir The Last Holiday. But Snow is also perhaps following advice to keep healthy and exercise the brain, with Treasures of British History – by his cousin Peter and his son Dan Snow – and The Clever Guts Diet Recipe Book by Dr Clare Bailey.The foreign secretary, on the other hand, appears to have hastily assembled a book collection shortly before appearing on BBC News. Standing in front of a windowsill, he posed with a pile of brand-new-looking books on either side of his head. They included biographies of Richard Nixon and Arnold Schwarzenegger, a book about economics from the Economist, and Niall Ferguson’s Virtual History, which asks questions such as: “What if Britain had stayed out of the first world war? What if Germany had won the second?” What if Raab had already read that book on economics before we got into this mess, we all wondered.“Kate Middleton shows off her incredible book collection in rare picture taken inside her Kensington Palace home,” promised Hello! magazine in a headline guaranteed to excite nosy book lovers. Alas, the photos showed the Duchess of Cambridge with a row of elegant clothbound Penguin Classics that are beautiful, if not as special as “incredible” might suggest. The Duchess is said to enjoy contemporary thrillers such as The Girl on the Train, but this collection is much more canonical. It includes Sense and Sensibility and Mansfield Park by Jane Austen, The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde and Middlemarch by George Eliot.A lockdown is always a good time for a conspiracy theory, and Sturgeon’s bookshelves inspired a great one. The Scottish first minister is known to be a book lover, and her collection shows that she is a loyal supporter of Scottish writers. But why, some asked, were her shelves almost entirely full of Ian Rankins in one interview, and then packed with Val McDermids in another on the same day? Was it something Rankin had said about independence that prompted a cull? Probably not a closer look shows that Sturgeon had just shuffled her chair one bookcase along.Dishy Rishi can’t seem to put a foot wrong at the moment, starting with his “kiss of life” budget and climaxing with this working-from-home photo. His housebound admirers swooned over his cosy hoodie, his two screens and his excellent bookshelves. The chancellor scores points for authenticity – this is no last-minute book grab to look clever, but the study of our dreams, including a row of Penguin Popular Classics, which were phased out in 2013. Perhaps he could lend some to his colleague Raab?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/248090e0ff81ac29b54f450f3dc33a46ea262628/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e328990e224d77329692ac5acf3d2f3c","title":"easyjet secures 600m coronavirus loan from uk treasury and bank","story":"Airline also plans to borrow £400m from creditors to ensure liquidity during shutdownEasyJet has secured a £600m loan from the Treasury and Bank of England’s emergency coronavirus fund, as the airline’s founder and biggest shareholder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, claimed it would run out of cash by the year end regardless.The airline said it would also borrow another $500m (£407m) from commercial creditors to ensure its liquidity, with its fleet grounded for at least April and May due to the pandemic.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.Britain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.The announcement came as Haji-Ioannou, who with his family owns just over a third of easyJet shares, demanded an emergency general meeting and called for the sacking of two directors.The Cypriot tycoon relaunched his attack on the airline’s management and its order for 107 “useless” planes from Airbus, saying his “main objective is to terminate the £4.5bn Airbus contract”.In a statement issued before confirmation of easyJet’s government loan, Haji-Ioannou had claimed that even remaining solvent until August – based on financial analysis that assumed flying would be quickly embraced again by holidaymakers this summer – could prove “wildly optimistic”.When international travel eventually restarts, he said, the airline would “feel more like a startup trying to find a few profitable routes for a few aircraft”.After news of the new financing, a spokesman for Haji-Iannaou said that it did not change the underlying situation, without cancellation of the Airbus order: “Given the current cash burn – that probably pushes the insolvency boundary back from August to late-autumn, early winter.”EasyJet is understood to be in talks with Airbus to review the £4.5bn contract and reduce its ongoing spend.The chief executive of easyJet, Johan Lundgren, said: “We remain absolutely focused on ensuring the long-term future of the airline, reducing our costs and preserving jobs, to make sure easyJet is in the best position to resume flying once the pandemic is over.”He said the airline had now reached agreements with unions to furlough UK-based pilots and crew. About 4,000 of 9,000 will be furloughed during April and May.Lundgren added: “Our current priority is to safeguard short-term liquidity … in the event of a prolonged grounding of the fleet.”EasyJet has used the government’s Covid-19 corporate financing facility, which allows UK businesses to apply for loans at pre-crisis commercial rates.The aviation sector had called for special government measures to help it survive, but the Treasury has been unwilling to assist airlines until wealthy shareholders dig deep.The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said he would consider companies on a case-by-case basis, “only if all commercial avenues have been explored, including raising capital from existing investors”.However, Haji-Ioannou, whose family received a near £60m share of £171m paid in idends last month, said: “For the avoidance of doubt, I will not inject any fresh equity in easyJet whilst the Airbus liability is in place.”EasyJet is likely to explore ways of resisting his calls for an emergency meeting, which it said would be “an unhelpful distraction”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef901ffd7d02877e21a9abfa2f48805a60d19cf5/7_38_2071_1243/master/2071..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8de5845bbfbc8f681b19cae7aa7f7d49","title":"world must combat looming debt meltdown in developing countries covid 19","story":"If international community wants to avoid wave of Covid-19 defaults it needs to start rescue plan As it spread from one country to another, the coronavirus paid no attention to national frontiers or “big, beautiful” border walls. Nor were the ensuing economic effects contained. As has been obvious since the outset, the Covid-19 pandemic is a global problem that demands a global solution.In the world’s advanced economies, compassion should be sufficient motivation to support a multilateral response. But global action is also a matter of self-interest. As long as the pandemic is still raging anywhere, it will pose a threat – both epidemiological and economic – everywhere.The impact of Covid-19 on developing and emerging economies has only begun to reveal itself. There are good reasons to believe that these countries will be ravaged far more by the pandemic than the advanced economies have been. After all, people in lower-income countries tend to live in closer proximity to one another. A higher share of the population suffers from pre-existing health problems that render them more vulnerable to the disease. And these countries’ health systems are even less prepared to manage an epidemic than those of the advanced economies (which have hardly functioned smoothly).A 30 March report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development offers an early glimpse of what lies in store for emerging and developing economies. The most successful of them rely on export-led growth, which will now collapse as the global economy contracts. Not surprisingly, global investment flows are also plummeting, as are commodity prices, indicating a tough road ahead for natural-resource exporters.These developments are already being reflected in the yield spreads on developing countries’ sovereign debt. Many governments will find it exceedingly difficult to roll over the debts coming due this year on reasonable terms, if at all.First, full use must be made of the International Monetary Fund’s special drawing rights, a form of “global money” that the institution was authorised to create at its founding. The SDR is an essential ingredient in the international monetary order that John Maynard Keynes advocated during the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944. The idea is that, because all countries will obviously want to protect their own citizens and economies during crises, the international community should have a tool for assisting the neediest countries without requiring national budgets to take a hit.It is also crucial that creditor countries help by announcing a stay on developing and emerging economies’ debt service. To understand why this is so important, consider the US economy. Last month the US Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that there would be no foreclosures on federally insured mortgages for 60 days. In essence, this policy is part of a broader “stay” on the entire US economy as a response to the Covid-19 crisis. Workers are staying home, restaurants are staying closed and airlines are all but shut down. Why should creditors be allowed to continue racking up returns, especially when the interest rates they charge should have already created a sufficient risk cushion? Unless creditors grant such a stay, many debtors will emerge from the crisis owing more than they can possibly repay.Such stays are just as important internationally as they are domestically. Under current conditions, many countries simply cannot service their debts, which, in the absence of a global stay on repayment, could lead to massive, rolling defaults. In many developing and emerging economies, the government’s only choice is either to funnel more income to foreign creditors or allow more of its citizens to die. Obviously, the latter will be unacceptable to most countries, so the real choice for the international community, then, is between an orderly or a disorderly stay, with the latter scenario inevitably resulting in severe turbulence and far-reaching costs to the global economy.Of course, it would be even better if we had an institutionalised mechanism for restructuring sovereign debt. The international community tried to achieve that in 2015, when the United Nations general assembly adopted a set of shared principles with overwhelming support. Unfortunately, that framework lacked the necessary buy-in from key creditor countries. It is probably too late to establish such a system now for use in the current crisis. But there will inevitably be more crises down the line, which means that sovereign-debt restructuring should be high on the agenda for the post-pandemic reckoning.In John Donne’s immortal words, “No man is an island … ” Nor is any country – as the Covid-19 crisis has made abundantly clear. If only the international community would get its head out of the sand.• Joseph E Stiglitz is a Nobel laureate in economics, university professor at Columbia University and chief economist at the Roosevelt Institute."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75b14ea76f2125954828e64961d22e29b63326a9/0_207_3072_1843/master/3072..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a382635b55cad1fe33973a1c6bb16e21","title":"the guardian view on a lockdown exit strategy get plans in place","story":"Britons will need to stay at home for weeks to come. But the public must soon be given an idea of what the next phase will look likeLike pacesetters in a deadly long-distance race, Italy and Spain have for weeks charted new and frightening territory, as the coronavirus pandemic grips Europe. Citizens have watched in anguish, as daily death tolls climbed close to a thousand and hospitals were overwhelmed. At the weekend, nearly a month after Rome and Madrid imposed national lockdowns, the first glimmerings of a reward for an unprecedented period of collective self-restraint were visible. In Italy, Sunday’s reported death toll of 525 was the smallest daily increase since 19 March, and the number of people requiring hospital treatment also fell. In Spain, the growth rate of the number of infections was the lowest since the pandemic began.The uplifting data appears to confirm the positive impact of effective physical distancing on the virus’s spread. Italy’s health minister, Roberto Speranza, is expected to extend the country’s lockdown well beyond its current end date of 13 April, and the government will wait to see the downward trends maintained over a number of days. In Spain, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has already extended the shutdown until 26 April. But the welcome flattening of those dismal curves creates dilemmas and quandaries that are no less daunting for being the result of good news.As Spanish and Italian citizens desperately seek some respite and the spectre of the deepest global recession since the 1930s looms, their politicians’ thoughts are turning to how to manage a loosening of restrictions on people and business, while minimisingthe risk of triggering a second deadly wave.The task, as Mr Speranza says, is to work out a way “to live with the virus” until a vaccine is discovered. Mr Sánchez has indicated that a ban on all non-essential work will be lifted after Easter. Other European countries, including France and Austria, where some shops will reopen next week, have also begun to game-plan the second phase of the crisis. The modus vivendi will, if it is to work, involve continued physical distancing, much greater testing and contact tracing in the community, and a functioning antibody test to establish who has had and recovered from the disease. The French prime minister, Édouard Philippe, has emphasised that any easing of the lockdown in France will be “fearsomely complex” and is not likely to happen “in one move everywhere and for everyone”. The politics of easing lockdown will be as fraught and treacherous as imposing it in the first place.As the death rate here continues to rise steeply, ministers are, rightly, preoccupied with reinforcing one stark message: a rigorously observed lockdown for an extended period to come is the only way to save thousands of lives that would otherwise be lost. But as other countries begin to unveil looser measures, the pressure on the government to reveal its own eventual exit strategy will be intense. It must do the necessary groundwork now.The challenges will be multiple: in Germany, scientists have estimated that the current level of 50,000 tests a day – compared with around 10,000 in Britain – would be insufficient to allow even a partial end to lockdown. A system of effective contact tracing will need to be devised. Certain sections of the population will need to be told that they must continue to stay at home. Particular types of businesses may need to be prioritised at the expense of others. In March, the British government was badly behind the curve when it came to moving to a form of lockdown. If it is to maintain the confidence and cooperation of the public in staying at home, it will soon need to offer a credible account of what comes next."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eb8f05a33d22a1173b15d29815f80d6acce90c7/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89f5966de119c51ecdb34280b0f322a2","title":"coronavirus celebrity influence criticism","story":"With no red carpet premieres or awards shows, the only stars being clapped for are healthcare workers every evening as people rely on each other for unityWe Are the World.

Unfortunately for those with blue checkmarks on Twitter and Instagram, the era of star-studded thoughts and prayers appears to be over.When Elton John and some of biggest musicians in the world livestreamed a Covid-19 benefit concert in front of 8 million, the other 7.45 billion captive viewers opted out.The celebrity tune-out continued on social media.Wonder Woman Gal Gadot and her gang of fellow actors inspired a thousandfold more criticism and cringe than goodwill for their atonal rendition of John Lennon’s unifying-with-no-heaven manifesto Imagine.Vanessa Hudgens quashed any hope for a celebrity epidemiologist to emerge when she wokefully expressed to her fans: “Even if everybody gets it, like yeah, people are going to die, which is terrible … but inevitable?”When tips on maintaining physically safe-distanced fitness routines from their indoor pools and remote personal trainers on video chat failed to save the world, the cultural elite wised up to content people were actually seeking.Through multiple failed attempts at prying relevance from the vice grip of a global pandemic, the celebrity industrial complex quickly pivoted its outreach strategy from unification and togetherness to one of cautious utility and ominous warning.Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Samuel L Jackson and even David Letterman popped out of the coffin to echo World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warnings about maintaining social distance and “staying the fuck at home” with cute songs and selfies.Driven by a narcissistic and possibly sociopathic desire to parent, what happens when no one listens to the celebrities that know best during a time of crisis? If the rich and famous are unable to guide our moral compass, who serves as the magnetic north?To date, not one star has been able to approach the meteoric Covid-19 stardom of Dr Anthony Fauci, longtime US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director. Fauci’s press conferences and messaging have inspired trending hashtags, fan pages, memes and even bobbleheads and prayer candles. Holding his role since 1984, Fauci never had any cause to become a household name, until now.Some of the best creative inspiration in history has come from those not born into the monopoly of creativity. Fauci, Governors Andrew Cuomo of New York and Gavin Newsom of California, and even polarizing Donald Trump have captured the nation’s attention with their regular public responses and working solutions to the coronavirus crisis.Where government officials and doctors are now the celebrated authorities for news and knowledge, people stuck at home are finally relying on each other for unity and entertainment. Happy hours are taking place between friends who may have never been able to grab a drink together in real life, while an entire cottage industry of backgrounds for the video chat platform Zoom has popped up.The meme-makers on Reddit and lip-syncing dancers on TikTok are getting the nation to connect and pay attention with their daily challenges, pranks and heartfelt safety warnings. They’ve turned Covid-19 into the great equalizer, proving that it takes a good thought to have influence, not the other way around.With no red carpet premieres or glamorous awards shows, the only stars being clapped for are healthcare workers every evening at 7pm. When Tom Hanks revealed he had coronavirus, we realized celebrities really are just like us. And that’s what’s disappointing.It might be a reflection of not only the pandemic, but of the times in general, that celebrity influence is waning. Sure, the K-pop supergroup BTS routinely induces fans into fainting across the globe, but we will probably never have another king of pop who can rally the entire planet into caring and taking action.Thirty-five years after We Are the World, we’re left to wonder, who actually was the we?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16bf7d3dc406c7d810dfa2794f1fd629e31f1421/0_0_7195_4316/master/7195..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61a66768c5a1e162c1e8552790d6a5b7","title":"in these scary times a hug would help but its the one thing i cannot have","story":"There’s never been more ways to connect with the people you love. But it’s not enough. Because the thing that is missing is touchThe last few weeks, I’ve been thinking a lot about different types of physical touch. Unfortunately, that is a sentence that is always going to sound inherently creepy, but I think I can get away with it, considering current circumstances. I’ve been thinking about the time at Mardi Gras a mere month ago when four of my friends attacked me with hugs and kisses, completely enveloping me in a storm of affection. Thinking about my Nanna grabbing my hand as we walk together, her laughing and clutching my arm as I attempt to convince her to try a burrito (which she refuses because she’s too white and afraid of flavour). Remembering the countless small touches with past lovers, like resting my hand on their thigh as we watch TV, or rolling over in bed at night, and having them move to spoon me instinctively.For a very, very long time, as a fat closeted youth, I shunned affection and hugging. When people wanted to hug me, I would tense up and make it an unpleasant experience for all parties. I felt so insecure in my physical body, that to let someone embrace me would make me feel ashamed. And I felt so scared and uncomfortable in my mind, and I could never let myself be vulnerable, or get close to other people physically. That all changed when later in life, I found my community and began to love myself. I am now what you would call, a “hug slut” (can I say slut in the ? Who knows, it’s a pandemic). The older I’ve gotten, the more I’ve relied on physical affection from other people, especially friends. They are a constant those you know will always be there to give you a hug when you are going through a hard time. Except for now, in this very specific hard time, when it could be used the most.Almost everyone’s lives have suffered a sudden dramatic change. With the lockdown laws meaning you’re stuck indefinitely with whoever you happen to be living with, it’s sparked a conversation about which way of life would suck the most right now. Obviously the real answer to this is that it continues to suck the most for people it’s always sucked for – imprisoned refugees, prisoners, homeless people, the chronically ill, the elderly, people with disabilities, those in unsafe relationships, and all the other marginalised groups we’ve ignored.But a lot of the general public will now be struggling in ways they haven’t before, and we will all be facing our own challenges. For example, parents having to keep their children inside and entertained 24 hours a day while still working seems like a literal nightmare. The part I am struggling most with in my inidual circumstance is the sudden and complete loss of affection. I’m anxious about other things, like losing work, but still at the forefront of my mind every day is that I can’t be touched by, or touch another human, for god knows how long. (Again, creepy but justified.) When there isn’t a pandemic on, being alone is great. I spend time socialising, seeing friends, dating, being affectionate, and I am fulfilled and sustained. Suddenly, with all that gone, everything else seems harder to cope with.Luckily, I am a very “online” person, and I am using the privilege of having the internet to its fullest extent. I am actually in contact more with people now per day than I would be usually. There’s texting, chatting, watching movies together, video calling, apps where you chat with whoever is around. But socially I am often switching between two kinds of people – there’s those who are in lockdown with friends or family or lovers, and those interactions make my desire for that even more acute. Or I am talking to other people in the same situation as me, and the almost-but-not-quite being present with each other leaves a hollow feeling when you close out of the chat window to sit alone again. The silence in the few seconds when you hang up, either way, is deafening. There’s never been more ways to connect with the people you love. But it’s not the same, and it’s not enough. Because the thing that is missing is touch.Seeing someone through a screen will never be the same as hugging hello. Human beings need touch to thrive. We need affection. We need skin contact. These are not the hippy feelings of a lesbian alone in her room for too long, this is actually science. When everything else in the world is scary like right now, the one thing that might help is being embraced by someone I love, and it’s the only thing I cannot have. It’s obviously not the most pressing issue facing us, but not knowing how long it will be until I can feel someone wrap their arms around me again fills me with dread. But I also know I’m privileged to have that be something I miss, and something I know I can look forward to on the other side of this. And I’ll never take it for granted again.• Rebecca Shaw is a writer based in Sydney• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

People work in them because they have a passion, but also because there is no alternative, and they do so on all our behalves.Prison officers have always been the unsung heroes of public duty: never quite macho enough for the people who glorify the armed forces always a bit too authoritarian for those who valorise nurses. They are some of the most inventive and diligent people working anywhere in the business of caring for others, but they have generally done so without much credit.This crisis is forcing an urgent re-evaluation of that, along with all those other jobs that were previously classed as low-value yet now turn out to be the most important in the country. Words are not enough, and nor is clapping you can praise care workers to the skies, but if you’re paying them the minimum amount in 15-minute segments, without security of hours or of employment, without sick or holiday pay, then the praise is hollow.You can wax sentimental about the holy vocation of nursing, but you cannot then bring second-year students on to the frontline to fight coronavirus and still expect them to pay their tuition fees. You cannot claim, as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, told Andrew Marr on Sunday, that this isn’t the right time to talk about pay rises it is the best and only time to talk about pay rises, when we have finally realised, with a jolt, just how much we rely on people who put their jobs ahead of their own safety.Yet this is about more than money: Keir Starmer accepted the Labour leadership on Saturday with the rousing Old Testament statement about all key workers, cleaners, paramedics, carers, porters: “For too long they’ve been taken for granted and poorly paid. They were last and now they should be first.” But what would it actually mean to put these jobs first? Money is some of the answer, but we also have to look at the conditions and assumptions that drive wage stagnation and the steady erosion of security.There is nothing radical in the observation that jobs are often described as low-skill, when actually they are just poorly paid. More radical, yet still accurate, is the assertion that they are characterised as “low-skill” deliberately. Caring is a job of tremendous skill, hard as well as soft. And while there is a huge amount of bolt-on expertise that employers require, from administering medicines to dealing with dementia, this is not reflected in any career progression. It is not unusual for a carer in her 40s to be on the same hourly rate, adjusted for inflation, that she was on at 18.This has been systematic, not accidental. Without progression, the wage bill can remain reliably static, which is the only way the financial architecture of the sector makes sense.There is often better progression in public sector work, but the combination of the austerity-years pay freeze and a new normal (extending even to the police) of people at the start of their career being expected to work voluntarily, which itself erodes starting salaries, has had a striking effect on these jobs.Ironically, Theresa May was right when she famously said that a nurse might use a food bank for “complicated reasons”. Of course there’s a very simple reason – that nurse is not being paid enough. But the feedback loop between the private and public sectors – low pay, insecurity and poor conditions legitimised in one sector and migrating to another – is actually quite complicated.And there’s an overarching fallacy, that a job many people could do must be inherently low in value. By these lights, huge numbers of people – cleaners, drivers, shop assistants – are without prospects, being so replaceable. The times are testing this assumption to destruction – when you’re looking for the people whose courage we need in order for civilisation to survive, you don’t have to look much further than the postal worker or the hospital porter.In the immediate term, putting key workers first means personal protective equipment it means collective and determined effort to strip as much risk as possible out of essential jobs that simply wouldn’t get done if everyone looked out for themselves. But there will be an era after coronavirus and one thing to carry into it will be a determination never again to think, talk about or treat people as though logic demands they should be screwed down to their lowest possible price."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c6a1b9ecb6ad5fe564085849317a604b8178568/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71d93dd061ed8520945e1c76cbf0f638","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of vivid","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘vivid’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘vivid’.Share your photos of what vivid means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 8 April at 10am.

We had a party in the office and I set my chest hair alight’ It was 1967 and I was 21, sleeping rough and hiding from the police in Edinburgh. One night I came across a big-nosed Scotsman called Gordon Roddick. We exchanged insults and became great friends. He met a young woman called Anita and I didn’t see them again for about 20 years, by which time they had started the Body Shop.In 1990, Gordon was in New York and this guy the size of a wardrobe tried to sell him a copy of a paper called Street News. They got talking and the man explained: “I buy the paper for 50 cents and I sell it for $1. It’s there to help the homeless.” Gordon thought this was brilliant. At that time, London and a number of other UK cities had thousands of homeless people. So he got money from the Body Shop Foundation to do a feasibility study about starting a British street paper.The next year, I was having dinner with Gordon and Anita, having moved into printing and publishing, and he asked me: “Why don’t you do the paper?” I said: “No fucking way am I working with a load of white, middle-class liberals and all their do-gooding bollocks.” I wasn’t a very nice person at the time. But I said I’d do the study, for £200 a day. Gordon said £100. I talked to a lot of homeless people and they told me that anything would be better than begging. Gordon gave me the money to start the Big Issue.I put together a really shambolic team. The guy who did the investigative journalism had only just left school. I got my brother to do distribution because he had a garage and a van. My assistant was a brilliant guitar-player who had never run a magazine. It was Mickey Mouse stuff, total chaos. We made a loss for months and Gordon was about to pull the plug, but we turned it around. You could cut the commitment in the editorial office with a knife. The sense of comradeship was incredible – we knew that what we were doing mattered. Nobody wanted to go home and when we did, we’d go via the pub and get pissed together. We had a party in the office once and I took my shirt off and set my chest hair alight. You could still smell it about a week later.There were 500 homeless organisations in London alone in 1991, giving out everything from sandwiches to condoms. But the one thing they didn’t give homeless people was a means of making their own money. What we said was: “If you’re going to help, you have to involve the homeless in their own redemption.” And that’s how the Big Issue transformed the homeless sector in this country. I had a cleaning business in central London. I would be out early in the morning every day and I’d see many homeless people. In Waterloo, all the arches that are now posh bars and restaurants were derelict. There’d be groups living in them, around big bonfires. It was like Mad Max.One day, my brother John told me there was potential for a homeless magazine. I was earning good money at the time but I was bored, so I offered a hand. I remember when the first load of magazines were due to be delivered to my garage – a bloody great articulated lorry turned up my road. The neighbours had to move their cars.We’d go to places where homeless people congregated and just hang around, talk to them. When we explained that they had to pay for the magazines, they told us to fuck off. But I don’t give up easily and neither does John. On several occasions, we were spat at and the van was kicked. I had to start carrying a baseball bat. Gradually, we gained people’s trust, because we persevered. We were there day in, day out. It just started to snowball.We work with the most chaotic sales force in the world. We have no idea whether people are going to turn up on a Monday morning or not. They come and go for different reasons, but no matter what else might be happening in their lives, the Big Issue is always there for them. It’s not us that make the magazine, it’s the vendors, out there selling in all weathers. If the public didn’t like them, they wouldn’t buy the magazine. Members of the public really care.We would never have believed it if you’d told us in 1991 that we’d still be around today, hundreds of millions of magazines sold, one of the biggest street papers in the world. We’d hoped to help get rid of homelessness. But that’s just a pipe dream, isn’t it? Just look at coronavirus – it’s going to wreck the economy, it’s going to wreck families. The Big Issue needs to be around for those people. Our vendors are off the streets right now for the first time in our history. But if the public support us through this, we’ll come back stronger.• Subscribe for three months at bigissue and have the magazine delivered weekly.

This is the opposite of Covid-19,” said the study’s lead author, Prof Russell Viner, of UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health.“Data on the benefit of school closures in the Covid-19 outbreak is limited but what we know shows that their impact is likely to be only small compared with other infection-control measures such as case isolation and is only effective when other social isolating measures are adhered to.”Viner, who is president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the benefit gained from closing schools had to be weighed against the costs. “Children’s education is damaged and their mental health may suffer, family finances are affected, key workers may need to stay home to look after children and vulnerable children may suffer most.”He also highlighted the need to start working out how to return students to education and keep them in school safely.“Countries that have closed schools, such as the UK, have to now ask hard questions about when and how to open schools. Interventions in schools, such as closing playgrounds, keeping students in constant class groupsclassrooms, increasing spacing between students in classes, reducing the school week and staggering school start and break times across years or classes should be considered if restrictive social distancing policies are to be implemented for long periods of time.”Prof Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, who is one of the key epidemiologists advising the government, said: “While school closure as a measure on its own is predicted to have a limited effectiveness in controlling Covid-19 transmission, when combined with intense social distancing it plays an important role in severing remaining contacts between households and thus ensuring transmission declines.”Robert Dingwall, a professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University, said the UCL study suggested the public health benefits of school closures were not proportionate to the social and economic costs imposed on children and their families.“It also underlines how the assumptions used in modelling the Covid-19 pandemic may rest on very flimsy foundations in terms of scientific evidence. This work suggests that UK schools could and should begin to reopen as soon as practicable after the initial wave of cases has passed through.”The study team included researchers from UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, UCL Institute of Education, London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, University of Cambridge and University of Sydney. The study is published in the Lancet Child and Adolescent Health journal.A government spokesperson said: “The decision to close schools was taken in line with scientific advice on how to limit the spread of the coronavirus. We asked most children to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives.“Schools will remain closed until further notice, except for children of critical workers and the children who are most vulnerable. We will reopen schools when the scientific advice indicates it is safe to do so.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d39e8dd5e7247decbd10317791828a5da2695cd9/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc3dd2d1ad27756a560b8323796a14f1","title":"arts society to launch online lectures for over 70s","story":"Lineup includes online lectures, films and live Q\u0026ampAs over the next few monthsA free lockdown arts programme aimed at the over-70s will kick off on Tuesday morning with a lecture on one of the most mysterious paintings in art: the Velázquez masterpiece Las Meninas.The Arts Society, the UK’s leading arts education charity with 90,000 members, has announced a series of free online lectures, film screenings and live Q\u0026ampAs by authors that will run over the coming months.The society’s bread and butter activity is helping to stage events and museum trips where its members meet up for cultural activities face to face. Now they are among those hit hardest by the crisis.Florian Schweizer, the society’s chief executive, said: “A lot of our members are more mature which is why our initial response was: ‘How can we get them connected back with each other and with us?’“Local committees have all been chatting away on forums and are responding so well to the crisis. It really has been lovely and quite moving to see things that would have probably taken years to organise, happen within two or three weeks. I’m really proud of our members.”The first lecture being broadcast at 11am on Tuesday is by the art historian Jacqueline Cockburn and was recorded in her home by her son. She had been due to lecture on Picasso at the society’s now-cancelled annual general meeting and suggested Las Meninas, which hangs in the Prado in Madrid, as a shorter alternative for the new project.Subsequent lectures will include talks by Antiques Roadshow regulars Mark Hill and Marc Allum, the UK’s leading Aboriginal art expert Rebecca Hossack, and the art critic Sarah Dunant. Tate curator and JMW Turner expert Nicola Moorby will talk about the new £20 note, which features the artist.The Arts Society consists of 380 inidual membership groups, which organise regular lectures and educational trips to museums and galleries throughout the year.Schweizer said the new digital platform, titled The Arts Society Connected, aims to help people stay “educated, entertained and informed” over the next three months.It will be free to members or indeed anyone who fancies watching and taking part in community forums before and after the events.As well as fortnightly lectures there will be monthly film screenings, beginning with one titled Easter in Art. There will also be a package of social media training for people who feel they need it.The initiative is one of many being launched by museums, galleries, charities and inidual artists to help get people through the lockdown.“We believe the arts have the power to bring people together, and we will not let this virus stop communities from enjoying the arts with each other,” said Schweizer.“We are working with our thousands of volunteers to develop new skills and initiatives, building resilience and a future in which many of our members will embrace digital as a valuable addition to their cultural experience.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb8a132535a580f34dc1a2dcbca20c020df5fcdb/0_52_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e2fcd9d720af20612195cab87955264","title":"my favourite film aged 12 the net","story":"Continuing our series of writers rewatching old favourites, we revisit a conspiracy thriller featuring peril, pizza – and a prescient Sandra BullockWhen interviewing an actor or director I admire, I’ve made it a personal mission to avoid sycophancy: I’m there for something resembling a business meeting, not a fan convention. I’m not cold, far from it, but I’m also not about to invite Noah Baumbach for cocktails so I can ramble on at him about how The Squid and the Whale spoke to my inner child of orce. I know my place and I know theirs. But there was one time, back in 2013, when I simply couldn’t help myself.I was at the Gravity junket interviewing Sandra Bullock, stuck with a thankless conveyor-belt slot, shuffled in for less than 10 minutes after waiting for more than three hours. She was as charming as I’d expected, based both on rumblings from within the industry and from the fondness I’d had for her as a child, when I had VHS copies of Speed and The Net on rotation for a solid year. While the former remains a sturdy favourite and inarguably the better movie, it was the latter that jimmied its way further into my life, and in that clinical hotel room 18 years later words tumbled out of my mouth before I had the smarts to stop them. Our time was up and, as I waited for the footage of our interview, I splurged out some nonsense about what an integral film it had been to my 11-year-old self. She was politely enthused to hear it (or convincingly acted that way), telling me that it was a film ahead of its time, and, as I was ushered out of the room, I yelled something in agreement, a dumb comment about how radical it had been to see someone order pizza on a computer. (It really had been, though.)It was a lapse, from film journalist to fanboy, but it was because the film really had been a key part of my life, for reasons that haven’t always been clear to me. Watching it again, 25 years after its release, I was struck by the many things about The Net that didn’t work (with less far-fetched hokeyness, it could have been a more chilling thriller) but more so I was rewarded by seeing the many aspects of it that did. As Bullock told me years later, the film really was quite astonishing in its forward-thinking view of the internet’s perils.In 1995, my awareness of an online world was vague, as it was for most people. My main source of information was the big screen and within the space of a few months, I had seen both The Net and Hackers. While the latter, starring a young Angelina Jolie, was far zippier and lighter, the messages were similar: be careful.In The Net, Bullock plays systems analyst Angela Bennett who finds herself stuck in a Hitchcockian nightmare partly of her own making. In the nascent internet, Angela has found a place to hide, a way to justify her loneliness as optional, retreating into a digital community far more welcoming than the real-world one that’s pushed her away. But her lack of human ties makes her an easy target, and when she stumbles on a terrorist conspiracy, she struggles to convince anyone of its legitimacy. Angela’s identity is stolen while she’s on vacation after a holiday romance is revealed to be a sinister scam and her perfect, box-ticking suitor to be a fraud. He’s been sent to kill her, and, after the pair have had sex, in the film’s most horrifying moment, he reveals that his seduction was based entirely on information she’d shared in a chatroom. It remains a powerfully invasive moment, naked and nasty like many of the film’s cruellest strokes, it’s also one that’s gained relevance with time.What’s perhaps most intriguingly prescient about the plot is that the group of online villains is revealed to have been in cahoots with big tech all along – a suitably sour endnote for a film charged with an aggressive distrust of digital culture. At one point Angela, exhausted and infuriated after her identity has been stolen, says to her lawyer: “They’ve done it to me and they’re gonna do it to you.” While few of us have had an evil group of cyber-terrorists try to kill us for knowing too much about their nefarious activities, many have had their debit card, and in turn their identity, stolen at least once?I’d like to say that it was my equally progressive view of the dangers of tech that had me enthralled, but I think my enjoyment was far more simplistic. At that time, I hadn’t seen the many films The Net was shamelessly cribbing from at that age, so its tale of a woman caught up in a shadowy conspiracy felt fresh and involving, playing on a fury at the injustice of it all. I was also captivated by Bullock, a luminous star swiftly ascending to the A-list, who became a safe teen crush, an actor who I secretly just wanted to hang out with.I avoided the Bullock-free “2.0” sequel and the barely watched the one-season TV show, but I’ve thought often about the original, for its entertainment value, its Nu Nostradamus thinking and, as rediscovered fairly recently, for what happened directly after my initial viewing. A few years back I found a diary I’d kept at the time, one that contained short, direct, businesslike entries mainly focused on media consumption. On the Saturday I saw the film, at the cinema with my mum, it read: “Saw The Net today which was really good but then came home and my rabbit died which was really bad.” It’s either a credit to the film or a comment on my damaged psyche that it was The Net that left a more lasting impression."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f69d5b4ad2e753ad2c4c2468a61049334f066b9/55_142_3045_1827/master/3045..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4d2b8e49aa682ff10bbe3c86ba7677d","title":"wolves diogo jota im coaching telford united on football manager","story":"The forward on how his club have helped players, missing family in Portugal and his boyhood teamDiogo Jota has not been making headlines recently because, like most people, he has been observing the British government’s lockdown. But in the simpler time before football and society were placed into suspended animation, Jota looked to be building towards something sensational.His devastating bursts from the left side of Wolves’ attacks brought six goals in five matches before the hiatus, taking his tally to the season to 15 goals. Wolves were well placed in both the Premier League and the Europa League. Then the whole world pressed pause and none of that was important.Jota has no complaints, he understands. As he and everyone else wait for the pandemic to subside, the 23-year-old agreed to reflect on his career and the season so far. What harm can that do? He talked about his and Wolves’ improvement, as well as Liverpool’s title credentials and the unique impact made by his Portuguese compatriot Bruno Fernandes at Manchester United.First, though, he said how strange it is to be so far from his family in Portugal at a time of crisis while acknowledging that he has a lot to be thankful for, nonetheless. “If I was in Portugal it might be even more difficult to manage, as I would be closer to them and the temptation to have social contacts would be greater,” he said.Wolves were the first top-flight club to close their stadium following the suspension of the league, with their chairman, Jeff Shi, saying his ties to China made him “acutely aware” of the dangers of the coronavirus and immediately pledging to ensure all staff continue to be paid throughout this “period of uncertainty”. The company that owns the club, Fosun, donated 2,300 coverall and face masks to local hospitals.The players, meanwhile, have been benefiting from an enviable level of care. “The club have helped us in everything,” said Jota. “The club managed to find a basket with all kinds of food, so we don’t have to go shopping. And in the medical area, we were given a kit with everything we need. I’m talking about masks, hand sanitiser and everything. The club does everything in their power so that we don’t miss anything.”As for keeping fit before the notional resumption of the season, “the coaching staff drew up a plan for this first stage, which is said to last until the end of April but from the looks of it, it will last beyond that”, Jota told the Portuguese newspaper Record. “We have an inidual work plan, with the idea of being as close to our best shape as possible.”For Jota, football is a passion that never stops. So during his confinement, he has been playing a virtual version of it. “I happen to be training Telford United on Football Manager,” he said. “I’m already in 2029.” Being a playtime coach makes him appreciate all the more the work that Nuno Espírito Santo and Wolves’ backroom have done in real life to lift the club to where they are now from the Championship, which is where they were when Jota joined from Atlético Madrid in 2017, initially on loan.“For example, if we look at last season compared to this one, we see that we have been changing the tactical system a few times, adapting to the opposing teams, taking away from them any chance of breaking our system. And with these systems enhancing our qualities, we players have to adapt and help the team as well as possible.”Which is not to say that Liverpool are his favourite Merseyside club. When he was growing up in Portugal, the English team he most enjoyed watching wore blue. “I loved to watch Everton play, especially when they were playing at home,” said Jota. “It was not a club that fought for the title but that always made life very complicated for the big teams. And I loved that drive and competitiveness. They were relentless.”“You can clearly see the difference between United with and without Bruno Fernandes. He takes on the responsibility and aspires for more than what they are doing. I think they owe him a lot already. And that is not only related to his quality, but also to his ambition and personality.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc6e4d58868e6b31cb163fabacf3a3b57d735eaa/56_137_2849_1709/master/2849..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f8ef211db2bd762696c2b7b59db0ccc","title":"english football blame culture premier league","story":"Matt Hancock is merely the latest patsy to offend a game that was dysfunctional even when it was awash with moneyI don’t expect to make too many friends saying this, but perhaps it’s time we all gave Matt Hancock a break. Isn’t it typical how, as soon as things take a turn for the worse, everyone starts singling out the health secretary?Yes, clearly he could be doing more to deflect our attention from the failings of his dangerously shambolic government and the chronic underfunding of the National Health Service. And he wants to do more, too.But there are plenty of other hapless Conservative MPs out there desperately trying to distract us from the fatally inept response to the Covid-19 outbreak by warbling on about footballers. And yet while people such as Julian Knight and Steve Brine get off scot-free, for some reason it’s always Hancock who gets saddled with the blame. It’s an easy target. Cheap populism.Then again, in these extraordinary times for English football, the thirst for scapegoats, sacrificial lambs and other forms of votive livestock appears to be stronger than ever. Blame culture is nothing new to the game but the urgency of the current crisis appears to have broadened its scope beyond the time-honoured targets of referees, television pundits and FA Cup replays.Hancock is simply the latest patsy to walk into the crosshairs and discover that if you thought English football was dysfunctional when it was awash with money, just see what happens when you turn the money off.In a way it’s strangely fitting that as the rest of us grapple with questions of life and death, of physical and mental health, of personal freedom and human connection, English football finds itself embroiled in an unseemly wrestle over its favourite topic. At the weekend, talks between the Professional Footballers’ Association and the Premier League over a collective pay cut disintegrated into a slurry of arch statements and snide briefings.Meanwhile Newcastle and Tottenham are among the clubs to have attracted widespread scorn for claiming taxpayers’ money while placing staff on furlough. Disgruntled broadcasters are threatening to withhold payments and with every passing day of lockdown the existential threat to livelihoods, to entire clubs, perhaps even to entire leagues, looms ever larger.This is not, for all the wailing sirens and general sensation of panic, a short-term development. In many ways this is a mud fight that has been brewing for some time: years, perhaps even decades. English football’s inability to come together and function as a collective did not happen overnight it occurred, instead, in small devastating steps.You could pinpoint, for example, Tottenham’s circumvention of the FA’s Rule 35 in 1983, allowing them to float on the stock market and irrevocably transforming the modern football club into a profit-making vehicle. The formation of the Premier League, orcing the largest clubs of any statutory obligation to the rest of the pyramid, ingraining light-touch regulation and free-market economics as cultural ideals.The largely unchecked influx of billionaire owners in the early 21st century: in recent days plenty of outrage has been directed at figures such as Joe Lewis at Spurs and Mike Ashley at Newcastle, blithely availing themselves of public handouts while placing low-paid staff on leave. But as the old proverb goes, if you’re going to invite ducks into your kitchen, don’t be surprised when they clear out your bread bin.And so the story of English football’s boom years is also one of atomisation, detachment and polarisation: the gradual entrenchment of the Thatcherite compact that we are all eternally in competition. Fans are stirred and stoked and set against each other. Governing bodies scrap for reach and audience and space in the calendar. Clubs, now competing on the balance sheet as well as the pitch, are aligned not in accordance with a wider ecosystem but the inidual will and ambition of their owners. Above all, the law of the market reigns supreme: a hierarchy of revenue generation where the language of wealth is the only acceptable tongue.There is an element of broad-brush here but the wider point remains: if you were trying to design a system hostile to collaboration and solidarity, you could scarcely do better than English football in 2020. Tribal, commercial self-interest is why the game can barely lift a finger to fight racism. It’s why the application of video technology has been such a mess. It’s why scheduling and player workload are a disgrace. It’s why there is still no sustainable funding model for the women’s game. And in the jaws of its worst crisis in a generation, it may just be why its ham-fisted attempts to secure its own future have descended into discord, distrust and in-fighting.

The French Football Federation is working to set up a solidarity fund for ailing clubs. Of course no country’s game is free of greed, bickering or self-interest but there does seem something innate in English football’s resistance to collective action, its lionisation of the one-off gesture, the inidual act of generosity, the PR coup or– as Liverpool neatly demonstrated on Monday evening – the PR-inspired U-turn.It’s the stench of a sport that has gnawed away at its own wider obligations until there are virtually none left to speak of, that has largely shed its pretence of shared destiny and interdependence, the sense that on some level we are all part of the same game. This pandemic has exposed the faultlines in English football, an unsatisfying coalition of chaos that may yet come loose entirely. What emerges from the rubble is anyone’s guess."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e9b49a2c2f44d9b92e2d1a9fdc0ba67e84f3bf2/0_77_5649_3391/master/5649..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bae5b117ba9759c9fc36c6886c0f4f46","title":"primark announces wage fund for garment workers","story":"Pledge comes in response to claims that order cancellations to minimise Covid-19 losses have hurt millions of workers in the developing worldPrimark, one of the UK’s most popular retailers, has announced it will create a fund to help pay the wages of the millions of garment workers affected by its decision to cancel tens of millions of pounds worth of clothing orders from factories in developing countries across the world.The pledge followed sustained criticism of the fashion retailer after data from the Bangladeshi and Garment Exporters Association (BGMEA) revealed it had cancelled all orders already placed with suppliers.Collectively brands including Primark, Matalan and Edinburgh Woollen Company have cancelled £1.4bn and suspended an additional £1bn of orders in Bangladesh alone as they scramble to minimise losses in the face of the Covid-19 epidemic. The move has already seen more than a million Bangladeshi garment workers lose their jobs or be sent home without pay.Primark has announced that it will create a fund to help pay the wages of workers linked to orders that were due for shipment in the month after they were cancelled in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.However, the brand also stipulated that the wage compensation would be adjusted to take into account government support packages, a caveat that has caused confusion among suppliers and industry bodies.“While we welcome Primark’s announcement that they will compensate workers for the wages they will lose as a result of these cancelled orders, it is not clear enough what they mean,” says Rubana Huq, chairperson of the BGMEA. “Wage compensation should not take government loans into consideration. These brands have existing business commitments with their suppliers that are their responsibility to honour.”Factory owners in Bangladesh also asked for further clarity about whether Primark would agree to pay invoices for any of the completed orders it has cancelled or for any of the raw materials already purchased by suppliers.Due to the Covid-19 epidemic, all of Primark’s retail outlets have closed, with monthly losses estimated at £650m. Primark chief executive Paul Marchant said that the company already has £1.6bn of paid-for stock in stores that it currently cannot sell.“Every one of our stores around the world is closed. With a backlog of stock in stores, depots and in transit, we have had to make the very difficult decision to cancel orders for future stock,” he says.“Finding a way to ensure that workers in our supply chain in these countries are paid has been a priority over the past two weeks and we are pleased that this fund will provide relief to these workers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce8c303935e35b3ae3afd3784d78e50cf9af43d2/1664_1470_4982_2989/master/4982..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da4e64dfb85b22b9bc3af498aa1284bf","title":"how are you celebrating your birthday under coronavirus lockdown","story":"If you are expecting a birthday while under practicing physical distancing due to coronavirus, we’d like to hear from youWith the UK in its third week of government measures to avoid the spread of coronavirus, we would like to hear from those who are celebrating their birthdays under lockdown.How will you be celebrating your birthday?

Oxygen was available through a mask on the ward he was admitted to on Sunday, but the move to intensive care on Monday strongly suggests that was not enough to help him with the breathing problems caused by the viral pneumonia that the virus triggers.Anyone who is put on a ventilator will need to be sedated, although they are not unconscious. A tube must be inserted into the patient’s windpipe, so that air and oxygen from the machine can be blown into the lungs. That takes the strain off the lungs while they recover.Ventilation is vital in most severe Covid-19 cases, which is why there has been a huge effort to obtain more machines and even encourage engineering businesses to switch production lines to make them.In the severest cases, patients are put on an ECMO machine (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), which can support both the heart and lungs where somebody is in a life-threatening condition.Johnson’s admission to intensive care comes shortly after the 10th day of the illness, which has been identified as a real danger point. During the first week, most people’s immune systems rally and manage to fight off the virus. Those who do not recover and continue to struggle for breath and have a fever often need help around the middle of the second week.In that second week, the immune system can sometimes go into overdrive. In its attempt to fight the virus, it creates what is called a cytokine storm, in which the immune system attacks the body’s own organs. The heart, the liver and kidneys are most likely to be affected and all of them can need to be supported by machines that can take over their function.Derek Hill, professor of medical imaging at University College London, said: “It seems clear that the prime minister went to hospital because he had difficulty breathing. It seems he was initially put on oxygen, and was conscious.“But as often happens with Covid-19, his condition has now deteriorated so he has been admitted to intensive care.“We understand the PM is on a type of breathing support called Continuous positive airway pressure (Cpap), which is commonly used in treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea. Experience in Italy and other European countries has shown that Cpap can be effective in Covid-19 patients, at least initially. Many Covid-19 patients progress to invasive ventilation. Invasive ventilation involves a tube being put down the patient’s airway.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdad0f2c60481293ee058274a5bba350411f7e29/0_441_9073_5446/master/9073..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e64b6cb3831610de0d2b465335d43975","title":"ruffled raab gives little clue of true state of prime ministers health","story":"The de facto PM offers a barely credible performance at the daily coronavirus press conference Just about the only reassuring thing to come out of the latest Downing Street press conference was that Dominic Raab does not yet have his hands on the nuclear button.Because in almost every other respect the foreign secretary appeared to be cosplaying Peter Sellers in Dr Strangelove. A man so clinically unstable he has yet to realise he is by far the most dangerous person in any room he enters.The pathology manifests itself in different ways. Often Raab is a ball of barely repressed anger, the vein on this forehead throbbing metronomically as he tries to front out any tricky questions.Today, he was going for the more laid-back approach – the Mr Nice Guy who definitely had no guilty secrets. Unfortunately for him, he had more to hide than the usual collection of unsolved murders. Sooner or later, someone is going to have to have a quiet word with Dom and tell him he’s crap at this gig. Then so is almost everyone else in the cabinet.To be fair, Dom had been dealt a particularly bad hand. After the usual disclaimers about the government having done a generally brilliant job so far, the foreign secretary was rather obliged to give an update on the prime minister’s health.Something he tried to mumble away as an afterthought. Boris Johnson was in top form, excellent spirits. In fact, he was having such a good time running the country from his bed in St Thomas’ hospital that he was planning to extend his stay to an extra night.There was basically nothing wrong with Boris, was the message. He’d just dropped in to hospital because he was getting a bit bored at home.Understandably, no one was particularly convinced by Raab’s “He’s in good spirits” explanation of the prime minister’s health. After all, most people who have had even a mild version of the coronavirus have reported they were whacked out for the best part of a week and good for next to nothing.Yet here was Raab trying to persuade us that despite having a high temperature, a cough and breathing difficulties, Johnson was on top form and fit for anything. Being prime minister was actually a piece of piss that anyone could do from hospital. No big deal. “He’s in good spirits,” Raab again repeated, his eyes darting anxiously around the room. Mr Cool was now looking decidedly ruffled and he inadvertently let slip the truth. The last time he had actually spoken to the prime minister was on Saturday, the day before Boris was admitted to hospital.So we were asked to accept that for the last two days he had been entirely out of the loop and that Boris had been running the show on his own. Not necessarily bad news for the country, but badly credible.There was only one inescapable conclusion. That Boris doesn’t rate either Raab or Michael Gove as suitable deputies to run the country in his absence and reckons that he could probably still do a better job than either of them from his hospital bed. It’s a lack of trust with which most of the country has some sympathy.Occasionally, Raab would desperately look to the newly recovered chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the Foreign Office deputy chief medical adviser, Angela McLean, for reassurance. Which they both refused to give. Though the nation was pleased to see him back, Whitty rather looked as if he would be elsewhere. Probably visiting his second home, like the Scottish chief medical officer. That way he would have to resign and wouldn’t have to put himself through any more of these excruciating press conferences.Long before the end, Raab had managed to muddle up even the most basic of messages. Last week, both Boris and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had offered a glimmer of hope with a lockdown exit strategy, involving arm bands and antibody test. All that was now long forgotten as Dom pointed to some slides that showed it was far too early to be making any of those kinds of predictions. We were going backwards fast.A consistent display in hopelessness by the hopeless. A briefing that had only served to muddy the waters further: the Queen’s call for national unity a distant memory. For what came through clearest was that no one in government really had a clue what was happening. Even the de facto prime minister wasn’t being informed about the prime minister’s condition.Within hours the mirage had dropped. The press conference a total irrelevance. What Dom had or hadn’t known was immaterial. During the afternoon Boris’s condition had worsened and he was being transferred to intensive care. Dom was now acting prime minister. All that anyone could do now was put their trust in the doctors and pray for the best. The crisis had just got significantly worse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df8865475d903e08fad99e84fa7fdcbf5bd53137/0_236_3500_2101/master/3500..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8ec275d3eb43f6ccfcbfd6bb43c9c36","title":"what are the uks options for exiting the coronavirus lockdown","story":"Strategies could include mass testing, rolling on-off lockdowns and immunity passportsFour days ago, Boris Johnson was heralding a ramp-up of testing as “the way through the coronavirus puzzle”. His health secretary, Matt Hancock, was even floating the idea of immunity passports for people who could be confirmed as having recovered from the virus, so that they could return to work.But on Monday the government’s message was very different, following multiple reports that antibody tests were showing poor reliability. One government adviser, Prof Sir John Bell of Oxford University, said testing was at least a month away.Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, said it was too early yet to be talking about an exit strategy from the lockdown. Even discussing ways out could “confuse the messaging” about the importance of sticking to physical distancing rules, he added.While ministers and their advisers might not want to discuss exit strategies openly, the  here explores four options.

The strategy was abandoned in early March when the government changed tack from containing to delaying the outbreak. The move unleashed a wave of criticism. The World Health Organization has stressed throughout that testing, contact tracing and quarantine are vital steps towards bringing the pandemic under control. “We have got to be able to show that we can go after the virus, because lockdowns alone will not work,” Dr Michael Ryan, the WHO’s director of emergencies, said last week.Hancock has talked of scaling up tests to 100,000 a day, but there has been no official commitment to contact tracing. Despite this, both are more than likely to feature in the exit strategy. Prof Neil Ferguson, whose outbreak modelling team at Imperial College London is advising the government, said this weekend that if the lockdown sufficiently reduced new cases then mass testing and contact tracing would “almost certainly” be introduced to try to keep a lid on the pandemic.The strategy has its challenges. The UK is desperately building up its testing capacity but the expansion needed is unprecedented and other countries are competing for the same equipment and chemicals. Contact tracing is labour intensive, and scientists have called on Public Health England to recruit a volunteer army to help identify potential cases. One hope is that an NHS contact tracing app can help by sending alerts to users who come into contact with infected people. But the app has already raised privacy concerns: to be effective it would require about 40 million people in the UK to sign up and share their health and location data.One of the problems with the strategy is that no one knows who is vulnerable. As the deaths of doctors, nurses and young children have shown, it is not only older people or those with underlying conditions who fail to recover from the virus. This means acquiring herd immunity by letting the virus sweep through puts a staggering number of lives at risk.With the lockdown and physical distancing in place, the number of new infections should steadily fall, and unless millions of infections have gone undetected, herd immunity is unlikely to develop in the current outbreak. According to Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University, one way out of the lockdown is to beef up protection around those who are known to be at risk. With intense testing of NHS workers, care home staff and others, the most vulnerable could be better shielded from the infection, drastically cutting the number of people who end up in intensive care. “That is where testing could really help get us out of this,” Woolhouse said.The lockdown and physical distancing are intended to spread the epidemic out so that hospitals do not face thousands of sick patients at once but rather a steadier stream over time. This “flattening of the curve” can save lives if intensive care units can treat and discharge the most seriously ill patients before new cases arrive. The Imperial College team that is modelling the outbreak found that the government may need to alternate between lockdown and looser rules, relaxing and then imposing the restrictions again if case numbers rebound as expected. This could potentially go on for months, depending on whether new antiviral drugs are found or a vaccine becomes available. “There is not going to be a cure for this, but if we can find a drug that works, and if we can give it to people early enough, you can stop them progressing to serious disease and needing a critical care bed,” said Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia. The government has ordered 17.5m antibody home-testing kits, but none have yet proved reliable. Some senior scientists say the tests may pick up only half of those who have had the virus, in part because people with milder infections tend to have lower levels of antibodies in their blood. The poor performance appears to scupper hopes for using the tests soon to issue “immunity passports” so that the immune can return to work – an idea under active consideration in the UK and Germany. Even if accurate tests can be obtained, they may not be the “game-changer” that Johnson has claimed. No one knows whether antibodies in the blood mean full or only partial protection against the virus, nor how long any protection would last, making immunity passports a shaky reassurance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed246ee52ad419dbc9777baefc448e8ac78bdc9b/0_250_2962_1778/master/2962..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d934f800317a24f17f1dccd35c9ed5b4","title":"tell us have you found a new job during the coronavirus pandemic","story":"We would like to hear from people who are newly employed in jobs that have become ever more essential due to the lockdownThousands of new jobs delivering food and medicines, working in supply chains and in supermarkets have been created during the coronavirus pandemic.People who have been furloughed from their jobs or fired altogether will have filled some of these roles, along with the previously unemployed.We would like to hear from the people with new jobs doing essential work who have never worked in those areas before.What is your new job?

Team USA would still be strong even without her thoughLast week when Simone Biles spoke to the press for the first time since the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics, she failed to guarantee she would be back for the rescheduled Games in 2021. “I haven’t decided not to do it, but I haven’t really decided to do it,” she told the Wall Street Journal.This was not what we wanted to hear from one of the world’s most exciting athletes. Biles was heading into Tokyo 2020 as the overwhelming favorite to win her second consecutive Olympic all-around title. That would have been a fitting capstone for the 23-year-old’s record-breaking career. Though Biles had been adamant for the past year that she would retire after the 2020 Olympics, most assumed she would continue her career so she could compete in 2021 instead. Biles’ reasons for not immediately committing to next’s summer’s Olympics are sensible: the toll another year of training would take on her already aching body the desire to move on with her life and another year of dealing with USA Gymnastics, one of the institutions that enabled former team doctor Larry Nassar to abuse Biles and dozens of other athletes. “I don’t know if I can deal with USAG for another year,” she said.While I’m still betting on Biles being in Tokyo next year, it’s worth contemplating what a US effort without her would look like. She’s been a key part of the program for eight years and it’s hard to imagine the team without her.First, let’s be clear about one thing – the US would still take the women’s team title in Tokyo next year even without Biles. The American program has a deep bench, deeper than any other women’s program. There is definitely a fourth (or fifth or eighth) gymnast that can put up strong scores across the board and help the American women secure victory.But a Biles-less team win wouldn’t look exactly the same. The point margins over the other top teams would be slimmer. At the 2019 world championships, Biles’ floor score, for instance, was a point higher than the other two Americans, whose own floor scores were a point higher than the next best marks from Russia. The US will certainly be able to find another gymnast who can score in the same range as the other Americans but it’s unlikely that they will find one who will score as Biles would. In 2015, gymnastics blogger Lauren Hopkins pointed out that “between 2014 and 2015, the US team improved their final score by about two points. Of these two points, seven tenths came from Biles with the other 1.3 ided among the other four gymnasts.” And this was before she started extending her all-around margins into “fall more than once and still win” territory. Also, Biles competed on all four apparatuses in team finals during the last three major team championships. Replacing Biles means replacing four scores in the team final.And then there’s Biles’ formidable inidual medal haul. Biles in Tokyo probably means four gold medals – all-around, vault, beam, and floor. The US certainly has gymnasts that are capable of bringing in medals in all of those disciplines, but their medals are not as assured as Biles’ are. The best bet for a US gold without Biles is vault where Jade Carey excels.Biles is a three-time world champion on the balance beam but her record is, by her standards, spotty. If she hits, she is one of the favorites to win but if she misses – as she did in 2016 and 2018 – she may end up with a medal but it won’t be gold. But beam, in particular, is where the US is loaded with talent. There’s Kara Eaker, who would have been world champion in 2018 if not for a mistake in the finals, and Morgan Hurd, a world silver medalist in 2017. As for floor, the US is reasonably assured of walking away with a medal there as well, perhaps even gold. Even without Biles, the Americans boast some of the best tumblers in the world.And finally, the most prestigious inidual contest, the all-around final. Biles has dominated the all-around since her senior debut in 2013. The US certainly has other gymnasts who can win – the Americans won three consecutive Olympic all-around titles before Biles came on the scene – but their wins are not guaranteed. Sunisa Lee, like 2017 world champion Hurd and a couple of other Americans, can win the all-around title on a good day but only a good day. Only Biles can win it on a bad day.All of this prognosticating is based on what the Olympics would have looked like this summer. But 2021 is not 2020. Over the next 16 months, a lot will change. Perhaps there will be injuries to the current group of top contenders. The year before the Games entails some of the most arduous training of a gymnast’s career. The athletes, who were more than halfway through that year, will be forced to endure it all over again. For some, it will be too much. And there will be gymnasts who were already injured but will now perhaps have enough time to recover. In February, Asuka Teramoto of Japan ruptured her achilles. She was out of the picture for Tokyo 2020 but she could very well be back in the mix for 2021.Then there is a whole new crop of contenders who were too young to compete in Tokyo this year but will be 16 and therefore age eligible next year. Two of the most promising juniors who will now be able to compete in 2021 are Konnor McClain of the US and Viktoria Listunova of Russia. The former is the best junior gymnast in the US with enormous potential on balance beam the latter is the reigning junior world champion. (The International Gymnastics Federation is set to decide what to do about the new seniors in regards to the 2021 Olympics in the next two weeks.)Shortly after the Olympic postponement was announced, Yahoo Sports ran a story about McClain and her Olympic prospects if she competes at the 2021 Games. While McClain’s coach was circumspect about her chances, noting that the gymnast’s preparation had been oriented towards the 2024 Games, 2008 Olympic champion Shawn Johnson posited that McClain could be a potential rival for Biles due to the junior’s youthfulness. That was a ridiculous assertion. While McClain, who was just 32 days shy of 2020 eligibility, is an enormously talented gymnast and an exciting prospect for the future, she has yet to compete as a senior. McClain has a lot to prove before she can be considered a rival to the GOAT.So much can happen in a year. The future is always uncertain but it feels even more so during this pandemic. Biles, who has been a sure thing in gymnastics for the last eight years, won’t give us the certainty we’re desperately seeking by committing to 2021. She can’t even give herself that kind of assurance. Biles, like the rest of us, is going to have to take this one day, one week, one month at a time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97be5e49603ed15b9d257c1727eee029d75a5d19/467_97_4419_2652/master/4419..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fd8d9c763916b0eaeaa7357dbfb260e","title":"apple macbook air review 2020 near perfect consumer laptop","story":"Updated processors, a price drop and an excellent new keyboard only add to this fantastic traditional laptopApple’s latest MacBook Air has a new, fixed and more satisfying keyboard, improved processors and gets a price drop.From the outside essentially nothing has changed. The new 2020 MacBook Air looks just like the revamped machine launched in 2018, except it costs £200 less than its predecessor, with the base model starting at £999.In a world filled with convertibles, 2-in-1s and fancy tablet computers, the MacBook Air stands apart as an attractive design that is the pinnacle of the traditional laptop form. An instant classic.If you had a pair of callipers you might be able to tell that the new MacBook Air is 0.5mm thicker and 40g heavier than the old one, but there’s a good reason for that: a new keyboard that’s just a smidgen thicker. More on that in a moment.The 13.3in screen is crisp and beautiful, now supporting Apple’s True Tone technology, which adjusts the screens colours depending on ambient light. It was a feature restricted to the MacBook Pro in Apple’s laptop line until now.The 1.29kg MacBook Air compares favourably with rivals, but is heavier than tablet PCs such as Microsoft’s 775g Surface Pro 7 (1.13g with keyboard attached).It replaces the ill-fated butterfly keyboard and should render troubles with stuck keys a thing of the past. It also has double the key travel at 1mm of depth and a far more satisfying typing experience.The keys feel solid, depress far enough and are fairly quiet as laptop keyboards go. It is very close to being best-in-class, just behind the keyboard on Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 3.Apple’s Force Touch trackpad continues to be the very best you can buy on a laptop. It is large, precise and smooth: all-round excellent.A Touch ID fingerprint scanner is built into the power button in the top right corner of the keyboard. It works well as an alternative to passwords, but can only recognise three fingerprints. One day I hope Apple puts its excellent Face ID system in its laptops to match Microsoft’s excellent Windows Hello system in its computers.The MacBook Air as tested was the base model costing £999 with an Intel Core i3 processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.General computing performance was surprisingly good from the Core i3 version, including when connected to a 4K display. Where it struggled was attempting to do fairly complex edits to images in Affinity Photo or perform multiple tasks at once, such as downloading app updates and using relatively complex web apps in Chrome – something I’ve not noticed with any Core i5-powered machines in the last few years.If you’re a light computer user the Core i3 version will be perfectly adequate. But I would recommend most pay the extra £100 to upgrade to the quad-core Core i5 processor, which is far more capable and will be able to handle demanding programs and extensive multitasking, as you would expect from a computer costing £1,099.The MacBook Air lasts about eight to nine hours of general work, including using Chrome with about 10 or so tabs open, various chat apps, Typora text editor, Affinity Photo, Apple Mail and a few other bits – enough to get a work day done without having to reach for a charger.Worth noting in these difficult times that a 50-minute video call knocked around two hours off the usual battery life so you’ll need the charger more often.The computer is generally repairable too, although it was awarded only a 4 out of 10 for repairability by specialists iFixit, with downsides being the inability to upgrade the RAM or SSD.Apple also offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.The MacBook Air ships with Apple’s latest macOS 10.15 Catalina, which continues to be a mature and well-thought-out operating system that makes the most of Apple’s laptops.The most useful addition this time round is Sidecar, which turns an iPad into a second screen for your Mac – particularly useful if you’re stuck working from home and happen to have both a Mac and an iPad. As long as you’re on the same wifi network it works wirelessly and effortlessly, or you can use a cable.Catalina also brought expanded app support for those built using Mac Catalyst, which helps developers take their iPad apps and port them to the Mac. Twitter’s app is one example, but good ones are thin on the ground right now.The iTunes app has also been split into three apps: Apple TV, Music and Podcasts, which are generally better and faster.Various other options are available totalling to a price of £2,249 with everything maxed out.The 2020 MacBook Air has so many things going for it across form, function and sustainability.Very few machines are made with any recycled material, let alone as much as the MacBook Air. There is still some way to go to truly reduce the impact of consumer electronics on the environment, but Apple should be commended for pushing the industry forward in a similar manner to the Fairphone project.In form and function the MacBook Air is just a few shades short of the perfect traditional laptop. If you don’t want a more modern convertible, you’ll struggle to find a better consumer machine than this.The keyboard is finally as great as the trackpad, the battery lasts long enough for a work day, it’s light but strong and the screen is beautiful, while the little things such as Touch ID work great. You also get two Thunderbolt 3 ports and a long support life.Sure, the screen could have smaller bezels and the webcam could be better – why Apple hasn’t put its excellent Face ID into its laptops I have no idea. You can’t upgrade the RAM or storage after purchase, there’s no wifi 6 support, nor SD card slot or USB-A port, but by now most will have enough USB-C cables and accessories, and if not, now is the time to buy them.If you’re looking for an Apple laptop, this is the one to buy unless you need a beast such as the 16in MacBook Pro. Just spend the extra £100 and buy the MacBook Air with the Intel Core i5 processor, rather than the Core i3, at £1,099.Cons: average webcam, no wifi 6, no SD or USB-A, expensive This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

But why? Fiona Cowood investigates ...First love, first kiss, first job, first car … it’s easy to transport yourself back to those heady experiences, even though decades may have passed since they happened. Contrast that with a simple question about what you did last Wednesday … can you honestly remember?Meik Wiking runs the world’s only Happiness Research Institute in Denmark, and in his latest book, the Art of Making Memories, explores the hold that first experiences have over us.“First experiences stick better to our memories,” he says. “Several studies show that we are better at remembering the novel and the new, the extraordinary days when we did something different.” This helps to explain why, as we get older, we might have dozens of treasured memories from our youth while our present flashes by with perhaps only a house move and a holiday memory-banked for safekeeping. Wiking refers to this phenomenon as the “reminiscence bump”, AKA “the good old days” – that period from 15-30 that is the source of so many of the stories we tell about ourselves.“Firsts in my 40s are rarer than when I was 15,” says Wiking, “but that’s why I seek them out now. First experiences are able to stretch the flow of time – they can help stop the feeling that the years are going by quicker and quicker.”“When we’re out of our comfort zone, we make sure we record every aspect of the experience in case we need to retrieve the memory later on,” he says. “For example, we might not know if the situation is safe or dangerous so we open up our senses to pick up all the signs and signals.”First experiences also serve as building blocks, helping us to construct a solid sense of who we are in the world. Any parent will know how much children love being told the stories of their first steps, or their first trip to the swimming pool. Those moments are insights into identity-building, as kids make sense of how they got to where they are today. As we get older, these “firsts” become bookmarks that distinguish between chapters – who you were before a major breakup, versus who you became, for example.“Each of us has an ancient and universal human need to be seen and to be remembered,” says Wiking, “and firsts, and changes of scene, play an important role in organising autobiographical memory.”To avoid the mid-years of your life becoming a depressing blur of chores, childcare and days spent at the same desk, Wiking advocates opening yourself up to new experiences to ensure a steady imprint of new, vivid memories. Memorable grownup firsts can come in all shapes and sizes – from big, bucket-list adventures in far-flung places to practical, domestic endeavours, like hosting your first Christmas or driving your first electric car.And making these little adjustments not only enriches your own life but will positively affect others too, says Wiking. “One of my biggest ‘a-ha’ moments in writing the book was going from a perception that memory is something random that we don’t control to realising that my memory – and that of my friends and family – is actually something I can influence. Realising I can influence what my friends remember in 10 years’ time is very empowering. It makes you want to do new things – and share those experiences with others.”You’ll always remember your first EVUnlock the thrill of a game-changing first for yourself with the New Renault ZOE – the ideal first electric car.

Motoring journalist Maria McCarthy explains why they’re more than just a passing trendThere’s no doubt that this acceleration is in part being driven by increased awareness and fears about the climate crisis. But while we know that EVs are greener than traditional internal combustion engine cars, making the transition from the familiarity of fossil fuel to embracing electric can feel daunting, no matter how urgently you feel the climate emergency. Will vast amounts of number-crunching and spreadsheets be required to work out if an electric car will fit your lifestyle? Might you have to draw on vague memories of what Kws are from long-ago physics lessons? Thankfully, that won’t be necessary.“People often worry that deciding to move over to an electric car will be a chore and involve a lot of research,” says Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “But once they get started, they discover there’s lots of independent, accessible information out there, and the process can be very straightforward.”When electric cars first came on to the market, there was a lot of hand-wringing about “range anxiety” – the fear of the battery running out before you can get to a charging point. But it turns out that unless you embark on epic road trips on a regular basis, range anxiety isn’t a cause for concern. “The New Renault ZOE has a range of up to 245 miles according to WLTP testing*,” explains Rice. “And that’s plenty for most of us.”According to the Department of Transport, the average annual mileage for private cars in 2018 was 7,400 – this works out at just over 20 miles a day, so the New Renault ZOE will easily meet most people’s day-to-day needs.And when you do need to charge your battery, it’s as easy as charging your smartphone. Most electric car drivers charge at home – something made even easier by Renault, which provides a free home charge point for new retail customers purchasing a New Renault ZOE**. Once you set off with a full battery, you rarely need to top up on regular journeys. And if you do run out of juice on the go, there’s no need to panic – the UK now has more EV charging points than petrol stations (almost 10,000 locations now offer public charging points, according to Zap-Map).And best of all, the mileage costs are significantly cheaper. Costs will vary depending on your electricity tariff but, according to the Energy Saving Trust, charging an electric vehicle at home will cost on average 4-6p per mile, and 8-10p if using a public charging point. This compares with 13-16p for a petrol or diesel car.But choosing a car isn’t just about drawing up budgets – it’s about how it feels. And if you’ve never driven an electric car before then it’s time to get behind the wheel. “I find electric cars provide a versatile, relaxing drive,” says Thomas Clifton, electrification and new mobility manager at Renault. “As there’s no gear changes, they’re ideal for navigating city traffic. Then out of town, they handle just as well as a petrol or diesel car on motorways and rural roads. Forget the myth that electric cars are like driving a milk float – they give a smooth, powerful drive with great acceleration.”“If you’re curious about electric cars, then do take one for a test drive,” suggests Rice. “And don’t just try it out in town – take the New Renault ZOE out on a motorway or dual carriageway and let it show you what it can do. I would recommend asking to borrow it over night if you can and see how easily it could fit into your lifestyle.”It’s easy to put off making the switch to electric car ownership until some vague, undefined point in the future – but the truth is, there’s really no need to. If you have any reservations about the costs, charging options or drive, a little research and a test drive will quickly allay your fears. Once motorists take the plunge, they quickly become “electrical evangelists” with zero interest revisiting the dark days of internal combustion engine ownership.

Forecasts suggest a medium-term crossover point, probably towards the end of this decade, where the car industry is making more EVs than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Against that, there still exists a great deal of scepticism in the minds of consumers.“An EV wouldn’t work for me because …” is a familiar conversation starter. It’s true, there are some people for whom an electric car is simply a non-starter – but that number is a vanishingly small percentage of the population. For most, an EV is going to be a money saver that makes no obvious impact on lifestyle.Emily Rice, Renault UK’s product manager for electric cars, answers three readers’ questions.I live in a terraced house and park in the street, so I’m unable to have a home charging point. What are my charging options? Elaine Hills, BrightonAlthough it’s true that many current EV owners like to charge their cars at home using a dedicated wall-mounted charger in their driveway or garage, the good news is it’s far from the only option.The charging infrastructure to support EVs is constantly growing and evolving. For instance, it was reported in May last year that 1,076 new residential EV charging points had been installed in London as part of the Go Ultra Low City Scheme (GULCS), and this figure continues to increase. Virgin Media recently began a pilot project to convert its broadband cabinets into charging points, with a view to eventually providing 40,000 EV charging points across the UK. Elsewhere, there are initiatives such as the MK Promise, through which Milton Keynes council offers to install, within a short walk, an overnight charging point for all new EV owners lacking access to private parking.Access to a public residential charger is, however, still rare, and the much more common practice is to charge at the other end of a regular journey. “If you’d like to buy an EV, but don’t have the ability to charge it at home, check whether your workplace has charging facilities,” says Rice. “It’s common to simply not notice charging infrastructure if you don’t own an EV – but once you start thinking about switching, you really start to notice how many charging points are around you.”It’s worth noting that the notional “full charge” is an ICE hangover, driving until the warning light comes on and then filling the tank. Getting a full charge in Sainsbury’s or Starbucks may take a few hours – but with EVs such as the New Renault ZOE having a driving range of 245 miles*, it is unlikely you will need to find somewhere to charge every day, so owners aren’t arriving with the (usually metaphorical) needle in the red.If you charge an EV and then don’t use it, have you wasted your electricity? Jonathan Bailey, SheffieldThe short answer is: no. Or rather, not really. “The thing people tend to ask about is leaving their car when they go on holiday,” says Rice. “If you leave your car at the airport for a couple of weeks, you’re not going to notice a discharge. There’s lots of inbuilt technology in a Renault ZOE designed to ensure the batteries are as efficient as possible. Even if you leave your EV sitting around for a few months, it’s not going to be an issue for the traction battery.”The concern allied to this is the idea that battery performance will be less impressive as the vehicle gets older. While battery capacity can drop as the vehicle gets older – it won’t be to the extent it did a decade ago when the technology was in its infancy.“I think a lot of people worry that the battery in an EV is like the one in their phone, and they’re going to see the performance decline after a couple of years – but it really isn’t like that,” says Rice. “We all know that a phone reaches a point where you’re having to charge it a couple of times a day – but the technology in the lithium-ion battery of the car is far superior to that. If you’re driving it in the same way as a petrol or diesel car, you’re not going to experience any problems with an EV. We know it’s an area of concern, though, which is why Renault gives its EV batteries an eight-year or 100,000-mile warranty**. Hopefully that inspires confidence in the technology.”Is it more difficult to get a problem with an EV car resolved because there are fewer expert mechanics? Edward Jones, NorthamptonshireThe downside is that most of these technicians are employed by mainstream dealerships, with relatively little EV expertise in backstreet garages. EVs are, however, selling in ever-larger numbers, and mechanics are not immune to market forces. More technicians will train on EVs because, slowly but surely, that’s where the market is heading.Curious to learn more about EVs?

But I have no map, so I order the sheet I need online. I am going for a virtual walk there. No one can stop me, not even the Derbyshire constabulary.My virtual travel on maps started when I was eight and confined to my bed for six long weeks after an operation. I’d get the atlas out and trace my finger along African mountain ranges and up South American rivers, trying to imagine what those places were like (this was before David Attenborough’s Planet Earth). Years later, shivering with malaria in a Sudanese hut, I stuck the three Michelin maps that covered all of Africa on the wall and did much the same.Now, suffering another enforced confinement, I find myself going back to the static map-reading habit. I could do it all online with Open Streets or Dorset Explorer, but my internet connection is horrible and I love the big perspective that unfolded paper can give, filling the kitchen table with tantalising patches of green and yellow, lines of wriggling blue and, best of all, the darkening shadows of contour lines huddling close together.My first surprise is that the hills are a national nature reserve. The actual range does look pretty bare: an expanse of naked contour lines that vaguely resembles a dragon, snarling at Snowdonia away to the west, but prevented from leaping at its rival by the River Dee, which borders to the north and west.On the actual hills the lack of human habitation is stark, but they are high: Cadair Berwyn, the White Mountain, is marked at 827 metres (over 2,700 feet). That is where my virtual walk must go. I trace a path back from the summit to a village on the Dee, Llandrillo, where there is a campsite marked. That is where I will sleep the night before. I allow myself a Google search and discover that there is a pub, the Dudley Arms.But now I am distracted by the map. Over the river from the campsite there is a cairn circle, then heading upriver I find an ancient bridge, Pont Cilan (square bridge?), a little further there is a “motte” (maybe a ruined castle?) and several islands. In my mind’s eye I see myself slipping a canoe into the river on a summer night and paddling across. Annoyingly, a salmon leaps into the boat and begs to be pan-fried over a camp fire while I sample some Welsh whisky.I give up this fantasy and return to the mountain walk. From the camp I head east up a small wooded valley containing the Afon Lynor (river). After two miles I emerge from the trees and walk up to a memorial stone (to who?) and take a permissive path south. I’m now climbing on to the ridge that leads first to Cadair Bronwen and then Berwyn itself. The presence of grouse butts suggests I’ll hear the grumpy croak of those birds.The ridge looks impressive with a 200-metre drop on both sides, steeper on the east side. Once again I am distracted. What does Bwrdd Arthur mean? My Welsh-speaker helps out, again: Arthur’s Table. This is plainly an ancient landscape: just beyond the next peak, Moel Sych (Bare Dry peak?) I find a stone circle, a cairn and a stone row, all in close proximity. I follow the path down into a valley and see there’s a marked waterfall, Pistyll Rhaeadr, which rings a bell. I’ve been there, 20 years ago, and remember a cafe. Lunch. The falls are 80 metres high and well worth a visit.I’ve done about 10 miles, I reckon, but I’m determined to keep going as the next shoulder of hill has a tumulus and a fort, before dipping down past more waterfalls through the village of Llangynog, where I cross the River Tanat and take the Melangell Path. At the head of this valley is a place I have heard about but never seen, a chapel dedicated to the hare, the long-eared fleet-footed variety. This being a virtual walk I still feel full of energy, despite the 16 miles, and press on up the hill, yomping the nine miles back to the campsite in record time. The Dudley Arms in Llandrillo, a mile short of the campsite, beckons for a well-deserved pint.I fold up my OS255 and put it on top of the pile, ready, I hope, for later this year.

I also want to apologize directly to Captain Crozier, his family, and the entire crew of the Theodore Roosevelt for any pain my remarks may have caused.”Modly sparked a leadership crisis at the Pentagon when an audio recording surfaced of a speech he gave to the crew of the aircraft carrier, in which he denigrated the commander he had fired for having circulated a memo calling for more help for his crew, who had been stricken by a coronavirus outbreak onboard. The acting navy secretary’s apology came soon after Donald Trump said on Monday evening he would intervene in the situation, and hinted he might reinstate the former Roosevelt commander Captain Brett Crozier.“His career prior to that was very good. So I’m going to get involved and see exactly what’s going on there because I don’t want to destroy somebody for having a bad day,” Trump said, while stressing that Crozier should not have circulated the memo.Referring to Modly and Crozier, the president added: “Two good people ... they were arguing. And I’m good, believe it or not, at settling arguments … So I may look into it in great detail. And I’ll be able to figure it out very fast.”In the recording of Modly’s speech on board the Roosevelt, published by the Task \u0026amp Purpose military news website, heckling can be heard from the crew during the speech, which was otherwise greeted with silence.Modly justified his decision to relieve Capt Crozier of command last week, on the grounds that his four-page memo requesting more help for his crew, and asking for them to be moved on shore at Guam, had been circulated to more than 40 people. It was leaked to the San Francisco Chronicle, but Modly did not accuse Crozier of the leak.“If he didn’t think that information was going to get out into the public in this information age that we live in, then he was a too naive or too stupid to be the commanding officer of a ship like this,” Modly said.In his apology on Monday night, Modly said: “I believe, precisely because he is not naive or stupid, that he sent his alarming email with the intention of getting it into the public domain in an effort to draw public attention to the situation on his ship.”During Mody’s speech on Sunday, someone (presumably a crew member) can be heard yelling “What the fuck?” Crozier was a popular captain and video circulated on Friday of the crew massing on the deck of the Roosevelt to cheer and chant the captain’s name as he left the ship, walking down the gangplank to a waiting car.Modly criticised the crew for cheering, saying that they should think of the people of Guam, who were concerned about being infected by sick sailors brought ashore. He attacked the media, which he said were seeking to embarrass the navy, and accused Crozier of betrayal.“Everyone’s scared about this thing. But I tell you something – if this ship was in combat and there were hypersonic missiles coming at it, you’d be pretty fucking scared too,” he said, to a shout of “Whoa!” from the crew. “But you do your jobs.”At least four Democratic members of Congress and an independent, Justin Lamash, called for Modly’s immediate resignation.“Modly should be removed unceremoniously for these shocking remarks – especially after failing to protect sailors’ safety \u0026amp health. He has betrayed their trust,” Senator Richard Blumenthal said on Twitter, calling for a Pentagon investigation.David Lapan, a former Pentagon spokesman and ex-marine, tweeted: “These remarks to sailors are unbefitting a senior leader and will only increase isiveness in the ranks. He has failed as a leader \u0026amp should resign.”After the recording of his speech was published, Modly issued a statement saying he had not listened to the recording but that “the spoken words were from the heart”.“I stand by every word I said, even, regrettably any profanity that may have been used for emphasis,” he said.Modly became acting secretary in November after the former navy secretary Richard Spencer was fired for dissenting from Trump’s attempt to exonerate a navy seal, Eddie Gallagher, who had been accused of war crimes and was demoted after being found guilty of posing with the corpse of an Islamic State fighter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46c6e9ab05e72181b7097d7ed78a5d7591fd8410/0_351_5270_3162/master/5270..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8890bfa24cae9f9dd55cf18c3876c696","title":"iranian official backtracks after calling chinese covid 19 figures a joke","story":"Comments from Kianoush Jahanpour draw reproach from Chinese ambassadorIran’s health ministry spokesman has backtracked after he described China’s official figures on the coronavirus outbreak as a “joke”.Kianoush Jahanpour made the remarks at a press conference and a tweet on Sunday, adding that China had given the impression that coronavirus was like influenza but with fewer deaths.Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start.\u0026nbspEven if it means they\u0027re at home for longer than 14 days.If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.Staying at home means you should:You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise – but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the\u0026nbspNHS 111 coronavirus service\u0026nbspto find out what to do.His tweet led led to a reproach from the Chinese ambassador to Iran, Chang Hua, who said China’s health ministry had held a press conference every day. “I suggest that you read their news very carefully in order to draw conclusions,” the ambassador said.Chinese-Iranian relations are normally warm, partly because China is a key market for Iranian oil, and criticism of China’s coronavirus figures had previously come exclusively from the west.Jahanpour said he had merely been commenting on how China’s epidemiological assessment of coronavirus was not shared by Iran.After Chinese representations to the Iranian foreign ministry, Jahanpour, a familiar face on Iranian TV, said on Monday: “We should also see the glass half full. At the very least, we all decided that we had to respect principles of diplomacy.”Meanwhile, Iran announced plans to ban printed newspapers in an effort to slow the spread of the disease. Editors of seven titles including the reformist Etemad and Ebtekar protested against the decision, saying it represented a further incursion of press freedom and would bankrupt them.Alireza Zali, the commander-in-chief of the anti-coronavirus HQ in Tehran, said: “Especially in Tehran province, we have witnessed a very serious change in the presence and movement of people in cities, and unfortunately, at a time when we are witnessing this increase in motor traffic, the numbers entering Tehran’s hospitals is still increasing.”Iran said on Monday that its death toll from coronavirus had risen to 3,739, an increase of 136 in the past 24 hours, and a total of 60,500 people had been infected, up 2,274 since the previous day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb31bd26cdc4732dce2a58219053448017fe2838/0_256_5000_3001/master/5000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e057d2fd56077feb258950811da5b9e","title":"japan poised to declare state of emergency over coronavirus","story":"Country had avoided large number of cases and deaths but there is growing alarm over rise in infections in capitalJapan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is poised to declare a state of emergency in Tokyo and six other prefectures as early as Tuesday in an attempt to stem a sharp rise in coronavirus cases in the capital and other major cities.The measure, to go into effect for about a month, will enable local authorities to urge people to stay at home except to shop for food, seek medical care, go to work if necessary, and take daily exercise.“We hope to declare a state of emergency as early as tomorrow after listening to the opinions of the advisory panel,” Abe told reporters on Monday evening.“We are seeing rapid increases of new infections, particularly in urban areas such as Tokyo and Osaka.“Considering that medical institutions are facing a critical situation, I have received opinions that the government should prepare to declare a state of emergency.”Abe’s apparent reluctance to implement tougher measures earlier in the crisis had drawn criticism from the Japan Medical Association and Yuriko Koike, the governor of Tokyo, where confirmed cases have surged in the past week.Japan has avoided the large number of Covid-19 cases and deaths that have prompted lockdowns in other countries, but there is growing alarm over the rise in infections in the capital, particularly among young people.Tokyo reported a record 148 new cases on Sunday, with a further 83 on Monday taking its total to over 1,000, according to the public broadcaster NHK. The majority of confirmed cases over the weekend involved people aged below 50, with many in their 20s and 30s.More than 3,500 people have tested positive and 85 have died from the virus in Japan, NHK said. While the figures are low compared to the US, China and parts of Europe, officials are concerned that a surge in infections could place intolerable strain on the country’s hospitals.The declaration will allow the governors of Japan’s 47 prefectures to call on people to stay at home and businesses to close, but they will not have the legal authority to impose the kind of lockdowns seen in other countries, or to fine residents who ignore the request.“If you ask me if we can enforce a lockdown like France, the answer is no,” Abe told MPs last week.He is also expected to unveil “unprecedented” stimulus measures in response to the “biggest crisis” the global economy has faced since the second world war, according to a draft document.The 108 trillion yen (£800bn) package, which has yet to be finalised, would be much bigger than the country’s response in the wake of the 2009 financial crisis.Koike has voiced concern over the high number of untraced cases and growing pressure on the city’s hospitals, and supports a “soft” lockdown to protect the city’s 14 million residents.Legal revisions passed last month gave Abe scope to declare a state of emergency if the coronavirus outbreak posed a “grave danger” to public health and threatened serious damage to the world’s third-biggest economy, which is now on the brink of recession.Officials are hoping peer pressure will encourage people to stay at home and to practise social distancing when they go out. Businesses that refuse to cooperate face being publicly named and shamed.In addition, local leaders will be able to requisition facilities to use as temporary medical centres and order the closure of schools and other gathering places such as theatres, music venues and stadiums. Most of the country’s schools have been closed for more than a month following a request by Abe.His declaration is initially expected to target the greater Tokyo metropolitan area – with a population of more than 36 million – along with Osaka and five other areas.Under the declaration, hospitals will be able to transfer people with mild symptoms to specially designated hotels to free up medical facilities for more serious cases, local media reported.Abe has faced accusations that he and other officials started seriously addressing the outbreak only after it became inevitable that the Olympics, initially due to be held in Tokyo this summer, would have to be postponed.Schools and many other public facilities have been closed for a month, and some companies are allowing employees to work from home, but calls to avoid socialising at bars and restaurants have failed to resonate.Citing evidence of infection clusters in entertainment districts, Koike has urged residents to stay at home for the past two weekends and to avoid crowded places until 12 April.The message appeared to have got through this weekend, with several restaurant chains and shops, along with the capital’s ubiquitous pachinko and karaoke parlours, closing their doors. Rail and subway operators are also reporting dramatic falls in passenger numbers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c75ba20b85a44b7ca56ad4df858f2c39c753ae2a/0_0_3431_2059/master/3431..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=472c6ae8b58c55ece5ee822d8f94ce89","title":"ministers seeking to smear civil servants over coronavirus handling","story":"FDA union says ‘cowardly’ briefings show some in government putting self-preservation firstMinisters have been accused of focusing on saving their careers instead of the lives of coronavirus victims by authorising “cowardly and shameful” anonymous briefings against some of the UK’s most senior public officials.Smears by unnamed Downing Street sources against Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, and Public Health England (PHE) executives show that “some within government are still putting self-preservation first”, according to the head of the senior civil servants’ union.It comes amid concern across Whitehall that cabinet ministers and their special advisers are mounting a concerted effort to pass the blame for the UK’s faltering response to the pandemic on to officials.Government sources were quoted this weekend claiming that Sedwill had failed to get a grip of government, PHE officials had not placed enough emphasis on testing and NHS England officials had failed to control personal protective equipment (PPE) supply.In an article for the , Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA union, which represents the UK’s most senior public servants, said some in government were ignoring the dedication of public servants and instead using them as scapegoats.“As pressure mounts over the capacity for coronavirus testing and the supply of PPE and ventilators, finding someone to blame rather than fixing the problem seems to be the priority for some at the heart of government,” said Penman. “Well-placed anonymous sources have started pointing fingers at everyone from the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, to Public Health England.“If mistakes have been made, ministers and civil servants will rightly be held accountable … While ministers and officials must be scrutinised for their decisions as events unfold, many of these questions will inevitably be for another day.“Right now, we need ministers and their advisers focusing on saving lives, not their careers. While public servants across the UK are working night and day – literally putting their lives on the line for the country – some within government are still putting self-preservation first. It is not only cowardly and shameful, it’s also destructive.”A Times article on Saturday quoted an ally of Johnson saying that Sedwill was under scrutiny for failing to control government departments. “He’s more present now but there is a bit of a mystery about where he was in the early days of all this,” the source was quoted as saying.The same article claimed that ministers were blaming PHE officials for an inflexible attitude and insensitivity to public pressure for answers. “What this has exposed is these people’s utter lack of accountability,” a senior official told the newspaper. “It’s not just PHE, it’s a whole world of these bodies that bumble along, occasionally banning Coco Pops or something but for the most part entirely out of sight.”In a following article, a “senior figure” told the Sunday Times that NHS England was being blamed by ministers for failing to get a grip on PPE supply.Civil servants have also been angered this weekend by claims that the prime minister is “extremely unlikely” to sack the home secretary, Priti Patel, even if she is found to have bullied civil servants across three separate government departments.The Cabinet Office investigation was launched last month after claims from civil servants and the resignation of Sir Philip Rutnam, the Home Office’s most senior official.Sir Alex Allan, the prime minister’s independent adviser on ministers’ interests, is expected to pass on the findings within days.He will decide whether Patel broke rules. However, the final say rests with Johnson, who can overrule Allan.Rutnam, who resigned after anonymous briefings against him in the media, is suing the government for constructive dismissal after accusing Patel of “swearing and belittling people”.As well as witnessing Patel’s alleged bullying behaviour, Rutnam claimed he was briefed against across the media by sources said to be from either No 10 or friends or allies of Patel. He was accused of being unable to do his job and of being undeserving of his pension, and was compared to the Winnie the Pooh character Eeyore.Patel has denied the claims.One Whitehall source said: “If Patel is cleared without a thorough inquiry into the many claims of bullying, it will be seen as a whitewash and will heighten mistrust across government.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a12ceeb62225a72298e67a5770e8d24114022bcd/0_102_3072_1843/master/3072..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ca1a2a7b581298558d482fdd8d41c4f","title":"self isolate mystery dalek orders humans in the age of coronavirus","story":"Amid the coronavirus crisis, police and pranksters around the world are helping to spread good cheerIn difficult times, people are turning to all sorts of creative methods to bring joy (and a little bit of friendly fear) to those around them.The public have been warned tougher measures will have to be implemented if people do not adhere to physical distancing rules, but no one expected it to come in the form of extraterrestrial villains.Residents of Robin Hood’s Bay, near Whitby, were surprised to see a Dalek patrolling the streets telling people to stay indoors.“By order of the Daleks, all humans must stay indoors, all humans must self-isolate,” the Doctor Who villain screeched as it zoomed along the street.It is unclear who is behind the creative stunt, which some found amusing, but it brought back scary memories for many fans of the long-running sci-fi series.One Twitter user wrote: “Am I the only one to feel a genuine shiver of fear watching this? As a child I would most certainly have been hiding behind the sofa. And if a Cyberman came marching down the road, that would be it, I’d be running for my life!”Tayside police in Scotland shared the video, saying: “Our colleagues in Skaro ision have deployed their Direct Action Local Enforcement Kops to ensure everyone is following guidelines about isolation and social distancing.”Grace Cooper came up with the idea as a way of keeping busy during the lockdown, and, after her mum issued a callout for names on Facebook, they were soon inundated.She has carefully written each name on a love heart, around a sign that reads: “Not all heroes wear capes.”Grace said: “It’s to thank all the key workers for going out and risking their lives to save us. I want them all to know they are appreciated and we are grateful to them.”Her mother, Lauren Liggatt, told the Derbyshire Times: “We’ve got hundreds of names now and I’ve got a huge pile which I need to put up. We’ve filled one window are now moving on to another one.“Grace is really pleased with it and I am so proud of her. She said she wanted to thank the people who are working to keep us safe and well, and that is so nice of her.”A four-year-old boy whose birthday celebrations were cancelled because of the coronavirus lockdown was treated to a visit from a local police officer who stopped by to lift his spirits on the big day.Dexter Lee should have been celebrating his birthday on holiday with his family but the trip had to be cancelled when the lockdown came into force.Unable to see any of his friends or family on the special day, Dexter’s mum, Anna, asked if anyone knew of a police officer who could cheer up her son, who wants to join the force when he is older, with a special wave as they drove past.People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.To her surprise, Sgt Mark Wilson from Merseyside police, along with the force mascot, Bobby, turned up with a goody bag and a superhero card from Ch Con Andy Cooke especially for Dexter.Dexter and his big brother, Freddie, even got to sit in the police van, while their grandparents watched from their cars, which were parked nearby.“The most we were hoping for was for a police officer to drive by and flash the sirens. We are so overwhelmed by the effort the police went to today. It has brought a lot of cheer to us and the whole neighbourhood,” Dexter’s parents said.Hundreds of travellers are still stranded around the world after coronavirus lockdowns came into force – but one honeymooning couple ended up better off than most.Surrounded by a fleet of staff catering to their every need on a luxury Malian resort, Olivia and Raul De Freitas have found themselves on an eternal honeymoon.Arriving at the Cinnamon Velifushi Males resort on 22 March for what was supposed to be a six-night stay, the newlyweds were soon the only two guests left when their home country, South Africa, closed its airports in response to the pandemic and they were unable to leave.The resort, which hosts up to 180 guests, continued to put on a full performance in the dining hall each night for the pair while nine staff members remained on standby.Room service checked on them five times a day, while other workers treated the couple to an elaborate candlelit dinner on the beach, they told the New York Times.They were told they would have to hire a chartered jet with other South Africans stuck in the Males in order to get home. But, at a cost of a $104,000, they decided to stay put.They have now been transferred to another luxury resort, along with other South Africans in the region, with a large proportion of their costs subsidised. However, their return date remains unknown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5eb6002329c9dc9fe5ec685db64d6e60f400a30/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3810f3daebd2ac24c07ccfdec5cc526","title":"seven year old greek piano prodigy pens an isolation waltz","story":"Stelios Kerasidis says his latest work is ‘for people who suffer and isolate because of Covid-19’Move over Mozart, here comes Stelios Kerasidis. A seven-year-old Greek prodigy has penned an “isolation waltz” inspired by the pandemic. The hypnotic, fugue-like melody has picked up more than 43,000 hits on YouTube since its launch last week.“Hi guys! I’m Stelios. Let’s be just a teeny bit more patient and we will soon be out swimming in the sea,” he beams, perched on his piano stool, feet barely touching the floor. “I’m dedicating to you a piece of my own.”The work, his third composition, was written especially “for people who suffer and those who isolate because of Covid-19,” he adds.Born in Athens in 2012 to Fotis and Agathe Kerasidis, both pianists who now teach him, Stelios first performed in public at the age of three. In 2018 he played Chopin’s Waltz in A Minor at New York’s Carnegie Hall, and last year he appeared at London’s Royal Albert Hall performing on Elton John’s famous red piano.Stelios says his favourite pianist is the late Canadian Glenn Gould, best known for his technically demanding renditions of Bach variations.The Greek has shown a flare for composing. His two earlier works were written for his sisters, Veronica and Anastasia, and like Isolation Waltz were met with critical acclaim.Greece has been under lockdown for longer than most other European nations, the government having closed schools almost a month ago. Last week the government announced that swimming was also forbidden as the measures were ramped up.The precautionary steps appear to be working: Greece has reported 79 deaths and fewer than 1,800 confirmed coronavirus cases, far fewer than some other countries. Stelios, who is likely to be homebound for some time yet, has not hinted whether he has another composition up his sleeve.

Here she tells the story of her first two hours of freedomOn 24 March, the Hubei coronavirus prevention and control department announced that starting from midnight on 8 April, people would be allowed to leave Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province. Transport links to the outside will be restored and people with a green “health code” will be able to leave.Seeing this news, I was not very excited. First, my residential compound was still under lockdown. Secondly, the situation of the epidemic has improved but the aftermath and the disaster caused by this epidemic still continues.How do we remember the people who died? How do we help those damaged by the virus? How do we improve the situation for Hubei people who are now discriminated against? Many businesses have gone bankrupt, and people have lost jobs – how can we ensure their livelihoods? All these questions require the government and society to face the truth and take responsibility. But so far, we have not seen a comprehensive policy announced.On the evening of 30 March, a volunteer in my compound said they had spoken to the security guard and that residents with a green health code could now go out to buy supplies. I was so excited, I burst into tears. I quickly registered for the health code on Alipay and got ready to go out the next day. The last time I left my home was 26 February. It had already been 43 days.On 31 March at 11:35am, I walked out of my compound. (Each household can have one person leave, for a maximum of two hours.) Stepping out of my compound, I didn’t have any special plans, I was just so eager to see this city again with my own eyes.A lot of stores had not yet reopened but there were more than before: supermarkets, convenience stores, small noodle shops, electronics stores, shopping malls and so on.Because I could only stay out for two hours, I was a little flustered and had trouble taking clear photos. I passed by a store selling Wuhanese snacks and bought 10 fried meatballs for 21 yuan ($3).As part of the lockdown, a lot of places have been fenced off, including stores along the street and alleyway entrances, or gates to the riverbank. These shops are like urban villages – the residents don’t live in formal residential compounds with management services or a courtyard. Most of their homes are small – and they have had to stay in for more than 40 days, some of them even more than 60 days.Someone once asked me: “What is the first thing you will do after the lockdown?” I said: “Walk along the river and shout.” So on this day, I headed toward the river.I cycled to the entrance and then walked along the bank. There were more people now. There were parents with their kids, couples, people fishing. I found a seat, took off my face mask and in one breath ate five of the meatballs. They were juicy but not greasy. The flavour was just right.After I finished eating, I walked along the riverside. I hesitated a little and then facing the river I yelled: “Ahhhh!” Two other voices joined me. One of them even shouted three times. We have all been trapped for too long. We have been suffocated. I shouted a few more times. I felt energised.The two hours passed quickly. At 1pm I began walking back from the river. I bought a carton of yogurt from a small super market next to my compound. At 1:32pm, I went back home.Being able to leave our neighbourhood compound is one small step. Bringing the city back to life is still a long way away. Globalisation has shortened the distance between people and connected them – but it has also led to the explosion of this epidemic around the world.Many of the new cases in China now are imported infections, which could lead to a second outbreak. To face the epidemic, people must take protective measures and the government must treat those who are infected. All I want is to not go through another lockdown.Guo Jing, 29, is a women’s rights advocate in Wuhan and author of Wuhan Lockdown Diary.Translated by Wu Pei Lin and Lily Kuo"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1e2a52b60800f4c5d312487b0ed01ee2b72a7fc/0_0_5000_3001/master/5000..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26aa1b19aaa91a7954cdc406b44c2fe8","title":"coronavirus global leaders urge g20 to tackle twin health and economic crises","story":"Letter calls for $8bn emergency fund to bolster health systems in world’s poorer countriesA group of 165 global leaders has called for immediate and coordinated international action to tackle the twin health and economic emergencies caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.Past and present politicians – including three former UK prime ministers – joined academics and civil society representatives to warn the G20 that the virus will return unless urgent action is taken to bolster health systems in poor countries of Africa and Latin America.Amid concerns that the fight against Covid-19 is being hampered by a lack of united action by the body that represents leading developed and developing nations, the global leaders said $8bn (£6.4bn) of emergency health funding should be approved to prevent a second wave of infection.A letter from the group urged the G20 to set up a taskforce with executive powers to help coordinate the fight against Covid-19.It called for debt relief for the poorest countries and an increase in the funds available to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.“We are writing to call for immediate internationally coordinated action – within the next few days – to address our deepening global health and economic crises from Covid-19” the letter says.It adds: “In 2008-10, the immediate economic crisis could be surmounted when the economic fault line – under-capitalisation of the global banking system – was tackled. Now, however, the economic emergency will not be resolved until the health emergency is effectively addressed: the health emergency will not end simply by conquering the disease in one country alone, but by ensuring recovery from Covid-19 in all countries.”The letter was signed by, among others, Gordon Brown, Tony Blair and John Major, the former president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, the former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd, the former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, the former UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon, financier George Soros and the nobel prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz.The letter said that in addition to the $8bn of emergency health spending, developing countries would need $150bn to fight the twin medical and economic challenges.Both the IMF and the World Bank have been urging creditor countries to defer interest payments on bilateral poor-country debt this year, saving them $14bn, but the group of 165 leaders said the international community should go further and agree a more generous package, worth $44bn to Africa alone.The IMF and the World Bank will hold spring meetings by teleconference, with finance ministers discussing plans to beef up the financial resources of the two Washington-based organisations.The letter to the G20 said the IMF needed an additional $500-600bn in the form of special drawing rights: a form of international currency that can be used to increase the reserves of member states. Extra funds would also be needed to help the World Bank meet demands for help.Citing research by Imperial College London, the letter said 1.2 million Covid-19 deaths were possible in Africa and Asia’s poorest countries.It said even the best funded health systems were struggling to cope with the pandemic. “Yet, if we do nothing as the disease spreads in poorer African, Asian and Latin American cities and in fragile communities which have little testing equipment, ventilators and medical supplies and where social distancing and even washing hands are difficult to achieve, Covid-19 will persist there and re-emerge to hit the rest of the world with further rounds that will prolong the crisis.”It added: “Much has been done by national governments to counter the downward slide of their economies. But a global economic problem requires a global economic response.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance 7 april","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:Global infections stand at more than 1.347m, with deaths at 74,892. The US now has more than 368,000 cases and close to 11,000 deaths and the UK has more than 52,000 cases and close to 5,400 deaths.The British prime minister was moved to intensive care on Monday night after his condition worsened. Donald Trump paid tribute to Johnson at his daily White House briefing, calling him a “fantastic warm strong smart guy” who “fought like hell for his country. But intensive care is big stuff, really big stuff.” Australia’s prime minister Scott Morrison sent his good wishes, saying: “We’re with you mate, and we hope you get better soon.” The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, will run the country’s coronavirus response in Johnson’s absence.The country reported no coronavirus-related deaths for the first time since it began publishing daily data on the pandemic in January. The good news came as the Chinese city of Wuhan is preparing to reopen transport out of the city tomorrow.Prime minister Shinzo Abe is expected to declare a state of emergency in Japan in the coming hours. The move comes after several major regions saw a sharp rise in coronavirus cases, especially in the capital Tokyo.The governors of New York and New Jersey pointed to tentative signs on Monday that the coronavirus outbreak was starting to plateau but warned against complacency as the nationwide death toll approached 11,000 in the US, with more than 366,000 confirmed cases.Australia’s prime minister Scott Morrison has told citizens to stay home for Easter, as data showed the country’s infection curve was being bent in the right direction. The country has 5,844 cases and 45 deaths from the virus. But the rate of increase in daily cases has dropped over the last week.The country reported a fourth consecutive drop in the number of coronavirus-related deaths on Monday, with 637 dead over the past 24 hours, the lowest number in nearly two weeks.Dr David Clark, the country’s health minister, has been demoted for flouting the country’s strict lockdown rules, after he revealed he had driven 20km with his family to go to the beach. This follows an incident last week in which Clark apologised for driving 2km from his home to go mountain biking. Clark again apologised for being “an idiot” and offered his resignation. He retains the health ministry for now, but has been demoted within Cabinet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab356414344fb08f342a3c72ca10fc7facccd1cf/0_298_5568_3341/master/5568..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c9c1e3a6744fe33c7cb053706b13828","title":"we are very afraid scramble contain coronavirus mumbai slum dharavi","story":"Fears disease could ‘spread like wildfire’ in the incredibly congested slum of DharaviIt was the news that many in India had feared. A 56-year-old man who lived in Dharavi, India’s largest slum, where almost 1 million people are densely packed together in a 2 sq km area in Mumbai, had tested positive for coronavirus. He died shortly after.It has prompted a scramble by local authorities to halt the virus before it takes hold in this overcrowded, unsanitary enclave, which was the inspiration for Danny Boyle’s film Slumdog Millionaire.But the prospect of attempting to contain transmission in a place where 10 people often live in a single room, more than 80 people share a public toilet and where many houses do not even have running water is already proving daunting to local officials. So far there are five known cases in Dharavi, while 25 people have been taken into special quarantine facilities and another 3,500 placed under home quarantine.“We are doing everything we can to make sure it does not explode and that there is no community spread, but it is a big challenge to contain this,” said Kiran Dighavkar, the assistant municipal commissioner for G-North ward of Mumbai.It appears that the 56-year-old garment worker who was the slum’s first victim had made two trips to the local Lokmanya Tilak municipal general hospital over the course of a week, presenting first with a fever and then severe respiratory problems, before he was tested by doctors. With no foreign travel history, he had not been considered high risk. But on 29 March, he tested positive for the virus and died four days later.There was initial confusion over how this man, who had never been abroad and lived with seven family members in a small flat adjacent to Dharavi, could possibly have contracted the virus. Yet while his family were initially uncooperative, it later emerged he had hosted several men who had attended a religious gathering of the Tablighi Jamaat sect of Islam in Delhi several weeks ago, which has since been linked to hundreds of coronavirus cases across India.The response by the authorities was swift. The area where the victim had lived was sealed off and remains so, and his family was taken into quarantine and all those in the building, or who were considered high risk, have been tested. A new 51-bed hospital in the Dharavi area, specifically to treat coronavirus patients, has also been acquired, with eight intensive care beds, though it is feared if the virus takes hold this will not be nearly enough.Other cases in the slum include a 30-year-old woman with no foreign travel history, and authorities are searching for the dozens who attended her birthday party a week ago.“There are already many health issues in Dharavi,” said Dighavkar, who added that one of the main obstacles in tackling the spread of coronavirus was a social stigma that prevented people from coming forward with symptoms.“But we are hopeful that they have good immunity because they have been exposed to many viruses, especially through using the community toilet, so we are hoping that if we find the high-risk contacts and put them in quarantine, we will be able to control it.”Babbu Khan, a municipal councillor in Dharavi, said he feared many more people were already infected and warned that undetected cases could “wreak havoc” in the slum, where the disease was likely to “spread like wildfire”.“For the slum-dwellers it is very difficult to stay safe from a coronavirus-infected neighbour in this incredibly congested slum of Dharavi,” said Khan. “When five people have already tested positive for the virus, there must be many more people around who are already infected. We know that many people carrying the virus remain asymptomatic, but still continue to spread the infection.”Overall Mumbai has one of the highest concentrations of coronavirus cases in the country and on Monday, three doctors and 26 nurses of Wockhardt hospital in Mumbai tested positive, bringing the total number of cases in the state of Maharashtra to 809.Within Dharavi, fear has already begun to take hold. Mohammad Shafi Alam Shaikh, 53, who trades in school bags and lives in the MP Nagar area of Dharavi along with his wife and four children, said many people were very scared about the “new disease”.“Many of my neighbours are very nervous and staying indoors,” he said. “They are coming out of their homes only to use public toilets. All of them say that it is very difficult to escape the infection in such congested slums. They all are afraid of being infected.”Many mosques in the slum are using their public announcement system to spread awareness about Covid-19. But Shaikh said most of the advised measures for hand-washing and social distancing were an impossibility for the people of Dharavi.“Many people do not have food at home and so in search of provisions and food handouts, people are being forced to stay outside their homes for a long time. At places like ration shops and free food delivery points people are still gathering in big numbers,” said Shaikh. “So we are very afraid of a fast spread of the virus.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bda74d598f84abf4e4f682650ea6f7059d43a44b/0_195_4368_2621/master/4368..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a6ee343364cce21bc2aacae7aa7151e","title":"what coronavirus can teach us about hope rebecca solnit","story":"In the midst of fear and isolation, we are learning that profound, positive change is possible. By  Rebecca SolnitDisasters begin suddenly and never really end. The future will not, in crucial ways, be anything like the past, even the very recent past of a month or two ago. Our economy, our priorities, our perceptions will not be what they were at the outset of this year. The particulars are startling: companies such as GE and Ford retooling to make ventilators, the scramble for protective gear, once-bustling city streets becoming quiet and empty, the economy in freefall. Things that were supposed to be unstoppable stopped, and things that were supposed to be impossible – extending workers’ rights and benefits, freeing prisoners, moving a few trillion dollars around in the US – have already happened.The word “crisis” means, in medical terms, the crossroads a patient reaches, the point at which she will either take the road to recovery or to death. The word “emergency” comes from “emergence” or “emerge”, as if you were ejected from the familiar and urgently need to reorient. The word “catastrophe” comes from a root meaning a sudden overturning.We have reached a crossroads, we have emerged from what we assumed was normality, things have suddenly overturned. One of our main tasks now – especially those of us who are not sick, are not frontline workers, and are not dealing with other economic or housing difficulties – is to understand this moment, what it might require of us, and what it might make possible.A disaster (which originally meant “ill-starred”, or “under a bad star”) changes the world and our view of it. Our focus shifts, and what matters shifts. What is weak breaks under new pressure, what is strong holds, and what was hidden emerges. Change is not only possible, we are swept away by it. We ourselves change as our priorities shift, as intensified awareness of mortality makes us wake up to our own lives and the preciousness of life. Even our definition of “we” might change as we are separated from schoolmates or co-workers, sharing this new reality with strangers. Our sense of self generally comes from the world around us, and right now, we are finding another version of who we are.As the pandemic upended our lives, people around me worried that they were having trouble focusing and being productive. It was, I suspected, because we were all doing other, more important work. When you’re recovering from an illness, pregnant or young and undergoing a growth spurt, you’re working all the time, especially when it appears you’re doing nothing. Your body is growing, healing, making, transforming and labouring below the threshold of consciousness. As we struggled to learn the science and statistics of this terrible scourge, our psyches were doing something equivalent. We were adjusting to the profound social and economic changes, studying the lessons disasters teach, equipping ourselves for an unanticipated world.The first lesson a disaster teaches is that everything is connected. In fact, disasters, I found while living through a medium-sized one (the 1989 earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area) and later writing about major ones (including 911, Hurricane Katrina and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and Fukushima nuclear catastrophe in Japan), are crash courses in those connections. At moments of immense change, we see with new clarity the systems – political, economic, social, ecological – in which we are immersed as they change around us. We see what’s strong, what’s weak, what’s corrupt, what matters and what doesn’t.I often think of these times as akin to a spring thaw: it’s as if the pack ice has broken up, the water starts flowing again and boats can move through places they could not during winter. The ice was the arrangement of power relations that we call the status quo – it seems to be stable, and those who benefit from it often insist that it’s unchangeable. Then it changes fast and dramatically, and that can be exhilarating, terrifying, or both.Those who benefit most from the shattered status quo are often more focused on preserving or reestablishing it than protecting human life – as we saw when a chorus of US conservatives and corporate top dogs insisted that, for the sake of the stock market, everyone had to go back to work, and that the resultant deaths would be an acceptable price to pay. In a crisis, the powerful often try to seize more power – as they have in this round, with the Trump Department of Justice looking at suspending constitutional rights – and the rich seek more riches: two Republican senators are under fire for allegedly using inside information about the coming pandemic to make a profit in the stock market (although both have denied wrongdoing).Disaster scholars use the term “elite panic” to describe the ways that elites react when they assume that ordinary people will behave badly. When elites describe “panic” and “looting” in the streets, these are usually misnomers for ordinary people doing what they need to do to survive or care for others. Sometimes it’s wise to move rapidly from danger sometimes it’s altruistic to gather supplies to share.Such elites often prioritise profit and property over human life and community. In the days after a huge earthquake struck San Francisco on 18 April 1906, the US military swarmed over the city, convinced that ordinary people were a threat and a source of disorder. The mayor issued a “shoot to kill” proclamation against looters, and the soldiers believed they were restoring order. What they were actually doing was setting inexpert firebreaks that helped fire spread through the city, and shooting or beating citizens who disobeyed orders (sometimes those orders were to let the fires burn down their own homes and neighbourhoods). Ninety-nine years later, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans’s police and white vigilantes did the same thing: shooting black people in the name of defending property and their own authority. The local, state and federal government insisted on treating a stranded, mostly poor, mostly black population as dangerous enemies to be contained and controlled, rather than victims of a catastrophe to be aided.The mainstream media colluded in obsessing about looting in the aftermath of Katrina. The stock of mass-manufactured goods in large corporate chain stores seemed to matter more than people needing food and clean water, or grandmothers left clinging to roofs. Nearly 1,500 people died of a disaster that had more to do with bad government than with bad weather. The US Army Corps of Engineers’ levees had failed the city had no evacuation plans for the poor, and President George W Bush’s administration failed to deliver prompt and effective relief. The same calculus is happening now. A member of the Brazilian opposition said of Brazil’s rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro: “He represents the most perverse economic interests that couldn’t care less about people’s lives. They’re worried about maintaining their profitability.” (Bolsonaro claims he is trying to protect workers and the economy.)The billionaire evangelist who owns the arts and crafts chain Hobby Lobby claimed ine guidance in keeping his workers at their jobs when businesses were ordered to close. (The company has now closed all its stores.) At Uline Corporation, owned by billionaire Trump backers Richard and Liz Uihlein, a memo sent to Wisconsin workers said: “please do NOT tell your peers about the symptoms \u0026amp your assumptions. By doing so, you are causing unnecessary panic in the office.” The billionaire founder and chairman of payroll processing corporation Paychex, Tom Golisano, said: “The damages of keeping the economy closed as it is could be worse than losing a few more people.” (Golisano has since said his comments were misrepresented, and has apologised.)Historically, there have always been titans of industry who prized the lifeless thing that is profit over living beings, who paid bribes in order to operate unhindered, worked children to death or put labourers in mortal danger in sweatshops and coal mines. There were also those who pressed on with fossil fuel extraction and burning despite what they knew, or refused to know, about climate change. One of the primary uses of wealth has always been to buy your way out of the common fate, or, at least, it has come with a belief that you can disassociate from society at large. And while the rich are often conservative, conservatives more often align with the rich, whatever their economic status.The idea that everything is connected is an affront to conservatives who cherish a macho every-man-for-himself frontier fantasy. Climate change has been a huge insult to them – this science that says what comes out of our cars and chimneys shapes the fate of the world in the long run and affects crops, sea level, forest fires and so much more. If everything is connected, then the consequences of every choice and act and word have to be examined, which we see as love in action and they see as impingement upon absolute freedom, freedom being another word for absolutely no limits on the pursuit of self-interest. Ultimately, a significant portion of conservatives and corporate leaders regard science as an annoyance that they can refuse to recognise. Some insist they can choose whatever rules and facts they want, as though these too are just free-market commodities to pick and choose from or remake according to one’s whims. “This denial of science and critical thinking among religious ultraconservatives now haunts the American response to the coronavirus crisis,” wrote the journalist Katherine Stewart in the New York Times.Our rulers showed little willingness to recognise the ominous possibilities of the pandemic in the US, the UK, Brazil and many other countries. They failed in their most important job, and denying that failure will be a major focus for them. And while it may be inevitable that the pandemic will result in an economic crash, it is also turning into an opportunity for authoritarian power grabs in the Philippines, Hungary, Israel and the US – a reminder that the largest problems are still political, and so are their solutions.When a storm subsides, the air is washed clean of whatever particulate matter has been obscuring the view, and you can often see farther and more sharply than at any other time. When this storm clears, we may, as do people who have survived a serious illness or accident, see where we were and where we should go in a new light. We may feel free to pursue change in ways that seemed impossible while the ice of the status quo was locked up. We may have a profoundly different sense of ourselves, our communities, our systems of production and our future.For many of us in the developed world, what has changed most immediately is spatial. We have stayed home, those of us who have homes, and away from contact with others. We have withdrawn from schools, workplaces, conferences, vacations, gyms, errands, parties, bars, clubs, churches, mosques, synagogues, from the busyness and bustle of everyday life. The philosopher-mystic Simone Weil once wrote to a faraway friend: “Let us love this distance, which is thoroughly woven with friendship, since those who do not love each other are not separated.” We have withdrawn from each other to protect each other. And people have found ways to help the vulnerable, despite the need to remain physically distant.My friend Renato Redentor Constantino, a climate campaigner, wrote to me from the Philippines, and said: “We are witness today to daily displays of love that remind us of the many reasons why humans have survived this long. We encounter epic acts of courage and citizenship each day in our neighbourhoods and in other cities and countries, instances that whisper to us that the depredations of a few will eventually be overcome by legions of stubborn people who refuse the counsel of despair, violence, indifference and arrogance that so-called leaders appear so eager nowadays to trigger.”When we are no longer trying to unlink ourselves from the chain of a spreading disease, I wonder if we will rethink how we were linked, how we moved about and how the goods we rely on moved about. Perhaps we will appreciate the value of direct face-to-face contact more. Perhaps the Europeans who have sung together from their balconies or applauded together for their medical workers, and the Americans who came out to sing or dance on their suburban blocks, will have a different sense of belonging. Perhaps we will find a new respect for the workers who produce our food and those who bring it to our tables.Although staying put is hard, maybe we will be reluctant to resume our rushing about, and something of the stillness now upon us will stay with us. We may rethink the wisdom of having much of our most vital stuff – medicine, medical equipment – made on other continents. We may also rethink the precarious just-in-time supply chains. I have often thought that the wave of privatisation that has characterised our neoliberal age began with the privatisation of the human heart, the withdrawal from a sense of a shared fate and social bonds. It is to be hoped that this shared experience of catastrophe will reverse the process. A new awareness of how each of us belongs to the whole and depends on it may strengthen the case for meaningful climate action, as we learn that sudden and profound change is possible after all.“Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers,” Wordsworth wrote, a little more than 200 years ago. Perhaps this will be the moment that we recognise that there is enough food, clothing, shelter, healthcare and education for all – and that access to these things should not depend on what job you do and whether you earn enough money. Perhaps the pandemic is also making the case, for those who were not already convinced, for universal healthcare and basic income. In the aftermath of disaster, a change of consciousness and priorities are powerful forces.I have found over and over that the proximity of death in shared calamity makes many people more urgently alive, less attached to the small things in life and more committed to the big ones, often including civil society or the common good.I have mostly written about 20th-century disasters, but one analogy a bit further back comes to mind: the Black Death, which wiped out a third of Europe’s population, and, in England, later led to peasant revolts against war taxes and wage caps that were officially quashed, but nevertheless led to more rights and freedoms for peasants and labourers. In the emergency legislation passed in the US in March, many workers gained new sick-leave rights. Lots of things we were assured were impossible – housing the homeless, for example – have come to pass in some places.But often the most significant consequences of disasters are not immediate or direct. The 2008 financial collapse led to 2011’s Occupy Wall Street uprising, which prompted a new reckoning with economic inequality and a new scrutiny of the human impact of exploitative mortgages, student loans, for profit-colleges, health-insurance systems and more, and that in turn amplified the profiles of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, whose ideas have helped pull the Democratic party to the left, towards policies that will make the US fairer and more equal. The conversations stirred by Occupy and its sister movements across the globe incited more critical scrutiny of ruling powers, and more demands for economic justice. Changes in the public sphere originate within the inidual, but also, changes in the world at large affect our sense of self, our priorities and our sense of the possible.We are only in the early stages of this disaster, and we are also in a strange stillness. It is like the Christmas truce of 1914, when German and English soldiers stopped fighting for a day, the guns fell silent and soldiers mingled freely. War itself paused. There’s a way that our getting and spending has been a kind of war against the Earth. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, carbon emissions have plummeted. Reports say the air above Los Angeles, Beijing and New Delhi is miraculously clean. Parks all over the US are shut to visitors, which may have a beneficial effect on wildlife. In the last government shutdown of 2018-2019, elephant seals at Point Reyes National Seashore just north of San Francisco took over a new beach, and now own it for the duration of their season of mating and birthing on land.There’s another analogy that comes to mind. When a caterpillar enters its chrysalis, it dissolves itself, quite literally, into liquid. In this state, what was a caterpillar and will be a butterfly is neither one nor the other, it’s a sort of living soup. Within this living soup are the imaginal cells that will catalyse its transformation into winged maturity. May the best among us, the most visionary, the most inclusive, be the imaginal cells – for now we are in the soup. The outcome of disasters is not foreordained. It’s a conflict, one that takes place while things that were frozen, solid and locked up have become open and fluid – full of both the best and worst possibilities. We are both becalmed and in a state of profound change.But this is also a time of depth for those spending more time at home and more time alone, looking outward at this unanticipated world. We often ide emotions into good and bad, happy and sad, but I think they can equally be ided into shallow and deep, and the pursuit of what is supposed to be happiness is often a flight from depth, from one’s own interior life and the suffering around us – and not being happy is often framed as a failure. But there is meaning as well as pain in sadness, mourning and grief, the emotions born of empathy and solidarity. If you are sad and frightened, it is a sign that you care, that you are connected in spirit. If you are overwhelmed – well, it is overwhelming, and it will take decades of study, analysis, discussion and contemplation to understand how and why 2020 suddenly took us all into marshy new territory.Seven years ago, Patrisse Cullors wrote a sort of mission statement for Black Lives Matter: “Provide hope and inspiration for collective action to build collective power to achieve collective transformation. Rooted in grief and rage but pointed towards vision and dreams.” It is beautiful not only because it is hopeful, not only because then Black Lives Matter set out and did transformative work, but because it acknowledges that hope can coexist with difficulty and suffering. The sadness in the depths and the fury that burns above are not incompatible with hope, because we are complex creatures, because hope is not optimism that everything will be fine regardless.Hope offers us clarity that, amid the uncertainty ahead, there will be conflicts worth joining and the possibility of winning some of them. And one of the things most dangerous to this hope is the lapse into believing that everything was fine before disaster struck, and that all we need to do is return to things as they were. Ordinary life before the pandemic was already a catastrophe of desperation and exclusion for too many human beings, an environmental and climate catastrophe, an obscenity of inequality. It is too soon to know what will emerge from this emergency, but not too soon to start looking for chances to help decide it. It is, I believe, what many of us are preparing to do.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dcac2a6f8a716a0e4c7e2ae689aed23c2288b30/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf598c537a604f6bd21057f62f33c75a","title":"covid 19 what if im immunocompromised","story":"Hannah Devlin speaks to Dr Jenna Macciochi about how our immune systems fight off infections such as coronavirus, and – as per lots of your questions – what happens if we’re immunocompromised"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/822473efc6d62333b2869a5e5498c36c9e8307b4/0_511_5005_3003/master/5005..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dcf18be0274dd8b3ab472dff7055b29","title":"sunshine exercise social distancing uk in pictures","story":"As warm weekend weather arrived in the UK, Matt Hancock said people needed to follow the rules on coronavirus or the government would be forced to ban all exercise outside "},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Getty ImagesTeaching children has emerged as the main source of stress for families adapting to Government-introduced restrictions designed to curb Covid-19.Overall the population has suffered a significant decline in wellbeing, with high levels of stress and anxiety, according to draft research findings into the psychological impact of the measures.Being outdoors, whether walking or gardening, had the most calming effect for people, the research conducted by a sub-group of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) indicated.In contrast, home-schooling of children was the highest reported stressor for parents who responded to a survey of more than 600 people.“While not completely surprising, the frequency with which home-schooling of children popped up as a source of stress points to the need for more support for parents in this endeavour,” said Liam Delaney, professor of economics at UCD, one of the members of the sub-group.He said the consumption of social media regarding the epidemic was also a major source of anxiety among people.The day reconstruction study was conducted on March 23rd and March 24th, after schools and colleges were closed but before the 2km limit of outside movement and cocooning of over-70s was introduced. Key messagesSeparate research commissioned by the behavioural change sub-group of NPHET found a high awareness of the key messages around hand-washing and social distances, but lower awareness of cough and sneeze etiquette rules.One-quarter of people struggled to recall what they needed to do if they had coronavirus symptoms, and what to do if they came into contact with someone with symptoms.The research suggested emotional and efficacy messages have a greater impact on behaviour than material stressing awareness of the rules. People under 40, and men, seemed to be slightly less aware despite feeling they are more likely to contract the virus.Prof Delaney said the high level of adherence to the restrictions showed no sign of dropping at the time the research was carried out.The full study is due to be published shortly.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"New leader says the four largest parties should form strong governmentWednesday forecast to be mild, bright and dry over most of IrelandResearch finds the population has suffered a significant decline in wellbeing, with high levels of stress and anxietySouth Dublin home has seven infected residents and 20-plus staff sick or in self-isolationCovid-19 fatalities in Ireland are replicating gender patterns across the worldFamily of coronavirus victim says pandemic\u0027s impact on grief is often overlookedStaying in pandemic mode for three months means each GP will not see one person with a life-altering condition\u0026lsquoFour legs\u0026rsquo and stable majority needed, says Regional Independent group Denis NaughtenTalks under way to break impasse over moving 600 consultants to public system\u0026lsquoThe people on the front line need them more than I do\u0026rsquoChildcare scheme for health workers being discussed as 16 more patients dieCoronavirus pandemic brings Redemptoristine Sisters closer to the publicIntensive care unit admissions not as steep as health service feared a couple of weeks ago, Colm Henry saysGarda\u0026iacute notify National Museum of Ireland after being alerted by local peopleGarda\u0026iacute tell motorists not to leave cars unlocked while parked up during coronavirus pandemicCourses in crime writing, narrative fiction and poetry will be offered free, mayor saysSupply of protective equipment \u0026lsquocritical\u0026rsquo for the functioning of new community hubsIrish Dental Association says that facilities should be open to all patientsStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4222995.1586247631!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"alan kelly labour party unlikely to enter coalition government","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour Party leader Alan Kelly said he was disappointed the Green Party was not more willing to enter government.

Photograph: Nick BradshawAs the scale of the Covid-19 pandemic became all too apparent last month, Esther Waters knew she would have an enormous challenge on her hands to keep her 82-year-old mother safe.Esther’s mother, Esther Duggan, has dementia and until recent days was living alone in Dundrum, south Dublin.Her daughter had been visiting her for a couple of hours a day each day throughout March, making sure she had company and everything she needed, but then the crisis deepened and older people were told to cocoon while everyone else was asked to keep their distance.Understandably, Esther senior struggled to comprehend the new rules and “still went out for her walks to the shops and even gate-crashed Mass. I saw her in the empty church on the live feed,” her daughter told The .Despite trying over many days, Ms Waters said she “couldn’t break through to her about isolation and protecting others. She was adamant that, despite all attempts from friends and family, she wouldn’t come to my house only 4km away in Blackrock. ”After multiple attempts “to relocate my lovely mother, I turned to the Garda in Dundrum and told them I was going to shoot her – joking of course,” Ms Waters continued.Immediately gardaí took control of the situation and not because of the firearm threat.“I didn’t even have to ask: Sgt Ivan and community garda Linda were familiar with the situation and jumped into action,” she said. “They had a quick chat with me in the station car park, assured me that they’d get her to move and asked me to lead the way to her house immediately.”The two gardaí spent over an hour and a half “gently coaxing her out into my car”.While they were doing that, Ms Waters packed an overnight bag for her mother and included familiar bits and pieces from her bedroom.“At my house Garda Linda took Mum into the self-contained room and unpacked the bag with Mum, arranging her radio, photographs, toiletries etc. Gda Ivan spent his time reassuring my children and, I suspect, checking out that he was actually delivering Mum into a safe environment. He showed them videos on his phone and instructed them on handwashing techniques.”PhotographsMs Waters estimated that the gardaí spent at least another 90 minutes settling her mother in.“You would think that they had already gone beyond the call of duty: but no, they followed up with calls the next morning asking for photographs of Mum and personal details. They are putting her image out to gardaí in case she wanders from her unfamiliar surroundings,” Ms Waters continued.“Again, you’d think they’d gone beyond the call of duty: but no, they both arrived with a bouquet of flowers for Mum and cookies for the kids at around 8pm on night two of Mum’s relocation.”She said she could not praise the two gardaí highly enough for their “compassion, consideration, patience, tenderness and, as if they had nothing else to do, they took their time”.“There was no sense of rushing – or of Mum being an inconvenience to them. They acted as if it was their own mum. I am completely in awe and forever grateful.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4222304.1586192529!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it is a scary time the nursing homes battling coronavirus clusters","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe sharp rise in cluster outbreaks has caused alarm in nursing homes which have managed to avoid any coronavirus infections. Photograph: John StillwellPATwo Dublin nursing homes battling clusters of coronavirus infections have called for the additional staff, protective equipment and resources promised to the sector to stem the outbreaks.The nursing homes, which have asked not to be identified in order to protect residents and staff, are among the 57 residential-care homes with outbreaks, a sixfold increase in just over a week.One of the homes, on the south side of Dublin, has seven residents and a number of staff who have tested positive for Covid-19. The facility is down more than 20 staff who are on sick leave or self-isolating because of their exposure to the virus and is struggling to find replacement staff.The outbreak has resulted in senior managers who would not typically be working on the floor of the nursing home now doing so to fill the gaps left in staffing.A senior manager at the nursing home said that while the Health Service Executive had provided additional personal protective equipment (PPE), the real requirement was for additional staff.All staff currently in self-isolation and on sick leave were being checked on every day and the nursing home was “charting for their planned return to work”, a spokesman said.Healthcare demands“There is a relatively small pool of suitable people available considering the demand being imposed nationally by the acute system, public and community nursing facilities and finally the private nursing homes, so we are being realistic in our expectations as to what the system will be able to provide in real terms,” the manager said in a statement released to The .The other nursing home, in north Dublin, has been “battling” to contain the spread of the virus since last month, a spokesman for the facility said. He declined to disclose the number of Covid-19-infected residents or staff at the facility or the number who are self-isolating because of exposure. He said the HSE had instructed the home that only State health officials were allowed to release details of case numbers publicly.“What would greatly help is the immediate supply of PPE and extra resources which the Government spoke about,” said the spokesman.The outbreak in nursing homes is concentrated in the east of the country which has 41 of the 57 Covid-19 clusters, followed by seven in the west and three in the midwest.Infection fearsThe sharp increase in the number of outbreaks has caused alarm in nursing homes which have managed to avoid any coronavirus infections. “I am terrified because every day you get up, the number of clusters is increasing,” said Lorraine (not real name) who manages a nursing home in the midlands with up to 50 residents and 40 staff.The manager, who did not want her nursing home identified out of concern for her residents and staff, said they received just four items of PPE in one delivery from the HSE last week, though they have received sufficient equipment since then to cope with an outbreak.“It is a massive, massive worry. On the outside you are portraying it like everything is okay and trying to put a brave face on it, but underneath you are stressed out. You are like the swan – you are graceful on top and underneath you are going mental,” she said.“It is just the unknown. We don’t know what is going to happen. Will we be able to open the doors before December? It is a scary time.”Lorraine said that the home has had to switch off RTÉ’s Six One News in the home’s day room – a daily watching ritual for many of her residents – and removed copies of a daily newspaper one day because they had news stories about the coronavirus pandemic affecting nursing homes and older people.“They love the six o’clock news – that is their thing and we have it on – but it is obviously doom and gloom and if we feel it is getting a bit dramatic, we do turn it off.” Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4221960.1586170700!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it s just stuff doctor leaves all possessions behind in australia to return to work in ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Marianne Hennigan at Dublin Airport on Saturday. Photograph: Ireland’s CallThe world has changed completely since Dr Marianne Hennigan started a four-week holiday in New Zealand in mid-March. Then, governments were waking up to the reality of Covid-19, but it was still a disease mostly confined to China and Europe and not to Australia and New Zealand.Nobody expected the raft of restrictions which would shut down the world in the space of a few weeks. Within a week of her arrival in New Zealand, the bus tour was cancelled and she, along with others on the tour, was forced to self-isolate in Auckland. Dr Hennigan (31), originally from Deansgrange, Co Dublin, was working in Perth at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital as a locum doctor in emergency medicine. Like hundreds of other Irish newly-qualified doctors she found the opportunities and the climate in Perth agreeable and had spent three years there. Her flight back to Perth from Auckland was abruptly cancelled with no replacement available. In this hiatus, she made up her mind not to go back to Perth at all, but leave her car and her possessions there and return to Ireland to work. “In the end of the day it’s just stuff. I really enjoyed working in Perth,” she said. “It was lovely, the biggest thing that I regret is that I didn’t get to say goodbye to any of my friends when I left. I’m sure I will at some point. Unfortunately, none of us really expected what was going to happen.” Her marathon flight home, first to Doha in Qatar, and then to Ireland was facilitated by the Ireland’s Call Initiative which is not to be confused with On Call for Ireland, the HSE call for healthcare professionals, students and volunteers to help tackle coronavirus in Ireland. The Ireland’s Call Initiative was set up by businessman Neil Sands as a philanthropic enterprise to bring doctors and nurses home from abroad and to pay for their flights and accommodation in self-isolation for a fortnight. Ireland’s Call hopes to bring home 100 Irish medics from abroad in the coming months. She is the first to be repatriated under the initiative and one of more than 50,000 people who have offered their services to the HSE since last month. “We are not the real heroes,” she stressed. “The real heroes are the people who have been there from day one. We are the reinforcements. “I am delighted to be home. I was particularly happy to see my mum at the airport. It is just a relief to be coming home for the foreseeable future and that I won’t be stuck. “The main fear is that working in ICU, where it is high-risk, if I were to get sick, my family wouldn’t be able to come out to see me in Perth. At this time you want to be in proximity with your family and around Irish people.” She will need the next fortnight to register for and find work. Her experience in emergency respiratory medicine in Perth will be invaluable for her and for the HSE as it seeks to cope with the pandemic. There will be other business to attend to and making a will is something she feels is necessary given the risks involved. “I think everybody is fearful at this point in time when you see young healthcare workers getting sick and dying,” she said. “It is obvious that I didn’t intend to do it at this stage of my life. It is our profession and it is something that I want to help out. I would much rather be in the front line helping out than being stuck in another country in an Airbnb.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4222505.1586203564!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no point in coalition with fg ff without two smaller groupings","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDenis Naughten: the Regional Independent group is only interested in “forming a government that can last five years”. Photograph: Joe O’ShaughnessyRoscommon TD Denis Naughten is a member of the nine-strong Regional Independent group of TDs which is seen as the most likely grouping to join a coalition involving the two Civil War parties.Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael met again on Monday as they work towards publishing a framework document that will outline how a coalition between the two will operate. They will meet again this week to finalise the document, which is understood to raise the prospect of much stronger State intervention in the health, housing and childcare sectors.The Covid-19 crisis has seen the State temporarily take over large aspects of the private health system and pay the wages of childcare workers. One source said that, on childcare, it would be hard for a Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael government to undo what has been done in recent weeks, but added that such details have not yet been discussed between the parties.Both Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar hope to approach smaller parties and groupings when the framework document is finished in an attempt to build a broader coalition.Covid-19 crisisBetween them, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have 72 seats, which is eight short of a Dáil majority. Mr Varadkar has said a third party is needed and Mr Martin has spoken of such a government needing a strong majority to deal with the fallout from the Covid-19 crisis. However, the Green Party is continuing to advocate for a national unity government and Labour has thus far stuck to its position that it wants to go into opposition. The Social Democrats have said their policies would be incompatible with a Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael combination. It has led some in the Civil War parties to suggest that a government may need to be formed with the support of Independents alone, but Mr Naughten said “There is no point in participating in that type of government.”The former minister for communications has said the regional group has been clear it is only interested in “forming a government that can last five years”.“Our view from day one has always been that there needs to be four legs to this stool – two big parties and two small parties or groups.” ‘Bully any party’He said a new government “not only has to have a majority, it has to have a stable one”. “We don’t believe that is possible having a bare majority of 80 or 81,” he said. “We believe there is a need for another party to be involved.”Mr Varadkar on Monday said “we need a third party, a third pillar as part of that government”, adding: “It’s not our view that we should try to bully any party into government.”Meanwhile, the Dáil will sit in the Convention Centre in Dublin if a vote needs to be taken to elect a new taoiseach.The business committee of the Dáil made the decision at a meeting on Monday where it was also decided that another restricted sitting would take place on April 16th. The restricted Leister House sitting – with a set number of TDs from various parties and groupings only allowed attend – will see the Taoiseach, Minister for Health and Minister for Finance take questions.The move to the Convention Centre would allow all 160 TDs attend the Dáil sitting and vote for taoiseach while respecting rules on social distancing.The best news and analysis from the campaign trailStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4222993.1586247179!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sunny weather expected with temperatures to reach 18 degrees","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tClarinbridge, Co Galway, on Tuesday morning.

Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Boris Johnson in intensive care with coronavirus amid outpouring of support - latest newsVicars told they can ignore guidelines banning them from their own churches ahead of Easter servicePolitics latest news: Boris Johnson was working to a \u0026#39stripped back diary\u0026#39 on doctor\u0026#39s orders before his ICU admissionSurgeon is latest NHS victim to die of coronavirus Coronavirus cases in Birmingham and the Midlands, mappedCoronavirus cases in Scotland, mappedCan I go to work?

Iceland is doing both.Mr Gudnason\u0027s team of 60 police investigators and healthcare workers act as detectives on each confirmed case, tracking down those they have come in contact with.  Testing is carried out by The National Health Service on those showing symptoms. But on top of this, a biopharma company, deCODE Genetics, has been screening random samples of the population to build the world\u0027s most extensive study yet of how the virus behaves in a population.Early results show 50 per cent of carriers of the virus are asymptomatic. It has also revealed up to 40 \u0027mutations\u0027, or strains, of the disease. They claim to have traced strains back to Italy, Austria, the US, and seven cases in particular to one undisclosed football match in the UK.Crucially, all the testing has meant Iceland has been able to avoid a lockdown or quarantine as cases are tracked, traced and isolated before spreading rapidly - thus alleviating pressure on the hospitals.The data rolling in has meant authorities can more accurately design methods of controlling the virus, Mr Stefánsson says.So far there is a government ban on gatherings of more than 20 people and light guidelines on social distancing.The guidance is imposed not by force but by trust, Katrín Jakobsdottir, Iceland\u0027s prime minister, tells The  .Iceland has a history of socially liberal culture, she says. That means acceptance of differences and minorities, but in this case, it means to trust, not to force. We have no tradition of militarism or an army. We ask for cooperation, rather than force it.  She adds that the science approach allows her to leave the virus policy out of the battlefield of politics.The limited guidelines means business is slow for most shops, but with few exceptions the country is open for business.Icelanders can still get their morning coffee, sit down at local bookshops. Even stop at a local ice-cream parlour.At Reykjavík Roasters, a small but popular independent cafe in Reykjavík\u0027s centre, customers trickle in despite the pandemic. The city\u0027s centre is unusually calm.“Honestly, what I miss more than anything are the public pools” pensioner Auður Styrkásdóttir says apologetically, adding “this is a luxury.”One of the main benefits of Iceland\u0027s system is the school programme has been largely unaffected.Pre-schools, primary, and secondary schools have stayed open while higher education has moved online.Some people have taken to social media asking why children\u0027s safety is perhaps taken less seriously than those of adult students.Mr Gudnason points out that closing down institutions that serve children has a more significant social impact Our study suggests that children are less effective in spreading this virus than adults. We measure every decision with it\u0027s effectiveness and closing these institutions is unlikely to produce meaningful results at this time.Part of Iceland\u0027s success story is it\u0027s readiness.We realised at the end of 2019 that we should prepare for a pandemic, Mr Gudnason says.Our emergency system is clear, it is efficient and importantly frequently in use. Be it storms, avalanches, volcanic eruptions or a pandemic the system is the same. Health authorities step into a well-oiled machine, highly trained infrastructure and years of experience in building communication channels and trust.On Friday the head of Iceland\u0027s response, Víðir Reynisson, warned against drawing too much from the Iceland model, pointing out that the country\u0027s size, strong channels of communication and social cohesion helped.There are many factors that make things easier on us, he said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus vaccine could ready autumn scientists suggest","story":"A coronavirus vaccine could be ready as early as the autumn,  an Oxford University research team has said.The “best case scenario” suggests scientists are aiming for a much more ambitious rollout than previously thought.However, the Oxford team, one of many working around the clock to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, warned that it was still trying to source funding for manufacturing the potential drug.The Oxford trial, a collaboration between the University’s Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group clinical teams, has recruited more than 500 volunteers aged between 18 and 55 who will begin the tests this month following an “overwhelming” response.Asked about the timescale for a potential roll-out, if successful, the researchers said: “The best-case scenario is that by the autumn of 2020 we have the results about the effectiveness of the vaccine from a phase III trial and the ability to manufacture large amounts of the vaccine.”They acknowledged, however, that such “best-case timeframes” were “highly ambitious” and subject to change. They added: “We are currently trying to source additional funding for the scale-up of vaccine manufacturing to produce enough doses for deployment.”Participants will remain in the trial for six months, attending appointments at the Oxford Vaccine Centre for screening, vaccination with either the new COVID-19 vaccine or a control injection, and blood tests. The team warned that if the peak of disease transmission arrives before the vaccine is ready for trials, the studies will be “challenging”. “If virus transmission has stopped, then it is impossible to assess whether the vaccine can prevent disease,” they said.“At the moment it is not possible to identify who has already been infected, and if the virus is spreading quickly throughout the population it might be difficult to find unexposed people to take part in the trial. Conducting trials after the peak subsides presents another problem, because so many people will have developed a natural immunity by then, and the amount of transmission will have dropped so that those who are still not immune will take longer to be exposed to the virus.”Conducting trials after the peak subsides presents another problem, because so many people will have developed a natural immunity by then, and the amount of transmission will have dropped so that those who are still not immune will take longer to be exposed to the virus. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government formulate new lockdown exit strategy scientific adviser","story":"Ministers are scrambling to formulate a new lockdown exit strategy following warnings from their scientific advisor that mass testing cannot be introduced for at least a month. Two weeks ago, health officials said more than 3.5 million antibody tests had been purchased, and would be available within days, allowing key workers to return to employment.The tests, hailed as “gamechanging” by the Prime Minister, were seen as key to the lifting of dramatic restrictions on movement, now in place for more than a fortnight.But yesterday Prof John Bell, from Oxford University, who is advising the Government on such tests said they had so far failed - and warned it would be at least a month before large scale testing could be offered. Health officials have said the social distancing measures will be reviewed after Easter, which is forecast to see a peak in cases. Government sources said the review will use surveillance data - which measures prevalence of the virus in a sample of the population - and latest statistics on hospital cases and deaths, to assess whether any interventions should be relaxed, or further tightened.But scientists suggested that it is unlikely restrictions could soon be removed en masse, as tests show who has developed immunity remain months off. Next week the Government and its advisors will consider whether the patterns of virus transmission would allow them to make changes to the restrictions, in coming weeks and months. Options include regional variations to the rules, so that areas thought to have been through the worst of the crisis might see an easing of restrictions first. Alternatives under discussion could see full lockdown measures alternated with less stringent restrictions in waves, in a bid to manage pressures on the NHS, while preventing some of the worst economic fallout. Ministers in Scotland have suggested that while full restrictions could stay in place for three months, relaxations in the rules could see a “phased” approach, with advice to see loved ones, but recommendations against wider socialising. But yesterday England’s chief medical officer - returning to work after more than a week in self-isolation, with symptoms of coronavirus - said it would be a “mistake” to even discuss such options yet. Professor Chris Whitty, speaking at the daily Downing Street press briefing, said that despite forecasts the peak may hit at Easter, this was not necessarily the case. And he said: The key thing is to get to the point where we are confident we have reached the peak and this is now beyond the peak, and at that point I think it is possible to have a serious discussion about all the things we need to do step-by-step to move to the next phase of managing this. “But I think to start having that discussion until we\u0027re confident that that\u0027s where we\u0027ve got to, would I think be a mistake.”Prof Whitty suggested that an effective antibody test would be most effective between 21 and 28 days after those given it had been exposed to the virus - meaning they were needed “later” in the epidemic, when the virus had spread more widely. The chief medical officer said that it was still too early to “start calling the point where we can move to the next phase of this epidemic” - suggesting stringent measures may stay in place for some time yet. He said planning for the next phase involved “a very large number of technical elements” including the development of vaccines and drugs. Scientists have repeatedly said it is unlikely that a vaccine could be ready in much less than a year. Professor Dame Angela McLean, the Ministry of Defence\u0027s chief scientific adviser, said decisions could only be made once data had been collected.She said: We need a good, long time series of data on all of these stages of infection in order to be able to tell what the impact of the measures that came on March 23 are going to be.It\u0027s too early to tell yet, we need people to carry on following those instructions so that we can work out three weeks later what actually happens in hospitals.We need to know how well the current restrictions are working before we can say anything sensible about what the next stage might be.Responding to a question about whether Government measures could be eased in a staggered way, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: Obviously we\u0027re very mindful of the challenges businesses are facing, small businesses, all employers and of course the workforce as well.But the risk is if we start taking our eye off the ball, of tackling the coronavirus, stopping the spread and getting through the peak, we risk delaying the point at which we could in the future take those decisions on easing restrictions.So it is really important right now to keep the over-riding focus on maintaining the discipline that we\u0027ve had, keeping adherence to the guidelines that the Government has set out and making sure that we stop the spread of coronavirus.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government urged consider regional approach ending uk coronavirus","story":"The UK\u0027s coronavirus lockdown measures should be eased on a regional basis once areas pass their virus peak, a senior local government figure has suggested.David Stewart, the leader of Isle of Wight Council, on Monday night called on ministers to consider lifting restrictions within a fortnight, arguing that there has to be a balance between how long you can lock people in and letting them live their lives.Mr Stewart, a former senior police officer, said cases of Covid-19 on the island – officially just 32 – are expected to peak within a fortnight, after which the lockdown could be eased ahead of other parts of the UK and even while curtailments remain on travel to and from the mainland.The intervention will heap further pressure on the Government to outline a potential exit strategy as the promised three-week review date looms next Monday.The principle of lifting restrictions regionally formed part of the package of scientific evidence upon which Boris Johnson ordered the lockdown in the first place, and was acknowledged as a possible way out by the deputy chief medical officer on Sunday.It is arguably the most prominent of a number of emerging potential strategies to get society moving again. Others include allowing more freedom for those less vulnerable to Covid-19 or lifting restrictions in areas that demonstrate the right blend of disease control and economic need.Professor Neil Ferguson, the leader of the Imperial College London team whose advice prompted the lockdown, said on Sunday a precise strategy would be formulated in the next week or two.However, on Monday night, Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, said that to endorse any potential exit at this stage risked undermining efforts to enforce social distancing in the immediate term.The developments came as ministers in Denmark – one of the first countries to impose a lockdown – were expected to announce an easing of measures, starting as early as next week. Meanwhile, Angelo Borrelli, the head of Italy\u0027s Civil Protection Agency, suggested a phase two of his country\u0027s lockdown could begin next month.Mr Stewart told The  that businesses on the Isle of Wight were suffering dramatically and added: There\u0027s a worry some will never come out of hibernation if this goes on.We think we\u0027re a bit behind the curve here and we\u0027ll hit our peak numbers within the next two weeks. It\u0027s very important we don\u0027t jump the gun but, when we get through the peak, people are going to need to get out and spread their wings, as long as they are sensible.You have got to give people something to look forward to.All the principal scenarios for lifting the lockdown involve waiting until the virus has peaked and the number of deaths has started to fall dramatically.If the UK timeline mirrors that of China, the Government could be in a position to consider lifting the restrictions by early summer.One potential strategy could involve intermittent social distancing, whereby lockdown measures are lifted on an alternating basis by region. A second could be to allow the healthy and immune out while shielding the vulnerable.A third seek and destroy scenario involves waiting until the virus is at a very low level before lifting restrictions and then combating the remaining cases through aggressive tracing, testing, isolation and precision quarantine zones. This method has been adopted successfully in Singapore and South Korea.All but the fourth strategy – waiting or a vaccine – rely heavily on the widespread availability of testing, which officials are currently struggling to ramp up.Robert Halfon, the chairman of the Education Select Committee and a former minister, said on Monday: I suspect that, when things get better, we will be allowed out in stages.Vulnerable citizens will probably be told to stay at home and there will be staged openings of schools and restaurants and businesses... but the only thing we can do is follow the advice of the chief medical officer and chief science officer.Christiane Woopen, a professor at the University of Cologne, co-authored a study published last week which suggested the easing of restrictions based on a combination of locality, vulnerability, age and economic conditions.The public deserve it – they are taking a lot of hardship, she said. They have to trust what political leaders are doing in the next months.Speaking on Sunday, Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England, appeared to endorse the principle of regional lifting of restrictions.London has lot of cases here – if it was found that a large number of people were immune then it may be that different interventions could come off sooner or later, she added.Equally, if we find there are areas where there have been less cases then we need to be very mindful what would happen if the social interaction levels increased in those particular areas and what the impact may be.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/03/TELEMMGLPICT000229001046_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqDQVK81QMLSkr-IuGRMUJHCVB-e_nxfetMVMJL5pqsDA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"has coronavirus taught remainers value older generation","story":"Ours is a very self-obsessed, abrasive cultureWhy are we putting the economy on hold, suspending liberty, destroying hundreds of businesses, ripping up plans and trashing the futures of so many young people, for the sake of prolonging the lives of a few thousand people who, if the statistics are to be believed, would probably have died at some point over the next 12 months to five years, even without contracting the coronavirus?It’s not a nice way of phrasing it, but if you take a step back, that is what this amounts to. Now clearly, not all those at risk of Covid-19 fall into the category of old or infirm — there are examples of young and apparently fit people succumbing to its horror — but the overwhelming majority, whether dying of or with it, are. Since when did we start caring so much?The arrival of the pandemic has unleashed some nasty things beyond the disease itself on these shores. The UK, despite Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s assertions, has been slowly drifting away from being the home of liberty for some time — the Brexit debate, which split the public worryingly close to evenly down the middle, suggested far more people here are on board with unaccountable big state power than we would have ever thought possible.Since the lockdown began, that curtain-twitching streak has been given a new vehicle through which to express itself, with a vociferous cohort, driven, shamefully, by swathes of the media, actively encouraging the suspension of liberty at every turn in order to ‘save lives’. Indeed, no encroachment by the authorities is too great for some, with people praising the harassment of law-abiding citizens, those who had previously labeled their government ‘fascist’ slamming it for not imposing a police state fast enough, and one particularly bombastic public figure calling those with the gall to venture outside on a summer’s day ‘traitors.’ And all this in the pursuit of ‘saving lives.’It’s odd that we now seem so desperate to protect these lives at all cost. But a matter of months ago, this same country openly entertained voices (many of whom now chatter about ‘protecting the NHS’) who opined that the 2016 EU referendum should be rerun, because the elderly folk who had voted for Brexit were either dead or dying — so their wishes, having been frustrated and delayed, could now be conveniently ignored. For years now, we have heard about how the majority of the elderly of this nation, for the sin of not voting the right way, are racists and bigots. Not only that, but they are also drains on the system — representing the ‘ticking time bomb’ of social care, sitting atop gold plated pensions, and clogging up the housing supply for the restless young by refusing to stop breathing. Deaths in countries under lockdownOf the unholy trinity of sins you can commit today, being old sits alongside being white and male as one of the traits you cannot help having, but for which you are fair game to go after. It can be a lonely, isolating experience, being on the receiving end of a cultural upheaval such as the one we have been undergoing. And, indeed, loneliness is one of the key issues affecting the elderly today.According to Age UK, over 2 million elderly people live alone in the UK, with hundreds of thousands saying they can go months without seeing or speaking to a friend or relative. Many experience feelings of loneliness or depression, and frankly, who can blame them? Add to that the sense that other segments of society blames you for its ills, and you realise that, at times, the physical aging part of being old might not even be the worst thing.Ours is a very self-obsessed, abrasive culture. And in so many ways, the response to the coronavirus — the angry demands, the blaming, the fear — is a continuation of it. But the fact that we are prepared to go to such lengths to protect lives we have so roundly treated with contempt for the past few years is a positive sign. People, faced with the mortality not just of themselves, but of elderly friends, relatives and neighbours, and unable to spend any time with them face to face, are volunteering in their thousands, making phone calls, helping with deliveries, and doing what they can to end the social isolation of the elderly, at the very moment their physical isolation has been enforced.One can only hope that this newfound appreciation for them lasts beyond the lockdown. To get the measure of a nation, we must look to how it treats its elders and its most vulnerable. For too long, we have treated ours poorly. It should not have taken a pandemic that relentlessly targeted them for us to realise this — but now we have, it would be wickedness to forget it again.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The woman, who has several long-term health problems but still enjoys life, felt mortified and was extremely upset when she received a letter with a form in a few days later, Age UK said. Another GP surgery in Maesteg, a town in Bridgend County Borough, Wales, asked patients with significant life-limiting illnesses to sign the form in the case they contract coronavirus.Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board has since apologised for any distress caused.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister, has also said that nobody should be forced into making decisions on signing the forms. Her calls came after a family criticised at NHS Tayside when they learned their 86-year-old grandmother agreed to a DNACPR (Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) request from her GP surgery.The open letter from the elderly care charities added: “It would be completely unacceptable to abandon these rights in favour of taking blanket, discriminatory decisions.“It is also crucial that governments and health services across our four nations carefully consider the ways they can provide stronger leadership and guidance – to ensure that people’s rights are upheld and communication with vulnerable people is handled in a far more sensitive way to avoid further worry and upset as we navigate the difficult path ahead of us.Its signatories include: Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director Age UK, Deborah Alsina, Chief Executive Independent Age, Jane Ashcroft, Chief Executive Anchor Hanover, Helena Herklots, Older People’s Commissioner  in Wales, Victoria Lloyd, Chief Executive Age Cymru, Eddie Lynch, Commissioner for Older People in Northern Ireland, Donald Macaskill, Chief Executive, Scottish Care, Linda Robinson, Chief Executive Age Northern Ireland and Brian Sloan, Chief Executive Age Scotland. An NHS spokesperson said: “Do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation’ (DNACPR) orders, should only ever be made on an inidual basis and in consultation with the inidual or their family or carers, as is always the case.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sweden drafts new legislation allow extraordinary steps combat","story":"Sweden\u0027s government is rushing through a new emergency coronavirus law after a rise in deaths over the weekend raised further questions over its less restrictive strategy.Lena Hallengren, the country\u0027s health minister, said that government\u0027s limited existing powers would not allow it to take the tough actions necessary should infection numbers start to spiral upwards.We believe that the provisions currently available under the infectious diseases law are not sufficiently powerful, she told the country\u0027s TT newswire. The new law, she said, would give the authorities possibilities which are at least close to those available to other countries.The announcement came after Stefan Löfven, Sweden\u0027s prime minister, on Friday warned that the coming weeks would see a steady increase in the number of people dying as a result of the virus.We are going to count the dead in their thousands, he told newspaper Dagens Nyheter. We may as well prepare ourselves for that.Sweden\u0027s public health agency on Monday announced 22 new people died on Sunday from the virus, taking the total to 499.  At 49 per million people, this is significantly above the 33 deaths per million and 11 deaths per million seen in neighbouring Denmark and Norway, where unlike in Sweden, schools, kindergartens, bars and restaurants have been closed.However, on Monday the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare said that as many as a fifth of the country\u0027s intensive care places currently remained unfilled.Even in Stockholm, the centre of the epidemic, the regional health chief Björn Eriksson on Monday said there were plenty of spaces both for intensive care and outpatient care.The Swedish army has also erected field hospitals in outside major cities, with the biggest at the Stockholmsmassan conference centre, opening on Monday.The new proposal, which the government gave Sweden\u0027s agencies just 24 hours to respond to during a sped-up consultation phase, will, among other measures, give government authorities special powers to shut down events, institutions, or places where they believe there is a risk of infection, without requiring them to consult parliament.It will also allow the government and its agencies to overrule the regional health authorities to that medicine and medical equipment can be moved to wherever it is most needed.The law, like similar legislation in neighbouring Denmark and Norway, comes with a sunset clause, with the new powers expiring automatically on June 30.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vicars told ignore guidelines banning churches ahead easter","story":"Vicars have been told they can ignore guidelines urging them to not to carry out live streaming of Easter services from their own churches, the  has learned.The Rt Rev Dame Sarah Mullally, Bishop of London and a former chief nurse, has written to all the clergy in her Diocese telling them they can conduct services in their own church because the building matters as a sacred space to people.Her advice is in direct contradiction with Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who told clergy they must film services from our own homes when the Prime Minister announced a nationwide lockdown on March 23.The Archbishop\u0027s instruction also applied to services where clergy are alone in churches, and broadcasting a live feed on the internet.But many priests are beginning to defy the Archbishop\u0027s order by secretly streaming services from their churches via digital platforms this week.In a letter sent to all her clergy in the Diocese of London, Bishop Mullally has said that in certain circumstances a priest can enter his own church and lead worship alone.“Although we can worship God anywhere” she wrote, “many will find comfort, especially in uncertain times, in being part virtually of worship which is taking place in a church building. “Bishop Mullally, who was UK\u0027s chief nursing officer from 1999-2004, said priests could livestream services from within a church building if they could access it via an internal door from their home, or without leaving the curtilage of the church.The Archbishop\u0027s wholesale ban upset priests who felt he does not have the right to order clergy who are answerable to their own bishops.One said: “He’s panicked and shut everything down,” while another vicar who used Zoom to conduct a Palm Sunday for a 90-strong congregation and will do so again on Easter Sunday, said: “The whole situation is ridiculous”.The vicar, who did not want to be named for fear of being forced to stop by his own bishop, said: “I am flying under the radar by using Zoom each Sunday.This is how crazy things are. I am having to be covert when there is no way that I could contaminate anyone nor they me if I were in the church alone. And it really matters to my congregation that I am in my church and in my vestments.”Another vicar, The Rev David Ackerman, of St John The Evangelist, in London’s Kensal Green, expressed anger at the Archbishop of Canterbury’s ban and vowed to stay open. “The police can come and arrest me if they like,” he said.Archbishop Welby’s ban also surprised the Roman Catholic Church which had been liaising with the Church of England to come up with a joint policy. A source close to the Catholic bishops said: “We were working together, then Welby did his own thing. It’s a mess”. A Church of England spokesperson said that the Government was clear that everyone should stay at home and that “it is important that our churches and church leaders follow this advice and lead by example.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 7th april 2020","story":"Alpacas Zebedee and Zucchini are walked by Francesca Bird, an Animal Keeper at Harewood House in Yorkshire, UK.Boris Johnson in intensive care with coronavirus amid outpouring of support - latest newsHow coronavirus could affect the US election: Mail or electronic voting might spare postponementWhich countries are under lockdown - and is it working?Comment: The Queen\u0026#39s address left my fellow French people more than a little enviousVicars told they can ignore guidelines banning them from their own churches ahead of Easter servicePolitics latest news: Boris Johnson was working to a \u0026#39stripped back diary\u0026#39 on doctor\u0026#39s orders before his ICU admissionSurgeon is latest NHS victim to die of coronavirus Coronavirus cases in Birmingham and the Midlands, mappedCoronavirus cases in Scotland, mappedCan I go to work?

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.People were asked about changes to their personal finances, the general economy and whether they feel now is the right time to make major purchases, during interviews between 16 and 27 March.The results produced an overall negative score in the “consumer confidence barometer” from GfK of minus 34, indicating a sharp decline in confidence of 25 points from a score of minus nine in mid-March.Debenhams had been in trouble before the current crisis, which has seen all but essential shops close their doors. A year ago, the chain went through a restructuring process known as a pre-pack administration, which saw lenders take control\u0026nbspand shareholders, including Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct, wiped out.The 242-year-old company is already in the process of closing around 50 stores as it seeks to slash costs and focus on profitable sites. Of those, 22 have shut so far.Debenhams said the new administration would be “light touch”, suggesting it would not involve further, large-scale store closures but some analysts remain sceptical.“This is the first example of a so-called ‘light touch’ administration which has been promoted by practitioners to protect the company from hostile actions during the current crisis,” said David Ereira, a restructuring partner and insolvency expert at international law firm Paul Hastings. “Debenhams has, however, been in financial difficulty for some time now, so how long any new measures can keep it afloat remain to be seen.”Sean Moran, an insolvency partner at law firm Shakespeare Martineau\u0026nbspwarned that other well-known names may be forced to call in the administrators.“The government has stated its intention to facilitate cash injections and other financial assistance to businesses, recognising the imminent threat of insolvencies in many sectors,” he said. “These measures include the temporary business rates relief set out in the Budget which will benefit many smaller retailers in the short term.“It remains to be seen how quickly the processes for accessing other funds and the payment mechanisms promised will actually materialise. Cash remains king at present and those businesses without cash or access to credit lines will have massive problems.”Stefaan Vansteenkiste, the chief executive of Debenhams, said on Monday: “These are unprecedented circumstances and we have taken this step to protect our business, our employees\u0026nbspand other important stakeholders so that we are in a position to resume trading from our stores when government restrictions are lifted.“We are working with a group of highly supportive owners and lenders and anticipate that additional funding will be made available to bridge us through the current crisis period.“With their support and working with other key stakeholders, including landlords, pension trustees and business partners, we are striving to protect jobs and reopen as many Debenhams stores for trading as we can, as soon as this is possible.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Debenhams said it was preparing for all of its stores to reopen once the coronavirus lockdown conditions are eased by the government.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe company said in a statement: “This move will protect Debenhams from the threat of legal action that could have the effect of pushing the business into liquidation while its 142 UK stores remain closed in line with the government’s current advice regarding the covid-19 pandemic.”It came as\u0026nbspdata showed the increasingly heavy economic toll caused by coronavirus, with construction slumping to its worst performance since the financial crisis, new car registrations plunging by more than 40 per cent and consumer confidence dropping at its fastest pace in more than four decades.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastSome 203,000 fewer new cars were registered in March than during the same month in 2019, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. A separate report from Auto Analysis and Global Data forecast that manufacturers will lose out on $100bn (£82bn) in car sales as their factories lie dormant across Europe and North America.Meanwhile, the UK construction sector suffered its largest job cuts since 2010 after measures to stop the spread of coronavirus halted work and caused a slump in new orders.The closely watched IHS MarkitChartered Institute of Procurement and\u0026nbspSupply (CIPS)\u0026nbspconstruction purchasing managers’ index\u0026nbspdropped to 39.3 for March, from 52.6 in February. Analysts had forecast a reading of 44, with anything below 50 indicating a contraction in activity.Duncan Brock, the group director at the CIPS, said: “With no upturn in sight, and with the fastest level of lay-offs since September 2010, the sector is stuck in quicksand and sinking further.”There was more bad news for retailers too after a survey showed that consumer confidence plummeted in the last two weeks of March – a period in which some 950,000 people made new benefit claims.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It occurs when the full moon is at its closest point to Earth in its monthly orbit.On 7-8 April, the moon will get as close as 356,907km (221,772\u0026nbspmiles) to Earth, making it appear bigger and brighter in the night\u0027s sky.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe time of year means this full moon is known in folklore as the \u0027Pink moon\u0027, as it usually coincides with spring flower blossoms.The best time and date to see April\u0027s\u0026nbspsupermoon\u0026nbspis at moonrise on Tuesday and at moonset on Wednesday, when it is close to the horizon.How to take the perfect picture of the supermoon this weekThis is due to an optical illusion that makes it appear even bigger due to its relative size to buildings and objects on the horizon.\u0026nbspThe supermoon\u0027s peak illumination will take place just after\u0026nbsp6pm\u0026nbspGMT on Tuesday, though it may not be visible until after sunset.The term was first coined by astrologer Richard Nolle\u0026nbspin 1979, who defined a supermoon\u0026nbspas any full moon that was within 90 per cent of its closest approach.The coinage and use of the term has been criticised by astronomers, however some welcome it as a way to encourage interest\u0026nbspin astronomy.“Some astronomers complain about the name supermoon. They like to call supermoons hype,” astronomer and EarthSky contributor Bruce McClure wrote recently.Created with Sketch.9 best images of the 2016 supermoon Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016“But supermoons aren’t hype. They’re special. Many people now know and use the word supermoon. We notice even some diehards are starting to use it now... No doubt about it. Supermoon is a catchier term than perigean\u0026nbspfull moon.The supermoon will also have an effect on the Earth’s ocean, Mr McClure notes, with the extra gravitational pull from the moon creating extra-high\u0026nbsptides.People living along the coast will notice them one or two days after the supermoon has passed, though any risk of flooding is unlikely unless the high tides are combined with severe weather.For most parts of the UK, Tuesday and Wednesday will see exceptionally good weather with highs of up to 24C\u0026nbspin the south and east.Clear skies and reduced air pollution due to the coronavirus lockdown means April’s supermoon could be one of the best ever times to view a supermoon.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here’s how to take the perfect picture of it:Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUse a landmark to get perspectiveEveryone will be taking pictures of the supermoon by itself, but some of the best pictures show the moon next to a land mark or trees and houses, which is what helps to give the picture “a sense of place”, says Nasa’s senior photographer, Bill Ingalls. “Think of how to be creative – that means tying it into some land-based object. It can be a local landmark or anything to give your photo a sense of place.”Created with Sketch.9 best images of the 2016 supermoon Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016Pick the best spotLocation isn’t everything, but it can definitely help with getting a perfect picture of the supermoon if you have time to plan it. You can look up the best monuments or statues in your area to photograph the image of the moon against, like Mr Ingalls does in Washington D.C., where he lives. “It means doing a lot of homework. I use Google Maps and other apps – even a compass – to plan where to get just the right angle at the right time,” he told Nasa.Get the right exposureIf you’re taking a picture on your camera, control the light balance by first tapping the screen where the moon appears to get the camera to focus on the object before dragging your finger up and down to play with the exposure. “You’ll usually want to drag it down for underexposure to be sure you have all the highlight detail,” National Geographic photographer Michael Christopher Brown said.Use a tripod for your camera or rest your phone on a solid surfaceDavid Reneke, an astronomer and writer for Australian science magazine told ABC.net that if you’re using an SLR or DSLR then it’s important to play with aperture settings on your camera to photograph the supermoon, but that using a tripod is essential.It’s worth using a tripod for taking pictures with a smartphone too, as any camera shake can compromise the quality of the pictures – but if you don’t have one to hand you can simply rest your phone on a window ledge.For older smartphones that use a digital zoom rather than an optical zoom, it’s generally best not to use the zoom as it could compromise the quality of the image. Instead, take the picture and then crop it.Newer phones like the Huawei P30 and P40 series feature incredible zoom capabilities that can take detailed pictures of far away objects. Other cameras come with special features to improve pictures of the night sky, such as the Google Pixel 4’s Astro mode.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She added her reasons for visiting her second home were “not legitimate reasons to be out of my home” and understood she did not follow her own advice.“While I and my family followed the guidance on social distancing at all times, I understand that I did not follow the advice I am giving to others, and I am truly sorry for that.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I know how important this advice is and I do not want my mistake to distract from that,” added Dr Calderwood.“I have a job to do as chief medical officer to provide advice to ministers on the path of this virus and to support the medical profession as they work night and day to save lives, and having spoken with the first minister this morning I will continue to focus entirely on that job.”When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastThe apology\u0026nbspcomes after The Scottish Sun published photos of Dr Calderwood and her family near a coastal retreat in Earlsferry, more than an hour away from Edinburgh,\u0026nbsplate on Saturday.Days before, the 51-year-old posted a photo of her family at their main residence in Edinburgh on Twitter, as they joined the rest of the nation in clapping for front line NHS workers.In the daily coronavirus press briefing on Sunday, Ms Sturgeon\u0026nbspsaid: “The chief medical officer made a mistake in travelling away from her home. Whatever her reasons for doing so, it was wrong and she knows that.“All of us, including me, will make mistakes in these unprecedented times we are living in. When we do we must be candid about it and learn from it.”She said Dr Calderwood is learning from her error and has offered to do whatever is in the interests of the country, adding: “In my view, that would not be her resignation.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is vital that everyone adhere\u0026nbspto these requirements.“Police officers and staff are putting themselves in harm’s way day and night to explain these instructions to our communities, encourage co-operation and, where necessary, enforce them.”In a joint statement, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie and Wendy Chamberlain, the MSP and MP respectively for the area where Dr Calderwood has her second home, said: “It is difficult to see how the chief medical officer will be able to carry the important messages about the virus and the lockdown if she has not even followed it herself.”They added: “If we are going to get through this pandemic we need medical leaders who everyone can follow. It is with great regret that we say that the chief medical officer will need to go.”Scotland’s constitution secretary Mike Russell said there was no doubt Dr Calderwood’s visit was “ill-advised”. The\u0026nbspScottish Government confirmed it was an overnight stay to “check on a family home”.Mr Russell said she would be “answerable” for her decision when she appears at the daily coronavirus briefing with Nicola Sturgeon later today.He added: “I’m saying to everybody... do not go out except in the very exceptional circumstances that are listed, think about these things and remember by breaking them you are risking lives.”Scottish Police Federation general secretary Calum Steele said policing the pandemic had been made more difficult and stressed checking on a second home is not one of the “reasonable excuses” providing an exception to emergency coronavirus legislation.He tweeted: “In defending the indefensible has the Scottish Government not just thrown the CMO under the bus? Checking on a 2nd home is not one of the prescribed reasonable excuses.”Monica Lennon,\u0026nbspMSP for central Scotland, said in a statement on Facebook: “As the chief medical officer for Scotland, Catherine Calderwood beams that message into our homes on behalf of the government every single day, however, she has failed to practice what she preaches. Not only is this hypocritical, it is irresponsible and the first minister cannot accept this conduct.“Hundreds of Scots have died and there is no sign of the spread of the virus slowing. The CMO has undermined Scotland’s pandemic response and if she doesn’t offer her resignation the first minister should sack her.”Reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People who previously struggled with universal credit continue to do so. Rough sleepers and sofa surfers continue to live without shelter. Services that once offered support have shuttered to protect workers, while people are burning through their kitchen cupboards faster than usual because they are stuck inside.\u0026nbspIn short, many of those who have needed to use food banks in the past, those who are not among the government’s 1.5 million most at-risk people and will not be able to call on its swelling volunteer service for support, still need help.\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign aims to help give these people the support they need. Click here for ways you can help.And here are five things you might not have considered to help you to support your community’s food bank.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA common misconception is that food banks exist to offer the bare minimum – but to do so would be to completely undermine what food can give us in our day to day lives. We don’t only eat for sustenance – we do it for pleasure, to access our cultures, to engage in tradition. Food is central to the human experience, and for millennia has been key to how we experience love and affection.How to support our campaignSo ultimately think about what is going to taste good. Of course you can pick up staples that will be warmly received, but you can also donate things that get you excited, and share that excitement with someone else.Take, for example, Easter eggs. They may not be a matter of life or death, but by donating them you can give a parent the chance to treat their child, and a child the ability to engage in a communal tradition they might have been left out of. You are not just handing out subsistence, but a moment of dignity and joy for a family – and all it took was a bit of chocolate.It’s not just foodFood banks have never been just about food. Poverty is about choices – do you buy something to eat, or put money on the meter to keep the electricity running? Do you really need the heating on, or can you hold out? Will you be hungry now, or hungry later?\u0026nbspAt their most fundamental level, food banks are about a community pulling together and trying to resolve those conflicts – so when you think of donating, empathy is key. On one side of the spectrum, this means not just dredging mystery tins from the back of your cupboard – if you didn’t want to eat it over the last two years, chances are no one else will either. On the other, it’s about thinking of the groceries you couldn’t live without – be that food or something else.In the early days of the UK epidemic, among the first things to be stockpiled were hygiene products – sanitary towels, hand wash, toilet roll. If you didn’t have the ability to bulk buy, or the spare funds to travel from shop to shop by car or public transport, you were stuck. Donating bathroom products means people who use the service don’t have to choose between hunger and hygiene.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe range of reasons people visit food banks is vast, reflecting many of the social issues seen across the country, from universal credit delays to limited post-prison rehabilitation systems, rising rents and jobs that simply do not pay enough to allow for survival.\u0026nbspBut helping rough sleepers and sofa surfers out represents a unique challenge for food banks – particularly those who do not have access to kitchens and so are less likely to feel the benefit of, say, the bag of dry pasta many would receive. While volunteers will build a parcel that helps as much as possible, you can go a step further by putting together boxes of much-needed items that can be handed straight over as is.\u0026nbspAsk if your local service is interested, then get a few shoeboxes and add things that might prove useful – like socks and underwear, first aid kits, compact waterproofs, or toothbrushes and paste. Once again as much as you are donating a small box of odds and ends, you are also handing over dignity, and the tools people need to look after themselves.\u0026nbspBags of bagsFood banks across the country have had to make drastic changes to how they operate due to the virus – while volunteers may have a few contingency plans up their sleeves to keep services running, readying for a global pandemic was not among them.What has followed has been a herculean effort to organise outright change in a matter of days. Entire delivery systems have been dreamt up out of thin air, while the elderly and at risk who make up much of the volunteer base have been sent home.\u0026nbspFood banks strained as volunteers isolate and demand surgesFood banks have never been more needed, or closer to collapseFood banks in crisis as coronvirus panic buying leaves families hungryFood banks are under threat – the government has to step inUnited and City make joint food bank donation to fight coronavirusOperations have also been streamlined to feed as many people as possible, as hygienically as can be achieved. And as every service user’s food is bagged up and handed over, a small mountain of plastic bags are being deployed.So, bizarrely enough, in this time of national crisis, that bag of shopping bags that you and every other UK resident has been keeping in the corner of their kitchen or under their sink for years might finally serve a purpose. After all that time of being stored and neglected after trips to the supermarket, they could be put to use in ensuring social distancing.\u0026nbspAsk your local food bank if they could use them – but if you can go a step further and also feel a little apprehensive about contributing to the impact of plastic on the planet, consider handing over canvas bags instead. There are so many feelings wrapped into asking for help – and when you’ve been let down by the world around you time and time again, one that’s likely to come up is shame.\u0026nbspVolunteers work hard to try to mitigate that – and make the experience about support and community, but it’s easy to feel self-conscious walking away from a food bank and onto the high street with an array of clearly worn and mismatched carrier bags in your hands. A canvas bag, while sturdier, is also more discreet.Possibly the most useful thing you can do for your local food bank is among the easiest – ask what they need. While the Trussell Trust, the nation’s largest food bank charity, helps to set up and support sites, the inidual operation in your region sets its own rules and runs its own show. Others run via other charities or completely independently.\u0026nbspSo check out their tweets to see what they are appealing for, or send them an email to check what they are after, or give them a call and offer up a few hours a week to stack some tins (particularly if you are young, physically fit and don’t mind lugging around crates of produce).\u0026nbspReaching out, at every level, is fundamental to what food banks are. In reaching out you will get the satisfaction that comes from rallying around your community at a time where we’ve perhaps never been more isolated. What the person who comes to ask for food will get, from your contribution combined with others in your area coming together, is help when it’s possible no one else can.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Yet members of the public still able to help are signing up to serve a worthy cause.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMarina Nenadic, 30, is one of a several new recruits at\u0026nbspCity Harvest\u0026nbspin Acton, west London, after the food surplus charity called for more hands to sort through the produce rescued from restaurants, manufacturers and supermarket packing houses.“I’m working from home four days a week, so I had some extra time, and I really wanted to do something useful with it,” she explained. “It’s within walking distance of where I live, so I’m not taking any extra risks with journeys.”How to support our campaignMs\u0026nbspNenadic\u0026nbspis a marketing executive for\u0026nbspKew\u0026nbspGardens, but she now spends at least one day a week creating crates of food packages for the 300 smaller groups – including\u0026nbspfood banks, low-income family projects and homeless shelters – served by City Harvest.“It’s a really positive atmosphere, despite the fact it’s such difficult times. It’s actually quite exciting to see so much food come in, knowing it’s going out to people who need it. It’s been such a rewarding thing to do.”In the first two weeks of the coronavirus lockdown, City Harvest has rescued and redistributed over 130 tons of surplus food. Responding to the enormous scale of the crisis, the group has joined forces with even larger food surplus charities in the capital – our campaign partner The Felix Project and Fareshare – to create the\u0026nbspLondon Food Alliance.In a bid to make sure\u0026nbspfood gets out to those who need it\u0026nbspas efficiently as possible, the London Food Alliance is now co-ordinating with all 32 London boroughs to make sure the new, council-run community hubs are well-stocked with supplies.Liz Taylor, 61, signed up for volunteering work at The Felix Project last week, and is now packing and delivering food at\u0026nbspthe charity’s main Park\u0026nbspRoyale\u0026nbspwarehouse.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s actually a bit of relief to get outside and do something. It’s obviously worthwhile, but it’s good for my wellbeing too.”Mohamed Elmi, 34, volunteering with City Harvest for the past 18 months, says\u0026nbspsome of the Acton-based charity’s few dozen or so new volunteers have recently lost jobs in the hospitality industry.“It’s been a difficult time for them but this gives them a sense of purpose,”\u0026nbspsays Mr Elmi, who also works full-time for a homeless healthcare charity. “It’s really helped us fill in for some of the volunteers who are having to stay at home. Yes, we’re putting ourselves at risk – but this work is really needed right now.”London mayor Sadiq Khan told The Independent: “The altruism of the British people in recent days has been a beacon of hope amid the darkness of the coronavirus.”He added: “You can donate spare food at a series of hubs being set up across the city. If you can afford to, you can donate money directly to help keep the food banks open. And if you are fit and healthy, you can volunteer your much-needed time.”The Independent is asking food aid charities across the UK to contact us at helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and what problems you are facing right now.You can help us build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Candidates had effectively suspended their campaigns last month as the infections of Covid-19 started to escalate in the UK.Coinciding with Mr Corbyn’s resignation, Boris Johnson also wrote to the leaders of opposition parties at Westminster, inviting them to a briefing of senior government advisers next week as he insisted “we have a duty to work together at this moment of the national unity”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And we have to remember that every number is a family shaken to its foundation,” he said.He added: “Our willingness to come together like this as a nation has been lying dormant for too long. When millions of us stepped out onto our doorsteps to applaud the carers, visibly moved, there was hope of a better future. In times like this, we need good government, a government that saves lives and protects our country.“It’s a huge responsibility and whether we voted for this government or not, we all rely on it to get this right. That’s why in the national interest the Labour Party will play its full part.“Under my leadership we will engage constructively with the government, not opposition for opposition’s sake. Not scoring party political points or making impossible demands. But with the courage to support where that’s the right thing to do.“But we will test the arguments that are put forward. We will shine a torch on critical issues and where we see mistakes or faltering government or things not happening as quickly as they should we’ll challenge that and call that out.”Sir Keir also said he was “sorry” on behalf of the Labour Party for the “stain” that antisemitism had brought on the party in recent years after allegations that have plagued the party under Mr Corbyn’s leadership. “I will tear out this poison by its roots and judge success by the return of Jewish members and those who felt that they could no longer support us,” he added.Former leader Mr Corbyn, who had appeared with Ms Long-Bailey in her campaigning videos, also congratulated Sir Keir on his election victory. “Being Labour Party leader is a great honour and responsibility,” he said. “I look forward to working with Keir and Angela to elect the next Labour government and transform our country”.In a statement, defeated candidate Ms Long-Bailey said Sir Keir will be a “brilliant prime minister and I can’t wait to see him in No 10”, adding: “I will do all I can to make that a reality and to ensure the Labour Party gets into government with a transformative agenda at the next election.”Who will be in Starmer’s shadow cabinet?The left-wing group Momentum – set up to support Mr Corbyn’s radical, left-wing policy agenda in 2015 – said the organisation looks forward to working with him, but also pledged to hold him to account in the coming months and years.“His mandate is to build on Jeremy’s transformative vision, and this means appointing a broad shadow cabinet who believe in the policies and will work with members to make them a reality,” they added. “In this new era Momentum will play a new role. We’ll hold Keir to account and make sure he keeps his promises, champion big ideas like the Green New Deal, build the power of Labour members and do everything we can to get a Labour government elected.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People can meet each other, fall in love and have children together, then there really is a genetic problem.Our kids also have to be cautious.Karbaat - who was renowned for his successful results - always denied the mass deception, but once boasted to a reporter that he was to thank for , people living in the Netherlands.He died in  aged . DNA tests later confirmed he had fathered Inge and dozens of others, while duping their mums, in what has been dubbed one of Europes biggest ever medical frauds.In a bizarre twist of fate, Karbaat was laid to rest by the father who had raised Inge - who was completely unaware at the time that the man he was burying had fathered his own daughter.My father worked as an undertaker, explains Inge, who features in a new podcast about the scandal, The Immaculate Deception, along with some of her half-brothers and sisters.I would often call him and ask about his work. Its a small village - everybody knows everybody. One day he called me and said, Oh, the doctor has died and he will be buried on Saturday.Its so weird because my biological father was buried by my father who raised me.JAN Karbaat was a well-respected fertility doctor who ran his own medical clinic near Rotterdam, the Netherlands.He helped around , women have more than , children while operating the sperm bank between  and .However, there was a disturbing secret behind his succesful practice.The doctor was switching some donor sperm with his own before inseminating women with it, without their knowledge or consent.His actions resulted in the births of more than  half-siblings - and potentially hundreds, or even thousands, more. They also left the childrens mothers feeling betrayed when they were at their most vulnerable.Karbaat, who died in , always denied any wrongdoing, but the mass deception was revealed last year after DNA tests were made public by a Dutch court.Today, a new child of the doctor crops up every month or so. Many of the half-siblings are now friends - yet the fact there are so many of them proves worrying.Thats why I did a DNA test with my husband, just to be sure, says one.Growing up in Barendrecht - which back then had a population of just , - Inge knew of Karbaat only as a seemingly upstanding member of the community who worked in the same suburb.My family didnt tell me at all that I was donor-conceived, she recalls.But I had some suspicions because the father who raised me is very tall. All my nephews and nieces are really, really tall - yet my brother and I are dark-haired and very small!Despite being raised in a caring family, she struggled to escape the feeling there was something wrong.Of course, all teenagers think, Oh I think Im adopted because I dont want to belong in this family and I hate my parents. But the feeling didnt fade away when I hit my early s, she adds.Yet when she was , Inge received an unexpected call from her dad at work, asking her and her younger brother, then , to join him for dinner. Instantly, she knew he had big news.I was thinking, Are you ill  Is there something wrong  No, there wasnt, she says.Then I said, OK, you are going to tell me that youre not my dad  I know, its not a problem.Inge was flooded with relief as her father finally confirmed she was conceived with the help of a sperm donor.Hes still my dad - hes loved me from the moment I was born therefore he deserves all my respect and love, she says. It was really a relief when he told us.For the next decade, Inge had no idea who her biological father was. With the mystery, she says, came a kind of freedom that allowed her to dream about who the anonymous man might be.I thought, OK, the donor can be anybody - I can choose my own father. So I chose Jon Bon Jovi because I thought he was a very beautul, handsome man - I loved him! she laughs.When you then find out its Jan Karbaat, its kind of disappointing. During this time, Inge met and married her facility manager husband Wim, now , and had sons Quinten and Julien. Then, when she was , her husband spotted an advert on TV for DNA testing.By this point I was really curious about my father, Inge tells us.You could send in your DNA sample and find your biological family.Inge sent off her sample and, just a couple of weeks later, received a phone call from her half-brother, Joey Hoofdman, who had taken a similar test, put his results on a genealogy site and matched with her.Joey told me, I think Im your half-brother, lets meet, she recalls.I was really shocked. He said he was suspicious that Karbaat was his father.Inges shock was compounded by the fact that Karbaat had died just days before Joeys call, taking the truth to the grave with him. His IVF clinic had been shut down years earlier, amid falsied data allegations.Following the call, Inge met Joey in a bar halfway between their homes.She discovered the now--year-old had come across a picture of Karbaat online while researching the clinic where he knew hed been conceived through IVF - and was stunned by his likeness to the doctor.We sat there and just talked for hours. It was really funny... he doesnt look that much like me, says Inge.She later met others who also believed the doctor had fathered them.MUM-of-two Inge features in a new podast, The Immaculate Deception, hosted by journalist Jenny Kleeman, with some of her half-siblings.In the podcast, half-sister Marsha Elvers tells Jenny: I have to tell my children,you get a partner and you wanna think about children get a DNA test to make sure you’re not making children with your nephew or your cousin.Half-brother Joey adds: You’re constantly screening people in your surroundingsthey have the same resemblance andyou should be in contact, or avoided.Journalist Kamil Baluk - who carried out the last in-depth interview with Karbaat before his April  death - also appears in the podcast.He recalls asking the doctor, What do you think Mr Karbaat about donor children who are now in their twenties, thirties, they’re looking for their half-siblings, their donor fathers.Karbaat reportedly replied: I didn’t think about it at that time. I just wanted one thing, my clients had to be happy. Client pregnant, client happy, end of the story.Determined to get answers, Inge, Joey and other suspicious donor children launched a legal battle to get DNA samples of Karbaat seized from his home and compared with their own DNA - which they won.Finally, it was confirmed Inge and Joey were, in fact, related.The pair also learned they had many other half-siblings - or Karb*****ds, as some of them dub themselves.However, Inges little brother was not among the doctors children.He was conceived by an anonymous donor - we still dont know who it is, she says.While Karbaats betrayal came as a shock to Inges parents, she admits her dad wasnt too bothered by it - and was even kind of glad his daughter had inherited the genes of an intelligent doctor.She says he has, however, been supporting her hurt mum.My mother is the one who is really wronged because Karbaat knew he was using his own sperm and she didnt. I dont knowshe would have chosen him, says Inge.And though Inge, a HR business partner, doesnt bear a huge resemblance to Joey, she says she was amazed when she first came face-to-face with half-sister Marsha Elvers.I think, Oh I look like her twin sister, says Inge. Shes so similar to me. Not only in her expressions but in the way we move or say things, and our voices. Its very strange.She adds: I enjoy the fact I have so many siblings - I can choose from  people the ones that I like.But its too much, its really too much.After Inge and her husband realised the extent of Karbaats deceit, they decided Wim should take a DNA test himself. Hes American so I didnt think he was family but he did take a test to be sure, says Inge.Its a decision they know Quinten and Julien will be faced with in the future, too.During his insemination spree, Karbaat advised his patients never to tell their children they were conceived by sperm donors - yet, after her own dficult experience, Inge urges parents to do the opposite.Its really better to know youre from a donor from a young age, rather than find out when youre  or in your s, she says. I really hope children are spared the dficulties we had during our childhood.She also says couples desperate for children should think twice before using an anonymous donor.While anonymous sperm and egg donation practices are now banned in the UK, and the Netherlands, theyre still allowed in some countries, prompting desperate couples to go on donation holidays abroad.But Inge, who still lives in South Holland, warns: Its so dficult for your child to grow up in an environment in which they know theres a secret and theres something wrong and they only find out later.Today, the mums own anger towards the secret that plagued her childhood has faded.It doesnt matter anymore because Karbaat is dead, she says.We will never get answers.And she can even appreciate what the doctor gave her - albeit, surreptitiously.He has given me le and Im enjoying it, she says.

And we have a National Health Service to look after those who need care.A mobilisation never before seen in peacetime is under way across our health service and beyond. In the NHS our dedicated staff are pulling out all the stops to treat the patients we have and prepare for the surge we know is coming.We are now looking after more than , patients in hospital with confirmed coronavirus — a staggering increase compared with just a few weeks ago.That is more coronavirus patients than the number of hospitalised heart attack, stroke and cancer patients combined.And in a matter of weeks hospitals have managed to free up a further , beds, a third of all those normally available, for future patients with coronavirus.Of course, most patients the health service is continuing to look after have some condition other than coronavirus.And it is important that other patients still come forward for the urgent and emergency care they need without delay.Increasing our critical care capacity for those who are sickest is a top priority.And we are setting up new hospitals at a rate never seen before.The new NHS Nightingale in London is the most visible example of the extraordinary effort that is under way to tackle coronavirus.The NHS has joined forces with the military to achieve in days what normally takes years.More such hospitals are in train across the country — in Bristol, in Yorkshire, in Birmingham and in Manchester. I hope they won’t be needed, but we’re building them in case they are.They are an insurance policy in case the surge plans at existing hospitals are not enough.But these new facilities and kit are nothing without the staff that make the NHS what it is today — the institution our nation rightly holds most dear.More than , former nurses, doctors and other NHS staff have heeded the call to re-enlist for the battle against coronavirus.And many thousands of student nurses and medical students will be putting their skills and education into practice early as part of the enormous effort that is under way to save more lives.But the NHS cannot win this war alone. Companies and the Government are now pulling together to get us the extra equipment and supplies the NHS needs. British manufacturers are retooling production lines to turn out protective kit for doctors, nurses and other staff, giving their all on the front line.Commercial rivalries are being put aside as firms co-operate to develop new ventilators and other vital supplies.Labs are expanding their testing capacity, so NHS staff knowthey can safely get back to work.The public are backing our staff at this time of enormous pressure.I know how much it means to the nurses, doctors, therapists, cleaners, pharmacists, paramedics and countless others giving their all to fight coronavirus that the whole nation is behind them in this battle.The support of Sun readers will help sustain them in the days and weeks ahead.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here thesun whocareswinsappealSo on behalf of the NHS, a thank you too to The Sun, for throwing its weight behind the Clap for Carers campaign to give NHS heroes the recognition they deserve.But the practical actions that iniduals and families take in the weeks ahead will also make all the dference.As other countries have shown, no health service in the world could cope with the number of patients who would need treatmentbetween us we failed to slow the spread of coronavirus.That is why the Government’s measures to stop people meeting and passing on the virus are so important.Nobody is finding this easy — whether it is missing a drink with friends in the pub, Sunday lunch with the family or uncertainty over jobs and wages this epidemic has created for so many.There are early signs this is working but this is a marathon not a sprint. What we need to remember is that right now every single one of us can be a le-saver just by following the medical advice.Every time you wash your hands you could keep someone off of a ventilator. Over the coming weeks, by staying at home you save lives. It’s as simple and as profound as that.

Since Boris Johnson declared the lockdown restrictions on our lives, officers have been accused by some of being overzealous enforcing them.They have tried to stop some shops selling Easter eggs because they consider them non-essential.A cop was also filmed threatening to fine a bakery owner for putting chalk on the pavement outside her shop to maintain social-distancing.Meanwhile, the Derbyshire force dyed black the Blue Lagoon swim spot in a disused Buxton quarry to deter groups from gathering there — and sent out drones to spy on walkers in the middle of nowhere.Road blocks have been set up to check motorists and cyclists are on essential journeys.Last weekend officers were also breaking up groups of more than two people on park benches, and football matches in parks.All of which could seem a tad heavy-handed.So you can see why some people are indignant, especially given the absence of clearer official guidance.Perhaps it is this lack of clarity that is partly the issue.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a recent daily press conference that police should use common sense in applying the rules and that the public should follow the guidance not just to the letter but also the spirit.The real issue, though, is some people’s inability to follow the very basic instruction to stay at home unless they really need to go out.If people were not disregarding this advice, police would not have to enforce it.Officers do need to be careful, though.We are willing to social-distance for the greater good but only as long as it is necessary — and will not tolerate it for a minute longer.We are not a police state and the police must be mindful of being too heavy-handed.So while shouting at someone for buying an Easter egg is ridiculous and using a drone to terrorise a lone dog walker does seem extreme, someone has to break up the cretins who are having barbecues or parties in high-density residential areas, right I do despair over the attitude of those mindless idiots who are still having parties and getting drunk together.Then there are the twits going to DIY shops to buy paint, which is hardly essential.People, this is not an extended Bank Holiday.

It’s a hard thing to do.”Lucy’s face should haunt us all.Remember it every time some thick-as-mince footballer wraps his expensive motor around a lamppost.Remember Lucy’s face every time you see people who think social isolation rules do not apply to them.Remember Lucy’s faceyou want to understand what a long way we have to go before we truly start supporting the NHS.Yes, it is hard for a people raised in freedom to obey these restrictive rules.But NOBODY has a harder job right now than those NHS workers who are risking their lives in under-equipped, overcrowded hospitals that are being pushed to breaking point and beyond.The health crisis is unprecedented in our letime but the Government cannot keep cocking it up.The NHS does not have the kit it needs, the testing it needs, the support it needs.Health Secretary Matt Hancock promises , coronavirus tests a day by the end of April.If Hancock does not deliver, get shot of him.Because right now, that “Protect the NHS” slogan is looking heartbreakingly empty.All foreign NHS workers who are out there now fighting on the frontline deserve British passports.If these foreign heroes are good enough to risk their lives to save our lives, then they have earned the right to stay in the UK for ever.CLAUDIA Schfer tells Elle magazine that at the height of her supermodel glory days she felt like a rock star.

and Covid- attacks the respiratory system, health officials say.They also point to a small but highly impactful survey from China which finds that smokers with Covid- are  times more likely to develop severe disease.The study looked at the factors which led to the progression of Covid- pneumonia in patients at three hospitals in Wuhan, China -

Honesty.She promised viewers it “might be a bit rough around the edges”, and has been utterly faithful to her word, starting last Monday, when Steph went hurtling round her house to show off the remote cameras and then spent the next ten minutes gasping for air.Over the following  minutes, Skype links maled, mobile phones went off and an attempt to kick off a feature about weird dreams, with Keith Lemon, was shut down as quickly as it started.“What did you ask Michael Hutchence in your dream ”“Things he did romantically with Kylie Minogue that . . . ” “OK, let’s move on.”Had you thought day two was going to improve things, you probably banished those thoughts when Steph began with her own epitaph: “If you tuned in yesterday, you’ll know this is the show that isn’t meant to be on yet.”Or any other day for that matter, although Tuesday’s episode was a technical cracker and climaxed when someone rang Steph’s doorbell, mid-episode.

It applies evenparents would have otherwise kept their jobs during the crisis. That means parents swamped by childcare can ask to temporarily quit work and have % of their wage paid by the state, up to £, a month, eventheir job was viable during Covid-. Experts welcomed the move - branding it an escape hatch for parents whoaposve been struggling to work while looking after children in a confined home.  But they said it should go further - and Universal Credit and child benefit must be raised further to help parents through the crisis.The government updated its guidance to companies and workers on the furlough scheme on Saturday. It now says: Employees who are unable to work because they have caring responsibilities resulting from coronaviruscan be furloughed. For example, employees that need to look after children can be furloughed. The governmentaposs statement doesnapost meanallparents who are juggling kids and work can go on furlough. And it doesnapost mean all parentshave togo on furloough either.But officials said it would give struggling parents the option to ask their bosses for time off. Any arrangement would have to be agreed between the company and the worker. If a worker goes on furlough, they have to do no work at all. They cannot switch to being part-time. If they want more than % of their salary, their company has to agree to do this voluntarily.  Clare McNeil, associate director of the IPPR think tank, said she was delighted at the change. She said: Caring for children should be recognised for what it is, a full-time occupation. This is a vital recognition from the government of the place that caring for others has in our society, alongside paid employment. This change could make a real dference to those who face dficulties in combining working with caring for children, including single parents, those with a child with special educational needs or a disability, and those with very young children or babies. Many people with additional caring responsibilities for adults as a result of the Coronavirus outbreak, including for older relatives, will also benefit from this change.

Michael Gove said giving details of the process would help Britainaposs enemies after he was quizzed about the grave possibility - however unlikely it might be. It comes after Mr Johnson handed power temporarily to First Secretary of State Dominic Raab while he fights for le with Covid- in St Thomasapos Hospital. Mr Raab will lead the governmentaposs coronavirus response and chair todayaposs .am meeting - but decisions will be taken collectively by Cabinet.Cabinet Office minister Mr Gove was asked in two dferent interviews today who would lead the response to a nuclear attack. He insisted there are well developed protocols which have been tested robustly over time, but told ITVaposs Good Morning Britain: I am refusing to answer the question. Mr Gove said it was right to ask the question but added: When it comes to things like national security we donapost speculate about stuff like that. I know you will think aposoh, this is just another politician whoaposs refusing to answer the questionapos. Well I am refusing to answer the question, because there are established protocols that cover national security questions. We donapost talk about them in a way which might give people who are our enemies any chance to circumvent them.  More generally, the case does raise legitimate questions about Britainaposs laws, which do not explicitly set out what happensthe Prime Minister is incapacitated. Mr Gove said: Dominic Raab is in charge - we donapost talk about national security matters. Mr Gove also refused to answer the same question on BBC Radio aposs Today programme. Askedthe PM’s responsibilities for national security, including a nuclear attack, have passed to Dominic Raab, he said: “I simply can’t talk about national security matters. “There are well developed protocols which are in place and have been tested robustly over time.” One of a Prime Minsteraposs first tasks is to write “the letter of last resort” - four identical handwritten notes to the commanders of Britainaposs nuclear-armed Vanguard submarines. They outline the UKaposs response to a nuclear attack. However, further details of the UKaposs response are less publicly-known than in the US, where the nuclear weapons codes are constantly carried in a specially-designed briefcase in close proximity to the President. AskedMr Raab will be able to hire and fire ministers, Mr Gove said: “The Prime Minister always remains the Prime Minister. “But I don’t think there’s any suggestion of anything other than a great team spirit in government as we all work together at this time - ministers and expert advisors and civil servants.” Mr Gove insisted major decisions - including whether to ease or end the lockdown “will be taken collectively and they will be taken following appropriate advice”. He added: “This disease can hit any of us and when it hits, it can hit very badly.” Boris Johnsonaposs condition remained unchanged this morning at St Thomasapos Hospital.  He is thought to have have received a Continuous Positive Airway Pressurebreathing aid.But allies this morning said Boris Johnson is not yet on a full mechanical ventilator - which is the next step.Mr Gove told LBC Radio: Heaposs not on a ventilator no.

Mr Starmeraposs made his former leadership rival Rebecca Long-Bailey Shadow Education Secretary. She vowed: In this time of crisis I will do my utmost to ensure that our teaching staff, students and their families receive the support they deserve.

He spoke in Parliament of the trauma of having to care for his dad who was too drunk to buy food or walk him home from school. In the run up to the the  election, a recording of Mr Ashworth was published, in which he criticised Jeremy Corbyn, said he did not believe Labour would win the election and described the situation for colleagues campaigning in the north of England as dire.

The Labour MP also said Angela Rayner would make a “fantastic deputy leader”. John Healey - Shadow Defence Secretary  After years spent as working on Labouraposs Housing policy, Mr Healey gets a big promotion to cover Defence.

Former Energy Secretary Mr Miliband, , said: We must all focus on playing our part in the countryaposs response to coronavirus, working with government to help the many businesses and workers who have been so badly hit and need their voice heard. As Keir has said, we cannot go back to business as usual after this crisis. “We will need to reshape our economy, addressing the insecurity many millions of workers face. We must alsoto climate change as the unavoidable long-term issue of our time, including with a recovery based on providing economic justice through a Green New Deal. Jonathan Reynolds - Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary  The former Shadow Economic Secretary gets a big promotion to take on the governmentaposs handling on Welfare. A detailed and wide ranging brief it is somewhere that detailed scrutiny can make a dference between a policy change that can mean le or death for those most in need. Jo Stevens - Shadow Digital, Culture, Media and Sport  Jo Stevens was made Shadow Culture Secretary after former Coronation Street actress Tracy Brabin was sacked.

A team has been tasked with drafting options where restrictions would be lted only when the number of new hospital admissions begins to drop, it is reported. When Boris Johnson announced the lockdown two weeks ago, he said the unprecedented measures would be in place until April  and then reviewed, but no change is expected next week. The death toll has soared amid signs that the infection rate is starting to slow, although the peak of Britainaposs epidemic wonapost come for another two to three weeks. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. The Prime Minister was undergoing tests in hospital as he continues to suffer from Covid- symptoms  days after contracting the new strain of coronavirus. It comes as ministers discuss how and when to ease the lockdown when the number of new hospital admissions begin to fall, the Times reported. Treasury officials had warned thatthe lockdown went beyond June the Government would not be able to prevent profitable industries from going bust. The Treasury has asked health and business civil servants to come up with scenarios for lting the restrictions in stages.  It could be done by region, industrial sector or by expanding the list of key workers, the report added. The exit strategy is expected to include an dramatic increase in community testing. The Government has already pledged to carry out , tests a day by the end of April and it is still committed to its goal of , tests a day. A spokeswoman for No toldthe Government will review the measures after three weeks and it has not set out any further timeline of when the lockdown could end. Downing Street said there is a huge amount of work going on to develop an exit strategy to ease the lockdown. Thereaposs a huge amount of work ongoing on this but itaposs vital that we remain focused on stopping the spread of this disease, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said. And that we donapost lose sight of that now or somehow think we can stop following the guidance. Weaposre at a critical point and itaposs vital that we keep going. In the meantime, Health Secretary Matt Hancock is urging Britons to continue to follow the lockdown and social distancing rules in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. After police broke up picnics and forced sunbathers to move on at parks and beaches during a warm and sunny weekend, Mr Hancock warned that tougher restrictions on outdoor exercise would be imposedpeople continue to flout lockdown rules. The Health Secretary also denied a rt with Chancellor Rishi Sunak amid claims that there have been clashes at the top of Government over the exit strategy. The Chancellor is reportedly pushing for a path to be mapped out towards lting the restrictions to help limit damage to the economy.  New Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called on the Government to publish its exit strategy so that Britons know what it is, when the restrictions might be lted and what the plan is for economic recovery. Neil Ferguson, a professor at Imperial College in London, said the epidemic was expected to plateau in the next seven to  days. He said cases had to come down to a low point before measures such as increased testing and contact tracing could replace some of the lockdown restrictions. What is the UKaposs exit strategy  Thoughts are turning to how the UK will end its period of lockdown and start the transition back to normal le. No precise exit strategy has yet been formed, though Professor Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College, who is advising the Government, said experts are looking at it in detail this week. Ending the lockdown will rely on a substantial slowdown in the epidemic of Covid- - the so-called flattening the curve - and a downward trend, which has not yet happened in the UK. The number of deaths is also still rising as the UK moves towards the peak of its epidemic, which is expected within the next week to  days.

Will the virus come back  The virus is still out there. Just letting people resume their normal lives all at once will undoubtedly lead to a second wave of coronavirus cases and the re-introduction of severe restrictions. So, the aim is to gradually lt the lid on controls while watching what happens with the spread of Covid- in the community. If cases can be kept to a lower level - and the NHS can cope with them - then restrictions may slowly be lted. This could include a series of short releases, such as lting controls by region or by asking vulnerable people and those most at risk to continue staying at home. It could involve schools reopening or some businesses being allowed to open their doors. What about testing  Experts agree that much more testing is needed to get the UK out of lockdown. At present, the UK has no real grip on how many people are currently infected and what proportion may already be immune to the disease.

It follows reports of arsonists setting fire to masts and theories blaming the virus on mobile phone signals. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “The Secretary of State is due to speak with some of the big social media firms later on this week to be very clear about the need to stop the spread of what is a crazed conspiracy theory. “You have seen reports of criminal vandalism against G masts. “People need to understand that by destroying these masts, they’re actually putting lives at risk because these are masts which emergency responders rely upon.” Julian Knight, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee said: “To hear that crackpot theories are leading to people attacking phone masts or threatening telecom workers is sickening and it’s clearly time to act. “We’ve called on the Government to work with social media companies to stamp out deliberate attempts to spread fear about COVID- and it is right that they are being called to account for allowing disinformation on their s. “We’re also calling on Ofcom to investigate whether international news organisations are using social media to disseminate state-backed disinformation on COVID- in order to get around UK broadcasting regulation.” Mobile phone masts have in recent days been vandalised and telecoms staff abused in Birmingham in central England and Merseyside in northern England, damaging connectivity at a time when people are relying on it more than ever. An arson attack at a tower in Birmingham owned by BT, Britainaposs biggest telecoms company, caused signicant damage. It provided G, G and G services to thousands of people, but did not have G capability, the company said.

It was just the fth time in her -year reign that she has addressed the nation in this way, and a huge amount of planning went into the historical speech. It was filmed at Windsor Castle, where the Queen has been self-isolating with her husband Prince Philip, and a mammoth undertaking was needed to facilitate the unprecedented statement. Before the recording the Queen sought her personal doctorsapos advice, which was strictly followed to mitigate any risk to the monarch or others at the castle. Sources with knowledge of the recording suggested the logistics and planning had been made “particularly dficult” due to the nationwide lockdown and fears over the risks to the Queen’s health after she entered isolation on government advice. The video message was recorded by a lone cameraman, who was dressed from head to toe in the same personal protective equipment worn by doctors and nurses treating infected patients.  The White Drawing Room was specically chosen as it allowed appropriate distance between those involved at all times. The Queen wrote the speech with the help of her private secretary Sir Edward Young, who is one of her most trusted aides. A source said: Her Majesty wanted to make particular reference to her very first broadcast in , when she was just a young girl who had been evacuated from Buckingham Palace as Nazi bombs rained down on London. The Queen must have felt it quite pertinant that the coronavirus crisis, which has kept so many away from their family and friends, had drawn parallels with her own experience of living through the war as an evacuee.She worked closely with Number  on her speech, and care was taken to ensure the timing of her important message was right.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are understood to be working on plans to run emotional support groups and even a multi-media educational empire. The couple, who fled the UK to set up home in Canada before moving once more to Hollywood said on Monday night they wanted the organisation “to do something of meaning, to do something that matters”. The Sussexes were forced to abandon their ambitious plans to launch a foundation under the name ‘Sussex Royal’ after the Queen banned them from using the term royal after they sensationally quit The Firm.  The Duke and Duchess told the Daily: Like you, our focus is on supporting efforts to tackle the global Covid- pandemic but faced with this information coming to light, we felt compelled to share the story of how this came to be.“Before SussexRoyal, came the idea of ‘Arche’ - the Greek word meaning ‘source of action’. “We connected to this concept for the charitable organisation we hoped to build one day, and it became the inspiration for our son’s name.  To do something of meaning, to do something that matters. “Archewell is a name that combines an ancient word for strength and action, and another that evokes the deep resources we each must draw upon. We look forward to launching Archewell when the time is right. The couple have reportedly previously considered iations on the name including Arche Foundation and Archeway. Official documents seen by the newspaper give a fascinating insight into the ambitions of the Sussexes.  The couple have officially left behind plans to launch a charitable foundation in the UK in favour of an American “non-profit”. Having emphasised their commitment to the Commonwealth and moved for a short while into a borrowed Canadian mansion, they are now living and working in Los Angeles. According to paperwork filed in the United States last month, the couple are planning to create their own charity and volunteering services, wide-ranging website, and sharing “education and training materials” via films, podcasts and books.  Plans, which so far include trademark requests for everything from motion picture films to paperclips. Sources suggest the plans are far more extensive than those originally intended under Sussex Royal in the UK - where they had also spent thousands of pounds trademarking hundreds of items from notepads to bandanas. Meghan, , could build on her previously successful lestyle blog called The Tig, with a “website featuring information in the field of nutrition, general health and mental health”, along with entertainment.

This is their decision, but I have asked them to be very judicious in taking that step and only to do that where they feel it is impossible to maintain social distancing rules within their parks or open spaces, he told BBC Radio aposs Today programme.

In response, councillor Gerald Vernon-Jackson, chairman of the Local Government Associationaposs culture, tourism and sport board said they are well aware of the importance of open spaces to people who are only allowed out once a day. He said: This is a national emergency and the minority of people who do not adhere to the guidance need to change their behaviour to keep us all safe. Councils are constantly monitoring the situation regarding our parks. Councils know that parks are a leline for residents needing to get some exercise or fresh air and are great for physical and mental wellbeing.This is why councils want to keep parks open, but people need to follow the social distancing advice, otherwise councils will be reluctantly forced to close them as a last resort to help prevent the coronavirus spreading."},{"url":null,"title":"new report shows grim survival","story":"NewsNew report shows grim survival rate for coronavirus patients in intensive careThe report released by Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centreuses information from all confirmed coronavirus cases reported to the organisation in England, Wales and Northern IrelandShare uses information from all confirmed coronavirus cases reported to the organisation in England, Wales and Northern Ireland\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Screen-Shot----at-.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\" uses information from all confirmed coronavirus cases reported to the organisation in England, Wales and Northern Ireland\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Screen-Shot----at-.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\" uses information from all confirmed coronavirus cases reported to the organisation in England, Wales and Northern Ireland\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Screen-Shot----at-.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\"CommentsByLorraine King:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsMedics treating coronavirus patients in intensive care\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

The worker was asymptomatic so not showing any symptoms, the zoo said. Dr Sarah Caddy, Veterinarian and Clinical Research Fellow, University of Cambridge, said the reports was not wholly unexpected as new research suggests domestic cats can be infected with the viruslarge doses are administered into their noses. She said: However, it is surprising that the tiger has become infected with what must have been a fairly low dose of virus - we can assume the tiger did not have continual close contact with the asymptomatic zookeeper. And she added: What does this mean for our pet cats  Nothing new - at present there is still only one suspected case where an owner has spread the virus to their pet. It is possible that tigers in captivity are more susceptible to the virus than household moggies as there is a % dference between their genomes. The bottom line is that there is no evidence that any cat, large or small, can transmit the virus back to humans.

I was free to talk to clubs.“I spoke to Mark McGhee at Motherwell and Gus MacPherson at St Mirren.“The chance to go to England and play for that club [Coventry] came up and it was a no-brainer really.“My agent and I sat down…we didn’t need to think about it.“There were other reasons why it was more beneficial for me – you’re trying to make a living in your career.“I had three top-flight teams up here who I had the chance to go to.“Lee Wilkie was at Dundee United at the time.

It is our experience, thus far, that this country’s handling of the crisis exceeds others in the mitigation of losses for businesses as well as iniduals.“In the coming days we will be implementing elements of the job retention scheme in respect of our staff and it is our intention that all are looked after fully throughout this crisis.“This includes our football players, football staff and administrative staff receiving full pay while they are on furlough for the foreseeable future.”Hello to all of the Dundee fans from all over the globe!  We hope this update finds everyone safe and well during these unprecedented and unimaginable times.  This, I have to say, is the strangest and scariest period, certainly of my letime and it has brought to the forefront, that, despite all of our dferences , we are truly all in this together and as such, we will get through this together.We at Dundee Football Club have been constantly monitoring the situation we find ourselves in due to the COVID- virus and have been taking advice, giving guidance, and implementing protocols to keep our staff, patrons and partners safe and sound as we ensure the sustainability of the club.First of all, the club do indeed have Business Interruption Insurance with specic additions of Notiable Diseases and Prevention of Access to our Commercial Combined Insurance Policy which should allow us to have options to reimburse those losses incurred due to the cancellation of matches. It would be our intention,the season is brought to an early conclusion, where practical, to reimburse those season ticket holders for the remainder of the season that was not played.  This will be further assessed for timelines, etc., as we make our way through the claims process. We have often said that the club is a family and that remains true throughout this situation.In addition to our insurance coverage, we have also sought to access ious sources of support offered by the League, the Association, Government agencies and our associates.  All that have been involved have been extremely helpful in our solidication of the club as a business.  I would like to personally thank John Bennett for his very generous and selfless gesture of suspending rent on the stadium. His call, on day one of this crisis helped to set the tone for all that followed throughout this shutdown and is the epitome of showing how we are all in this together.The UK Government and its agencies have also been extremely helpful in the offering of grants loans and providing relief through the Job Retention Scheme.  That includes HMRC. It is our experience, thus far, that this country’s handling of the crisis exceeds others in the mitigation of losses for businesses as well as iniduals.  In the coming days we will be implementing elements of the job retention scheme in respect of our staff and it is our intention that all are looked after fully throughout this crisis. This includes our football players, football staff and administrative staff receiving full pay while they are on furlough for the foreseeable future.We also think it is right to give credit to the dedicated workers at the SPFL and SFA. They have been working in an ever-changing landscape throughout this unprecedented event. They have continued to keep us informed and provide us advice on how to best navigate this predicament. They have freely shared the advice and guidance they are receiving from the government and UEFA as we all feel our way through these weeks. We continue to take advice and express our opinions on what football should look like when football resumes. Although none of us know yet what will transpire with this season, it is clear that football will be back.We’ve been inundated with requests on how people can help the club.  It’s truly been heart-warming. The one way to helpyou can – and onlyyou can # is to purchase season tickets and merchandise online.  We still have limited availability of this year’s Third Strip, which may become a collector’s item as it may never be worn.This supports the club as well as SSAFA and The Black Watch Association charities.  We will soon be launching our - kit in the upcoming days and we know it’s not enough to completely fill your appetite for football, but keep an eye on the social media sites for Dundee FC and DFC in the Community, which will provide some entertainment while we all do our part to save lives by staying home.We wish we had something more definitive to say, but we hope this brief update will provide some reassurance that we are still here and will remain here when this crisis is over. So from all of us at Dundee Football Club, please stay safe, keep your families safe, that is the most important thing and know that we are all in this together and we will come through this together!"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/medw-rainbow-caroline-stephenson-2-846x564.jpg ","title":"gallery your second batch of selfie islation photos do you see anyone you know","story":"These are tough times, but amid all the doom and gloom the Tele is determined to put a smile on your face.That’s why we want you to send us your “selfie-isolating” pics!These could be photos of your home-schooling efforts, rainbows you have made to brighten up your windows, fun family activities you are taking part in or even just a pic of your favourite pet.Caroline Stephenson’s daughter Poppy, , had the idea of painting rainbows to display in her window as a symbol of hope, and dozens of you have been in touch with your own ‘selfie isolating’ pictures, many of which include rainbows.Above is a selection of some of the pictures we’ve been sent already.

Riverside was a shock for them on a December morning and certainly not what a guy like Caniggia was used to!“Caniggia, Ravanelli, Ketsbaia, all the top names that came into the club were brand new. They were great lads, they really were.“It was a bit surreal training against these boys. I was a bit stand-offish because I had a reputation of being a little rash and I wasn’t going to smash Caniggia in training!“He was just left to do his thing and you gave him the respect he deserves.“He basically got to do whatever he wanted around the club. Nobody was going to tell Caniggia he couldn’t do something!“We’d be at training and his five-year-old son would be up with us. We’d be doing a shooting exercise and running out of balls because Caniggia’s son had six at the side kicking them about!”Wilkie also revealed Caniggia’s free reign didn’t stop there and the Argentine was known to enjoy a pre-match cigarette in the Dens Park dressing room.He said: “We had the one cubicle in the changing-room and I used to like my pre-match toilet to just chill out and read the programme to get my mind ready for the game.“I’d always have to wait on Caniggia coming out the toilet because he’d be in there smoking a rolly-up.“He used to just come out with a wee smile on his face, shrug his shoulders and walk past you but that was just the kind of guy he was.“The Italians and the Argentines were horried the British boys would drink beer but they would smoke asit was the healthiest thing going.“They were really fit, though. Caniggia was probably the fittest guy I played with and fans could see that when he scored his first goal against Aberdeen and took his top off.“He was so strong for his age and looked after himself really well.“He was one of the biggest players in the world and it was amazing he was at Dundee.”It was a crucial time in Wilkie’s career but bust-ups with the Bonettis led to him going on loan to Plymouth Argyle, Notts County and Falkirk.But he found his way back to Dens, impressing then-Scotland manager Berti Vogts enough to get a call-up to the national team.“It was dficult for me because I was young and fiery and they were exactly the same,” Wilkie said of clashing with the Bonettis.“I had a couple of fall-outs with them that really came from nothing. It’s disappointing how it ended up because I really quite liked them.“Dario really knew his stuff as a coach and, as an ex-defender, he used to take us away to do bits and pieces in training.“I really enjoyed that. The two times I fell out with them were from silly little things in training that shouldn’t have happened.“My loan moves then came from the fall-outs but I got called back from Falkirk because they’d fallen out with Marco De Marchi and Fan Zhiyi.“When I was on loan at Notts County I’d pretty much given up. I was close to deciding I was done with football because I was fed up.“I was in a bad place. I got injured down there in my first or second game, sat stuck in a hotel and I thought that was me done.“I was only  so I was just a bit naive and immature I guess. Getting back to enjoying the game was about  per cent luck.“I was playing for Falkirk, doing OK and enjoying it in a young team in the First Division with boys like Mark Kerr and Lee Miller.“My head was still pretty much gone from the previous couple of months. But with the Bonnetis falling out with almost all the centre-halves at Dundee bar one, I was back in.“I got on well with [former Dundee owner] Peter Marr and he liked me as a player so persuaded Ivano to bring me back.“I went back and played about six games towards the end of that season and Berti showed up to watch me put in two man-of-the-match displays.“Next minute I’m called up for Scotland.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/457db997-39ba-49f0-af8f-1de57815c025-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/457db997-39ba-49f0-af8f-1de57815c025-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/457db997-39ba-49f0-af8f-1de57815c025-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/457db997-39ba-49f0-af8f-1de57815c025-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"lee wilkie dundee fc dundee united out of contract","story":"I have to say I feel for players at Dundee and United right now – especially those out of contract this summer.It’s a horrible situation for a lot of people in their jobs right now with no real knowledge of what is going to happen and footballers are no dferent.It is a job at the end of the day, a good one and one a lot of people would love to have.But, just like everyone , players have families and bills to pay. That goes for the clubs, too.That’s why I’m not surprised both the Dark Blues and the Tangerines have opted to use the government’s furlough scheme – they are businesses and they have to do what is right to ensure they stay afloat during this time when there’s no income.Like a lot of people in the city right now, that will bring a whole lot of worry to workers for what the future holds post-coronavirus.Not knowing where the next wage is coming from is a dreadful situation to be in.There are players at both clubs whose contracts end in a couple of months and they have my every sympathy.I’ve been through similar in my playing career and that uncertainty is probably the worst feeling you can have as a professional.Going through administration at Dundee was a dferent sort of situation but I ended up coming out of it with that question of how I was going to pay my bills.Back then I was prepared to take a wage cut to help the club but it was decided that wouldn’t be enough and I left Dens Park.EXCLUSIVE: Lee Wilkie on starring alongside Claudio Caniggia at Dundee, Argentina star#s unusual pre-match ritual and representing Scotland\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp

finished rehab on my knee and wasn’t even sure I’d be able to play on anyway.Thankfully, Dundee United gave me a chance, though the uncertainty continued even so.I wasn’t sure my knee would hold up and they gave me a contract from September to June on £ per week – a far cry from the million-pound lestyle people associate with some footballers.There was an appearance fee on top but spending time on loan at Ross County meant I couldn’t get that and it was a really tough time in my career.Right now, there are worse things going on in the world with people’s health but adding the stress and worry of work problems just piles on top for a lot of people.I think the move to furlough staff for the time being is a sensible one for both city clubs.What the players are desperate for now is some sort of certainty from the powers-that-be.The UK Government has gone to town on footballers this week completely unfairly.They are an easy target right now.I understand why people think players should front up and take pay cuts to either help non-playing staff at clubs or the NHS or whatever.However, they all seem to be lumped in the same bracket when only a small percentage of professional footballers earn millions of pounds.Boys playing for clubs like Dundee or United or St Mirren, Hamilton etc are not earning fortunes and they have bills to pay like everybody .I think everyone should be doing their bit to help during the coronavirus pandemic, whether that’s through paying taxes or some sort of voluntary work, but it seems like footballers have been called out because they are an easy target.There are plenty of people across the country earning big bucks but not getting hammered.A better way to go about it would have been to say to players exactly what their club needs to save and to give an option to donate part of their salary to the NHS.It seems a weekly occurrence at the moment that we see an SPFL meeting as the time decisions will finally be made.I’m not holding my breath too much for this one tomorrow but you never know.I saw Celtic put out they want to finish the season but they are in a position where they can take the high ground.Everyone has their own agenda but what we really need, what clubs and players need, is some idea of how Scottish football will continue.Cheering on the Virtual Grand National over the weekend was about as close to sporting excitement as you can get at the moment.I didn’t have much luck in my sweepy – my virtual horse fell over a virtual hurdle#"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/457db997-39ba-49f0-af8f-1de57815c025-240x180.jpg

maxwell","story":"It’s been a long week of rumour and speculation since the last update we had from the SFA and the SPFL.What that radio silence hammers home most to me is a lack of leadership and decisiveness.Don’t get me wrong, I have sympathy for Ian Maxwell, Neil Doncaster  Co.This is a very complicated situation where you are unlikely to please everyone because so many doors could open up in dferent directions for clubs in terms of the current season and ongoing league structure.It melts your mind a bit when you start thinking about all the possibilities and how it could affect people but there needs to be a decision made soon.Uefa won’t do it for them, nor will Fa or English football, they need to grab the bull by the horns and show a bit of leadership.The resolution for all of this starts with them so it’s important they’re clear with their message.There’s no way they could possibly keep everybody happy but they must do something decisively and quite quickly to protect clubs and their incomes.I think most football people, myself included, would like to see the season played to a finish – eventhat is behind closed-doors.However, it’s beginning to look like we won’t see that happening at all given the current health guidelines from the UK and Scottish Governments pointing towards a longer lockdown being put in place across the country.August has been touted as the date for ato domestic football and, like I have said before, although it will be a long four months, it could be a good opportunity to restructure our gamedone correctly.It’s definitely an option and, depending on how it looks, I might even prefer that to closed-doors games.Reshuffling the leagues and increasing the number of teams will be refreshing and I think most fans would back that.Most of the clubs would be fairly happy, too, with no relegations across all four isions and promotion for the top two sides in the lower leagues.There may be some disputes about the tighter leagues and promotion play-offs but you’d like to think most would understand the extraordinary nature of the situation.Dundee would probably have been able to push Inverness right to the end and might feel a bit hard done by but it’s a really dficult one.I don’t envy the high heidyins but they’re paid to make these calls.The biggest thing that needs to be cleared up as soon as possible, for me, is the financial aspect of the shutdown.Clubs have been left in limbo by the powers that be for too long already.Many don’t have any income at all while there are still so many question marks about how they will access adequate monies from the SPFL and the SFA.It’s really important they decide what’s happening as soon as they can because clubs need to move on and plan for, what looks like, months ahead without any football.There’s so much work to do, it’s a bit of a head spinner.At this stage we’re not even taking into account the transfer window where, Dundee United in particular may be able to raise cash.I’m sure there will already have been plenty of enquiries about Lawrence Shankland.It’s probably a huge worry for a club like United. Of course, all clubs have dferent worries financially because they’re all in dferent situations.The least they deserve is clarity.Even in the summer it doesn’t take long for players to be itching to get back to football.The current situation with the coronavirus shutdown is a dferent kettle of fish entirely, though, and poses heightened mental health risks.For that reason, I was delighted to hear Tony Asghar say Dundee United are using a sport psychologist to help players stay positive.Clubs are far more equipped to deal with these things than when I started  years ago.My son Jack and I have been out on our bikes to try to break the boredom of lockdown this week.He’s been doing a lot of running as part of his training programme from Dundee but somehow I think I’ll stick to the pedals!"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/5e43c7674cc1a8.50317842-795x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street dundee boss james mcpake on his life in football","story":"This week Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger and George Cran are joined by Dundee manager James McPake to talk through his career on the pitch and le since taking up the Dens Park hotseat.The coronavirus lockdown means we are working from home, over the internet, to produce Twa Teams, One Street at present.We hope to continue to bring you podcasts in this uncertain period, eventhey#re with a slightly dferent flavour.Thank you for listening and call the Twa Teams, One Street fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about anything Dundee, United or from the wider world of football.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/HEALTH-Coronavirus-Scotland-17051650-847x564.jpg ","title":"the queen to address the uk as 4450 people test positive for coronavirus in past 24 hours","story":"There are now  people in Scotland who have died from coronavirus, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed # up from  confirmed deaths yesterday.The further  deaths come a day after  people were confirmed to have died from Covid-, with the number people in Scotland who have tested positive for the illness now at ,.In Tayside, there are  people confirmed to have the virus, up from  yesterday.Questions were also raised over claims in a patient in Tayside was #pushed into signing a #do not resuscitate# order#.Ms Sturgeon said that #not just in these circumstances, but in any circumstances should anyone be pushed into signing up to anything like that#.Dr Cathering Calderwood, Scotland#s Chief Medical Officer, said there was no protocol, national or otherwise, for pushing people into signing any #do not resuscitate# order .In neighbouring health board Fe, cases of Covid- have risen from  to .Ms Sturgeon also confirmed that there are , patients currently in hospital in Scotland who have been diagnosed with the virus, of whom  are in intensive care.As the pandemic worsens, Nicola Sturgeon said she hoped Scotland would be testing up to , people a day # saying the target was #broadly similar# to the UK Government Health Secretary Matt Hancock#s pledge to test , people daily by the end of April.Ms Sturgeon said: #We are increasing NHS Scotland#s current capacity of , tests per day up to , per day by the end of this month at the latest.#The first minister also said there are , people north of the border considered #high risk#Dr Calderwood, has sent , letters to people in the #high risk# groups, with the other , to be sent out shortly.More than , people in the high-risk category have already signed up to a text message service, Dr Calderwood said.The service, which started this morning, offers support including access to home deliveries to help those in self-isolation.Meanwhile, the death toll across the UK rose by a worrying  in the past  hours, with , people in the UK now confirmed to have died from the illness.The number of those tested and confirmed to have the virus in the United Kingdom has also jumped to , # up , from yesterday#s total of ,.Meanwhile, The Queen has recorded a special address to the nation to discuss the pandemic, which will broadcast on Sunday.A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “On Sunday April  at pm Her Majesty The Queen will address the UK and the Commonwealth in a televised broadcast.“As well as on television and radio, The Queen’s address will be shown on The @RoyalFamily’s social media channels.”The Queen#s eldest son and heir to the throne, Prince Charles, contracted the virus and was looked after at the Balmoral Estate in Aberdeenshire, where he suffered #mild# symptoms .mdash Clarence HouseApril , In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

This role is the most natural thing in the world for me.”Lisa’s first job will be to help guide the charity through the Covid- outbreak and make sure those in need can access enough food and essential items to live.Cfine has partnered up with Aberdeen Foyer, Aberdeen Cyrenians and Social Bite to support people struggling in the north-east.Supported by the Evening Express and Original FM, the aim is to get as much essentials delivered as possible each day.Lisa highlighted how pleasing it was to see so many third sector organisations work in partnership to become a “leline” to the residents of the north-east.She said: “I have started the role in what is a critical time for everyone in the north-east.“Immediately we are aiming to get food together for the most vulnerable people in society and it is brilliant to see the staff and volunteers here roll up their sleeves and get stuck in as the demand for our services increases.“More people are finding themselves in need and we have responded to that well.“My aim is to ensure Cfine is robust and financially sound, and that we continue on with our strong ethos and continue to provide food and services to our beneficiaries.“We are an absolute leline for some people and it is good for them to know we are out there helping them.”However, in order for Cfine and their partner organisations to continue to help those in need, they need donations, whether it be food or financial help.Lisa added: “Across the partnership, there are three strands of support needed. We had a drive for volunteers which we got a fantastic response to, and although there is no current need for them, this could change in the near future, so you can still get in touch.“Our food drives have signicantly slowed down so more donations would be good.“However, it may be easier to make financial donations due to the lesser need for contact and they would be well-received and put to good use.”You can donate to Cfine through its website: cfine.org vw, px\"  Applications can be made through www.ACU.org or    "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/20200405_151021-scaled-e1586198891778-615x564.jpg ","title":"tributes to much loved aberdeen great grandfather who was true gentleman","story":"Tributes have been paid to a much-loved great-grandfather who remained a “true gentleman” throughout a battle with dementia.John Maitland, who grew up in the Hilton and Midstocket areas of Aberdeen, passed away on Wednesday with a chest infection at the age of .The grandfather of four and great-grandfather of one was a keen caravanning enthusiast and was also heavily involved in the church and Boys’ Brigade, initially with Bon Accord Church and then moving when that closed to Denburn Church.Mary, John’s we, , described her late husband as “super”, adding: “He was a very good, God-fearing man.“He was quiet but he had a good sense of humour – a wicked sense of humour sometimes.“He was very keen on his Boys’ Brigade and his church and he worked hard for that.“He loved his caravanning, and he loved his family.”Married for  years, they met at Bon Accord Church youth fellowship. vw, px\"  Mary sang with the church choir.She said: “I think we were meant for each other.”The couple have a son and daughter, Jane Dargie and Douglas.

Seventy-two people are now in intensive care after testing positive for the disease.Speaking at a briefing at St Andrew’s House in Edinburgh, Dr Calderwood said most of the people who have contracted the virus in Scotland are either unaware they have it or have been self-isolating after suffering symptoms.“There will come a time that I will be able to talk to you about the numbers being infected and that rate slowing, but that time is not yet and that time will not be for some weeks to come”, she said.“I was quoted yesterday in some of the press as estimating there were somewhere between , and , people in Scotland with coronavirus.“While it is dangerous to go day-by-day I want to really emphasis that I would now be estimating that there are more than , people in Scotland infected.“The importance there is that only a  have been confirmed.

The most important thing all of us can do is to follow the advice and stay at home wherever possible.”Dr Calderwood also said Thursday night’s Clap for Carers, which she took part in, was the first time she had cracked a smile “for quite some time”, adding: “I am very proud to be part of the NHS.“My NHS colleagues really appreciate it.

Netzer had just won the European Championships with West Germany and would win the World Cup in .Netzer was described as “the best passer of a football there has been” by none other than Dutch great Johan Cruyff.He ran the show as the visitors, - up by half-time of the first leg, looked set to run away with things. Fortunately, he picked up a thigh injury and was replaced for the second half, allowing Harper and Drew Jarvie to make it - before Monchengladbach scored a third.Harper, who says it was like Netzer was playing a dferent sport to the other  players on the Pittodrie pitch, said: #The best non-British footballer I came up against was without question Borussia Monchengladbach’s Gunter Netzer when we lost to them in the first round of the Uefa Cup in .##It was like he was playing a violin and everyone  a ukelele.#It#s not the first time Harper has spoken about his admiration for Netzer, who won the league with Monchengladbach, as well as La Liga with Real Madrid, before going on to lead Hamburg to the European Cup as general manager, with the Reds most potent hitman of all time previously saying: “His reputation as one of the best players in the world was deserved.“Netzer was a huge man but had amazing finesse when he was on the ball.“He ran us ragged in the first half at Pittodrie and the pass he played to help them go - up was among the best I’ve ever seen.“We almost broke out the champagne when we heard he had suffered a thigh strain and would be unable to come out for the second half.“But it was a delight to have seen such a great player performing at his peak.”Although he may not have realised it at the time, on reflection, Harper says the other greatest player he saw perform in the flesh visited with Manchester United for a friendly on October , . The player was George Best.Aberdeen, without defender Martin Buchan # who was by then in the Red Devils# ranks, won - with Harper scoring twice. However, despite a quiet first period from Northern Irishman Best, the Dons legend knows he was lucky to see the mercurial, troubled Best perform before his personal struggles really took hold.Harper said: #I never realised just how good Best was when I played against him in a friendly at Pittodrie in .#My old captain Martin Buchan had of course moved to Manchester United by that point. We beat United - and I scored twice.#Looking back – you saw Best’s skill, but you didn’t appreciate it as much because you were focused on your own game.#I shared a pitch with a lot of great British players – Arthur Graham, Kenny Dalglish, Billy Bremner and Bobby Moore, but Best was not only a fantastic player, he was also an exciting player.#What made Best so special Harper added: #Best’s directness was sensational. He’d go straight forward and take players on. He’d sometimes turn back on himself, but not to play a pass backwards, to beat the man for a second time.#He had a great knack of dipping the left shoulder and going right, dipping the right shoulder and going left, feinting crosses.#"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 31 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEver since it was #temporarily# closed to new admissions around two years ago, there has been the suspicion that plans were afoot to close Knapdale Ward completely.The HSCP claims to have consulted widely on the future of the ward, yet patients# relatives, front-line nurses and medical professionals say they were never asked for their views.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"a83 slip recovery work ongoing","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEssential work to make safe the area of hillside that slipped and blocked the A earlier this yearis forging ahead.Taking care to maintain social distancing and to observe all current NHS and government health advice, a team of experts has been carrying out extensive operations to stabilise the slope and construct a back-up catch-pit.Led by Forestry and Land Scotland, the team includes the geotechnical engineers and consultants involved in resilience works where on the Rest and Be Thankful, and partners Transport Scotland and BEAR.FLS Planning Manager, John Hair, said: #We’re channelling a lot of resources into this and are working on it seven days a week to make this area safe.#Over , tonnes of debris landed on the road back in January. It took a lot of clearing up but that loss of material from the hillside presented other problems as well. We’re currently underpinning a -metre stretch of the forest road to strengthen it and prevent any further major collapse.#The landslip channel has been stabilised but, in the event of future extreme weather events potentially affecting this part of the slope, we are constructing a catch pit that aims to prevent debris from reaching the road surface.#Traffic management will be in place for approximately a further two weeks to allow us to complete the catch pit. We will be working on stabilising the forest road for another four weeks after that but will not require any more traffic management.#Currently only one lane of the carriageway is in use.The area of hillside affected is land that FLS looks after but is well away both from those areas that have slipped in the past and from areas where previous mitigation work has been carried out.Engineering assessments indicate that the incident was the result of exceptionally heavy rain causing a section of hillside above the forest road to slump and block a drainage culvert. This resulted in water damming up, overflowing the forest road and reaching the downhill slope, carrying surface material downhill and also creating a channel for more water to travel down at a faster rate.John, added: #This event arose from a very particular set of circumstances that are unlikely to apply to other sites and situations. However, aware as we are of the increasing occurrence of prolonged spells of heavy rain, we have already reviewed and adapted our inspection process to include checks on other forest roads set in similar landscapes.#We are also developing climate change adaptation actions to make the forests and land more resilient and mitigate such risks.#"},{"url":null,"title":"ferry services cant stay afloat forever msp","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFerry operators are facing #signicant losses,# but cannot stay afloat forever without help, the country#s transport secretary has warned.Michael Matheson MSP has added his signature today to a letter from the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments warning that some routes could sink unless there is intervention.It has been sent to UK Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps to sound the alarm bell over the future of services in places like the Western Isles.Ferry companies have faced signicant losses since the outbreak of COVID- and the crackdown on travel, restrictions on movements and some freight.Politicians are warning that ferry companies will need to make #decisions# on #loss-making routes# in coming days as carrying on with reduced passengers and staffing numbers may not be sustainable longer term.It comes as CalMac, which offers  vessels serving  routes, has revealed its passenger numbers have dropped by  per cent since new rules on essential ferry travel were put in place.The company has carried just , passengers compared to , for the same period last year, although company MD Robbie Drummond welcomed the fact the public is paying attention to government advice not to travel.The company, he said, remained committed to running #leline services# to the islands.Some of the asks of the UK government include an #immediate and temporary# relaxation of the competition regulations and a confirmation that seafaring companies will qualy for the employee support scheme.Mr Matheson said: #My officials and I have kept in touch with ports and ferry operators over the past few weeks and they have expressed substantial concerns with their operations over this dficult period.#I believe that without further intervention operators will need to take dficult commercial decisions which could be avoided, and that it will be extremely dficult to recover from that after we make it through this crisis.#Current reductions in freight traffic are also a serious issue in their own right.#There is a strong case for the UK Government to do more to support this vital sector during these unprecedented times and I look forward to their response on this important matter.#"},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

then feeling isolated.We were very conscious of not going anywhere busy, and the need to avoid close proximity for ourselves as well. It was so strange not being able to give each other a hug, as we have always done over the past  years of our friendship.I chose a walk in which I hoped we would meet nobody , and we walked two metres apart. Despite our plan not to talk about the virus, we inevitably ended up doing just that, although not all the time.The walk took us to the site of the old Byres Kirk, just beyond Ormiston. As hoped, it was deserted, and so we entered.The eeriness of current events affected my behaviour. I walked around with my friend, carefully ensuring I touched nothing. The original kirk built here in  is long gone. It replaced an even older kirk, the remains of which are hidden in private woodland next to nearby Ormiston Hall not far from this site.The first kirk at Byres was eventually demolished and replaced by a neo-gothic building in the s. But after the opening of a new church in Ormiston in the s, Byres Kirk was finally abandoned and eventually demolished in the s.But the graves remain, including war graves, and there is also a headstone erected by Isabella Burns, sister of the famous poet, to the memory of her children.It was this headstone I had come to see. Isabella was the youngest sister of Robert Burns and she lived in Ormiston and Tranent for a while. In  she was widowed, with nine children, three girls and six boys. She set up a village school to help make ends meet.Itrsquos dficult to imagine what her le must have been like, but I think the fact she was part of Robert Burnsrsquo immediate family may have given her a status and a degree of respect most women were denied.I found the stone and was intrigued by it. Two of Isabellarsquos children are mentioned one of them, Edward, died at the age of  in China.ldquoChina  I said out loud to myself, wondering what he was doing there. I saw the date of his death: November , .Then it dawned on me: the Opium Wars! He must have been a soldier. I quickly Googled it on my phone and sure enough he was serving in a regiment there.I stood for a moment, thinking about the story behind this scant piece of information. The Opium Wars are not usually a prominent part of our history curriculum, although they should be. The British state went to war with China to safeguard the ability of British traders to sell opium to the Chinese, which resulted in  million addicts there. Itrsquos a dark part of our imperial history, and the fact that a nephew of Robert Burns ended up dead in China defending state-sponsored drug smuggling by Britain seemed horribly ironic and sad. But it also gave me a sense of the connectedness we all have. The decisions people make, especially those in power, affect the lives of others in ways we will never know or predict.The memorial headstone also had a later inscription which recorded the death of Isabella herself. She lived until she was  and died in . She isnrsquot buried in this graveyard, however, as she spent the last years of her le in Ayrshire and was laid to rest in Alloway Kirkyard.Such a web of le and connection, now mostly long forgotten, revealed by this one memorial stone.As I left, I noticed the trees: oak, sycamore, beech and yew. They seemed to grow out of lost human memory, asthey were now s of forgotten stories.On ourjourney to the car, we passed another memorial stone, this time to the Polish soldiers who had been based in Ormiston Hall in the s during the war. This too is now a time of memory fading, but not forgotten, as the flowers someone left revealed.We had succeeded in a walk seeing almost nobody, except a passing cyclist at the end. Next time we go on such a walk, spring will have arrived undisturbed by human footprints.

support developers are already seeing applications for public meetings lodged without a date or venue for exhibiting future proposals.And Tony Thomas, director of APT Planning  Development in East Linton, says ensuring the building industry is ready to resume as soon as possible may mean future consultations have to be carried out on websites.Mr Thomas revealed that one consultation had already begun online as Queensberry Properties launched a website inviting feedback on its proposals for Finance House in Edinburgh.The website was launched after a planned second public consultation this month had to be cancelled and gives people a chance to view the plans to turn the former office building into residential accommodation with associated commercial and leisure facilities.And it could be the way people are consulted in the future as more companies look at ways to engage with the public without face-to-face gatherings.The first public stage of planning applications for large developments is lodging a pre-application noticewith a council informing them that public consultation meetings are being held.The meetings, which usually take place in town halls or community centres, give local residents a chance to see the proposals for the first time, talk to developers and give their views.However, that crucial stage is on hold for some developments after the lockdown, which prohibits gatherings of more than two people.At Millerhill, Midlothian, a pre-application notice for housing at Wellington Farm on land known as Dukersquos Field has been lodged with no date or venue for the public exhibition.In a note to the council, the developers have said: ldquoIn light of Governmentadvice which seeks to minimise the spread of coronavirus, non-essential contact is limited at his time.ldquoWe are therefore awaiting the advice of the Scottish Government before making any formal arrangements for pre-application public engagement.Mr Thomas said it was vital for the

hard to continue lsquoas normalrsquo whilst working remotely and this is hugely appreciated.ldquoIt will be important that as and when restrictions are lted the development industry is ready to respond quickly.ldquoFrom a workload perspective, most clients are looking to progress with projects that are already in the pipeline and to be fair the alternative would be catastrophic for a sector

Almost nobody has been untouched by it, although for some it has been more cataclysmic than others. But we are in this together, and it will be together that we pull through it.One of the real heartbreaking consequences of the lockdown has been the separation of families. Many grandparents now cannot see their grandchildren, or even their own children. Family of people who are ill cannot visit their loved ones. Each story has its own set of circumstances and sadly more is to come before it gets better.While we do need light-heartedness at this time, itrsquos also really important to acknowledge peoplersquos struggles. It was with gut-wrenching despair I realised a number of weeks ago that the arrival of Covid- in Europe was going to seriously affect so many families, my own included.I have five children, but my middle child, who is now  years old, has for the last eight years shared time between Scotland and Sweden.She went to school here until she was seven, when she began to attend school in Sweden. It was then that I had to adjust to the painful reality of less time with her, although I was still able to maintain regular time with her in Scotland and of course keep in daily touch.Itrsquos been an emotional rollercoaster, in which I have stories of me sleeping at airports, travelling through Scandinavian landscape at ungodly hours, and along the way meeting people who have helped and made a real dference. But itrsquos been worth it as it meant our blended family remained connected and my daughter hasnrsquot felt ided between two families but rather a full part of both.We were due to travel to Sweden this Friday andlater, but of course the flights were cancelled a couple of weeks ago. Explaining this to my daughter, and then not being able to say when we would be together was heartbreaking. I felt so helpless, unable to comfort her. Wersquod all counted down the days and now it seems it may be weeks, even months, before any reunion will be possible.I know that there will be families in similar or worse situations. My heart goes out to them all. My initial response to my situation was to close down with despair. The idea of not being with my child, for whom I was the equal main carer until recently, feels unbearable. Some friends have said, with good intentions: ldquoAt least shersquos safe.Yes she is, and I give thanks for that. But any loving parent facing long-term enforced separation from their child will understand the grief that such separation creates. It seeps into your being and makes it dficult to get through the day without having really dark moments. I tried to hide my emotions, but my loving and understanding we knows me too well yet she too felt helpless.There are moments in our lives when we are just overwhelmed by the impossibility of a situation and we just want to curl up and close down. I recently reached that point.Then my daughter asked me while we were talking online: ldquoI wish we could get a magic flying carpet or something dad, or ask the faeries to make a portal. She understood this wasnrsquot possible, but it was the wake-up call I needed. It made me realise I needed to get out of the pit of despair and, for her sake as well as mine, use my creativity to make that magic carpet, and that portal, to help us stay closely connected during this awful time.And the magic ingredient is stories. My daughter has always loved stories, and we have made many up together some of them have even been printed on this page. Now these stories help keep us connected and ease the pain of separation for us both.And so, with the help of technology, and, crucially, a good relationship with her mother, stories have begun to create a vital space for my daughter to be with her Scottish family, even when separated. We can all be together, even my grown-up daughters, who I miss even though they are isolating close by.We storytell to each other, make stories up and even share them in short films. Wee sister Skye, who is six and misses her sister like crazy, holds the tablet which she uses to speak to her, so they can be together while I tell stories and share riddles. We draw and add to the stories together, make fun dramas in which we film ourselves on phones acting out stories like Cinderella, and I have learnt to put wee films together which we can then watch together.Sharing stories like this has given extra meaning to our online communication. It takes us away from just asking ldquohow was your day  or ldquowhat did you do today  questions that often just seem to emphasise our current disconnection. Later, after this crisis is over, the wee films, the artwork and written stories will be memorabilia of this time our evidence that we remained close, even when forced apart.I write about this because I know there are parents and children out there in similarly dficult situations to say you are not alone in this and letrsquos be kind to each other and share the ways we keep ourselves connected. I also know others will have discovered better solutions, as Irsquom no technical wizard.Children are resilient, often more than their grown-ups are, but we need to help them manage this time emotionally, and when we canrsquot give them a hug or be physically with them in hard times, an inheritance of stories they can access can be a real support.I have often been less than enthusiastic about social media in the past, but right now people are discovering in this crisis it has become a leline in many ways.If you, or someone you know, are in a similar situation, please do get in touch. Letrsquos share our experiences, and understand that while we may be isolating, we are not alone."},{"url":null,"title":"european-stone-stacking-championships-dunbar-postponed","story":"The European Stone Stacking Championships were due to take place between April  and , with a place at the World Rock Stacking Championships in Texas next year up for grabs.However, James Craig Page, creator and director of the festival, broke the news that the event, like dozens of others across the county, had to be postponed amid concerns surrounding coronavirus.Mr Page said: ldquoIt has been postponed but we are very hopeful that we will find another venue or be able to go ahead at a dferent time.ldquoHowever, for the time being we have to postpone.This year would have marked the fth year a stone stacking event had taken place in Dunbar event.Each year, it attracts thousands of people to the area, as well as competitors from throughout Europe.Mr Page spoke to the Courier upon ing from the World Rock Stacking Championships in the USA last month.Initially, he was keen to see the European event, which takes place at Eye Cave Beach, off Bayswell Road, take place.However, upon ing to British shores, he became aware of the state of the global issue.Speaking to the Courier, he said: ldquoWe were just waiting for word and advice but it became apparent when I got back how bad things were and that we needed to put it on hold.ldquoWe donrsquot want to be taking any risks with anybodyrsquos health and wellbeing.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music.

When we first trawled the area in search of a home, the number of towers and turrets dotted among the hills or peeking from treetops was immediately apparent. They werenrsquot clustered, as in San Gimignano, but inch for inch they matched those on Tuscanyrsquos peaks.Itrsquos a reminder, were it needed, that murderous feuds were once a universal problem, not something dreamt up by Mediterranean dynasties or Scottish thugs. But the Borders saw more than its fair share of violence, and few parts of the country were as heavily fortied in the Middle Ages. While many of these strongholds now lie in ruins, their presence injects an undercurrent of menace to an otherwise idyllic scene.These past few days I have been thirled to my desk, writing about Mary Queen of Scots, who was frequently in these parts. Sometimes she was going about royal business ndash presiding over law courts in Jedburgh for instance ndash but often she was socialising, as when she was one of a hunting party at Traquair. Whatever their purpose, few of her visits passed without drama of some sort. On one particularly memorable occasion she was seeking refuge. In such times, the castles and keeps for which the region is famous, came into their own.The room where I work looks out on to the village green, where no car has passed this last hour, nor anybody walked by the window. The silence is thick. Even wildle seems to be on tiptoe. It is days since wersquove heard a plane, and the initial stream of brightly clad walkers and cyclists from nearby towns escaping the lockdown has long since dried up.With little  to do but get on with the next chapter in Maryrsquos story, I am struck by the irony that in bygone centuries people often went into self-isolation not just willingly but eagerly. Keeping people at a distance was sometimes essential to save your skin. No government edict was required to make these escapees haul up the portcullis or bar the gate. In fact, especially around here, it could be the governors of the day from whom they were retreating.When pestilence swept through communities, those who could afford to flee towns and cities for the countryside did so, for as many weeks as it took. No doubt the fortied dwellings around here came in useful in those circumstances, but itrsquos not what they were built for. Disease could pass through a portcullis or a keyhole, butthe place was well enough constructed, mortal enemies intent on tearing you limb from limb could not.The lordrsquos tower where villagers from Hoolet could run for safety leaves only a trace today. Even when it was a landmark, it was so far off thatdanger had been at the door not even Usain Bolt would have reached it in time. No doubt when danger loomed lookouts would have been posted on the hills, beacons and torches spreading warnings fast. But while living in fear of sudden deadly attack sounds scary, was it any more alarming than the microscopic foe we currently face  Will far-distant historians look back at  and wonder how we coped  For that matter, will we Long before the present emergency, when isolation is an inflexible order rather than a whimsical choice, Irsquove always secretly wanted to live in a fortied keep. Smailholm Tower is my ideal. The thought of looking down from upstairs to see who is knocking on the studded door greatly appeals. A friend who lives in a th-century house in Italy always unlatches the kitchen window, on the first floor, and calls out ldquoFriend or foe  when we arrive. There are no windows at ground level.Borders keeps donrsquot have the space or allure of castles ndash I canrsquot see a series called Escape to the Peel Tower ndash but they are brilliantly designed for splendid isolation. Admittedly those with mobility problems or serious underlying health issues might have trouble reaching the bathroom under the rafters. Nor are they for the very tall, who risk concussionthey sit up suddenly in bed.Generally therersquos one room on each level, and the stairs from cellar to rooftop are a vigorous workout. Just bringing lunch from kitchen to dining table burns calories. The turnpike stair between floors is wide enough for one person only, presumably so you could single-handedly fight off anyone who got inside, skewering them inidually as they appeared. The walls are thick enough to withstand fires intended to smoke you out, the windows too small for any but a sniperrsquos aim, and the parapets heaven-sent for tipping boiling water or tar on to those below. Cannon balls could do fearful damage and eventually bring the household out waving white flags, but that would take time. The most pressing worry for anyone besieged in a keep was lack of ale and hunger. In that respect things arenrsquot so dferent for us.Fleeing from her rebellious lords in June,  Mary Stuart escaped to Borthwick Castle with her disreputable Borderer husband the Earl of Bothwell. Shortly after, the army of those who wanted to depose her set up camp outside. Bothwell managed to nip out the back door, leaving the queen to rail at her besiegers from the battlements. Apparently her language was so foul the ambassador who reported the scene quickly redacted it.Borthwick is built to withstand siege for months on end, but one night Mary was lowered out of a window on to a horse, and rode through the dark to Dunbar. The castle there was all but impregnable. Arguably the biggest mistake she ever made, some days later, was to leave this safe haven. Anyone searching for parallels between those days and ours need look no further."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-age-lockdown-scotland-needs-new-kind-freedom","story":"As it happens, there are upsides to the restrictions: as long as wersquore all stuck in the house, there canrsquot be any more marches for Scottish independence, so we do have that to be thankful for. The lockdown has also spared us some of the less subtle attempts to publicly celebrate the declarationrsquos anniversary. There are some Scottish nationalists who love to quote its famous phrase about oppression, or lordship, by the English asthat is still somehow relevant today. It isnrsquot.So what relevance does the Declaration of Arbroath actually have then  Over the last couple of weeks, Irsquove been trying to answer that question by speaking to historians, writers and commentatorsand a few things have struck me. First, some people still arenrsquot able to put the talk of oppression by the English in its proper context ndash ie the th century. Second, there is a lot of disagreement about what it says, what it means and where it leads. And third, and most important, there are some ways in which the document is still revealing and relevant in  ndash specically, it can show us how to make the UK better. In the age of the lockdown, it also suggests that Scots need a new kind of freedom.To be clear, I do not mean freedom in the traditional Mel Gibson sense, I mean freedom in the very specic way it applies in the United Kingdom. One of the commentators I spoke to about the declaration was Kevin Hague, whose organisation These Islands encourages positive debate about the constitution, and he put it best when he said this: Scotlandrsquos part in the UK works not because of a -year-old declaration, but because of the lack of a declaration that tries to tie the British constitution or identity down.What Mr Hague meant was very specic: the Scots ndash and the English and everyone  in the UK ndash enjoy the protections and security of a union while also enjoying the freedom, without limit, to express and implement a broad range of identities. ldquoThatrsquos an advert for why the UK works, he told me. ldquoScots havenrsquot been oppressed and subjugated to England itrsquos a union which allowed the separate national identities not just to be maintained but to flourish. Who thinks the Scots arenrsquot Scottish as a result of  years of union Seven hundred years on from the Declaration of Arbroath, this is a critical point. The freedom that the declaration was talking about was freedom from military domination by the English, but the freedom thatrsquos relevant now is the freedom to express ourselves while co-operating in a union of nations. It is not a freedom that the nobles who put their name to the declaration would recognise, but thatrsquos the point. It is a modern freedom that cedes sovereignty rather than takes up arms to protect it. Itrsquos freedom as shield, not sword. Itrsquos pluralism. Itrsquos multi-nationalism.It does raise an obvious question though, which is whether we have enough of this kind of freedom in modern Scotland. Nationalists would obviously say \"no, we want total freedom\" whatever that means, but a lot of unionists would also say we need more freedom within the UK. What they mean by that is a properly federal system based on proportional representation which would give everyone in the UK the freedom to express their views but, more importantly, produce governments that accurately reflect those views.The hope for unionists in this is that by promoting and encouraging such freedoms under a federal system, the desire for a more aggressive nationalistic freedom a la  can be contained. Irsquom not saying this would be the case ndash the theory of many of those who supported devolution in the s was that it would burst the bubble of nationalism and we know what happened to that. But maybe we should listen to the words of former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe when he tried to introduce a federal system in . ldquoTime and again in our constitutional history, he said, ldquowe have conceded in bitterness what should and could have been granted in logic.Hopefully,  years on, logic can still be an answer to bitterness, although we canrsquot avoid the fact that the history of  years ago is still emotionally and politically powerful. But take a look, logically, at the story of those seven centuries. The Scots confidently asserted their identity in  and have done so ever since, within and without the union. The lesson of the centuries is that the British Isles and the UK have always been pluralistic societies with many national identities.Will that history be as powerful as the history of  in deciding the future of Scotland  Irsquom not sure, particularly on this anniversary day. But I think Kevin Haguersquos question is still a good one: who thinks the Scots arenrsquot Scottish as a result of  years of union And maybe we could ponder this question as well:  years on from the blood and guts that produced the Declaration of Arbroath, who would dare to write a new declaration for   The point, surely, is that we do not need one. Wersquore multi-national, wersquore pluralistic, wersquore a country of many identities and ndash no matter how powerful or potent ndash it is not a declaration that sums that up, it is the lack of one."},{"url":null,"title":"catherine-calderwood-obstetrics-expert-held-scotlands-top-medical-job","story":"Her appointment as chief medical officer for Scotland came after more than two decades of work in the health service, including on the investigation into the deaths of mothers and newborn babies at Morecombe Bay.:Coronavirus: CMO Dr Catherine Calderwood resignsBorn in , Dr Calderwood completed her undergraduate studies at Cambridge University, before qualying as a medic from the University of Glasgow in .She worked as a junior doctor in Glasgow Royal Infirmary and the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh before specialising in obstetrics and gynaecology.This knowledge was key to her involvement in helping to reduce stillbirths and neonatal deaths in Scotland since becoming an adviser to the government in .After taking on the role of chief medical officer in , Dr Calderwood, , continued to have a maternity medicine and antenatal clinic at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.:Coronavirus: CMO Catherine Calderwood removed from public-facing roleShe chairs the UK maternal, newborn and infant clinical outcome review programme and the Scottish Government stillbirth working group and is also a member of Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists stillbirth clinical studies group.However, the doctorrsquos position as chief medical officer was considered untenable after she was photographed at her second home, in contravention of coronavirus lockdown rules.Despite apologising after the pictures of her family hear her Fe home appeared in the Sun on Sunday, Dr Calderwood resigned ldquowith a heavy heart.After she stepped down on Sunday evening, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon paid tribute to Dr Calderwood and her ldquotransformational work.She said:ldquoWhile she has made a very serious mistake in her actions, that should not detract from the fact that as CMO she has made a highly valuable contribution to the medical profession and to health in Scotland, and I have no doubt she will continue to do so in future."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11232332.jpg?type=article-full","title":"nicola-sturgeon-defends-judgment-chief-medical-officer-fiasco","story":"The First Minister said she acted in ldquogood faith when she decided that ldquocontinuity of advice from Dr Catherine Calderwood was paramount during the coronavirus crisis.However she admitted the actions of Dr Calderwood, the public face of the Scottish Governmentrsquos stay-at-home campaign, had ultimately sent a ldquoterrible message and she had to go.The First Minister said people were \"entitled to think\" she had also made an error of judgment in not sackingDr Calderwood immediately, instead of waiting hours.She said Dr Calderwoodsdeparture wasarrived atldquoby mutual agreement.Ms Sturgeon said she shared the publicrsquos ldquoanger over Dr Calderwoodrsquos actions.She said it was ldquofar from ideal to lose a chief medical officerduring a pandemic, and that she ldquowas ldquovery sorry the situation had arisen.She said: ldquoShe made a big mistake in how she acted.

Worth holding onto, everyone agrees.:In Calderwood scandal Sturgeon had to prioritise public health over personal excusesI said as much on Twitter, during the  hours between the breaking of the Sun on Sunday story and the resignation of Dr Calderwood as Chief Medical Officer, and again yesterday morning on BBC Radio Scotlandrsquos Good Morning Scotland programme.Admittedly, however, I have had a fair amount of flak from a lot of people whom I both like and respect, and who profoundly dispute my analysis and feel that the First Minister badly mishandled the matter.Furthermore, to be fair, opinions on Nicola Sturgeonrsquos handling of Dr Calderwoodrsquos indiscretion are not entirely aligned to whether the holder of the opinion ticked a Yes box or the No box six years ago, as is depressingly common. On the contrary, I have spoken to, and seen comments from, many nationalists and SNP supporters who agree with unionists that Ms Sturgeon bungled Sunday in its entirety. That matters.They see Dr Calderwoodrsquos actions as having been indefensible, a case of one rule for her and another rule for the little people, and clearly deserving of an immediate sacking. They see Ms Sturgeonrsquos failure to do so as a failure of her leadership, even a case of her keeping a crony in post in defiance of all known political and PR gravity.I understand this viewpoint, and the genuine anger Dr Calderwoodrsquos actions provoked amongst the general public. And, even as someone who despairs at the political culture of calling for resignations, I think that the opposition leadersrsquo call for her to be removed was not unreasonable. In any normal time, theyrsquod be right, and this would be an open-and-shut case.However, I think the knee-jerk ldquoSturgeon screwed up analysis is missing two critical factors. The first is an understanding of how politics and PR work during the fastest-moving news environment we have ever seen. The conventional political and PR gravity to which I referred are not present during coronavirus. There are no rules. Thatrsquos why a government can lock us in our homes and still poll at over %. Thatrsquos why a government can shut down an economy and retain the confidence of most people that it is doing a good job. Thatrsquos why a government can tell people not to see their nearest and dearest and be listened to. There really are no rules.By observing the conventional rules of politics and PR, and immediately sacking Dr Calderwood, Ms Sturgeon would have taken every other option off the table. Instead, the CMOrsquos inclusion in the lunchtime press conference was not so much a vote of confidence as it was a buying of some time to see how the story developed, and to ascertain whether the CMO could be saved.This may not have made for a pleasant few hours on social media, but I would contend that it was a good few hours of leadership .\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Scotlands chief medical officer resigns for not adhering to social distancing advice\",\"description\": \"Scotlands chief medical officer resigns for not adhering to social distancing advice\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media efihlhu poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests efihlhu.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Ms Sturgeon has plenty of political capital, and her team will rightly have judged that her personal handling of this is likely to be a -hour lsquobubble storyrsquo. We are enduring, or enjoyingyou prefer, an unprecedented volume and scale of news.Criticism of Ms Sturgeonrsquos management of the matter has PR competition with the Queen making an extremely rare address to the country, the UK Government Health Secretary suggesting that outdoor exercise might be banned, the election of a new leader of the Opposition, and the Prime Minister being admitted to hospital with the virus.In other words, she could afford to take a hitthere was even a scintilla of a chance of keeping Dr Calderwood in post. Because good people are worth holding on to.This first factor is connected to the second factor, that whilst Nicola Sturgeon the politician will have seen the attractiveness of a decisive sacking, Nicola Sturgeon the First Minister will have wanted to hold on to her coronavirus CMO by any means necessary.Dr Calderwood is very well respected amongst the medical profession. In a former le I was employed in that world, and I know from those to whom I have spoken that they consider her medical leadership to have been invaluable in preparing for the looming peak in cases. They genuinely worry about doing this without her, and they question whether her shoes can be adequately filled.And I suspect that, just as Professor Chris Whitty has become a crutch for Boris Johnson, Dr Calderwood will have become one for Ms Sturgeon. She is in the middle of a once-in-a-century crisis and sitting next to her at all times is someone who understands how to manage it. Irsquod argue that, far from being a failure of leadership not to sack her, it would have been a failure of leadership not to do everything possible to keep her.This has been a sorry episode for everyone. It is a problem for everyone reading this column, because it is at least a distraction from the fight against coronavirus, and at worst a setback against it.But it is perhaps also a lesson. A select group of doctors and scientists across the UK have effectively been co-opted by governments. They are now, to every degree, under the same scrutiny as politicians.What we have seen exposed, in a brutal  hours, is that the ldquodo as I say, not as I do approach which often characterises the medical profession can work in a clinical setting, but leads to disaster in a political one.Andy Maciver is Director of Message MattersShops across Scotland are closing.

In the process, she has completely undermined those rules, which she must know herself.I can understand Nicola Sturgeonrsquos desire to stay loyal to someone she has worked closely with, but Dr Calderwoodrsquos behaviour was gross misconduct and it should have been immediately obvious to Ms Sturgeon and her advisers that the CMOrsquos position was untenable.Doug Maughan, Dunblane.THERE is no doubt Dr Calderwood had to resign, and should have gone within minutes, in spite of the excellence of her advice in this time of pandemic. Indeed, it was because she flouted her own advice.It doesnrsquot matter than Price Charles had done something arguably worse, travelling hundreds of miles with his personal security staff when exhibiting signs of a contagious virus. It doesnrsquot matter that the Prime Minister and his Covid- team had ignored the social distancing advice and contaminated each other: at one point the Prime Minister even insisting on shaking hands with all and sundry.It doesnrsquot matter that the same newspapers who jumped on the Chief Medical Officer, had the week previously attacked the police in England for trying to enforce that same travel ban, in that instance to the Peak District and other National Parks in England. No, all that matters is that Dr Calderwood had to go, a sad loss during a crisis, but what sticks in the craw is the unholy, slavering glee from a highly partisan media and Unionist politicians that they had, at long last ldquogot a scalp.GR Weir, Ochiltree.IN the justiable uproar over the resignation of the disgraced Catherine Calderwood, an extremely important isssue is in danger of being missed.By the time Nicola Sturgeon gave her disastrous press conference on Sunday, she knew that Dr Calderwood had been in Fe on at least two weekends when she should have been in Edinburgh. If we take the First Minister at her word that she had not known of the Chief Medical Officers whereabouts until that daythen she is admitting that she had lost operational control.Had the CMOs advice ndash which was cited as being so irreplaceably invaluable at the same press conference ndash was required, at short notice, she was over an hours drive away. The question is: why did the First Minster not know the whereabouts of her Chief Medical Officer at the time of a deadly pandemic Peter A Russell, Glasgow .THE Calderwood debacle raises the question of what has been the point of having a separate Scottish team giving its own daily briefings during this crisis. The answer is that it allows Ms Sturgeon her time in the limelight, and she is very much the star of the show.

My understanding is that the dangerous and unhygienic conditions in a so-called \"wet market\" in China are where the virus started spreading from. I have seen no apology from the Chinese government about this, or reassurances that conditions over food hygiene have been improved, such as veterinary inspections, as would be the case in slaughterhouses in developed nations.When the crisis is over I would expect governments to raise the possibility of financial reparations for the countries worst affected.

His experience of winning in Scotland and his understanding of the constitution will be vital for our partyrsquos future, with Holyrood elections just over one year away.ldquoI look forward to uniting our party and working with Ian, Richard and Jackie so that Labour stands up for the interests of the Scottish people, their public services, their well-being and their prosperity.Other familiar faces ed to the partyrsquos top team, including former leader Ed Milliband, who will take up the role of shadow business, energy and industrial secretary, and David Lammy who is covering the justice brief.Sir Keir , who won the leadership contest on Saturday, said the line-up showed the ldquobreadth, depth and talents of the party and presented it as a ldquogender balanced cabinet.There are  women and  men, including seven members from black and minority ethnic backgrounds .It was announced on Sunday that rival leadership contenders Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy would be given leading roles also, as shadow education secretary and shadow foreign secretary respectively.Anneliese Dodds, who won her seat during the  general election was given the Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer position - becoming the first woman ever to hold the role.The MP for Oxford East said it was ldquoa surprise when she received the phone call from the new leader of Opposition and was ldquodelighted to accept her promotion.She said it was a ldquostrange kind of celebration for her and her supporters due to the current coronavirus crisis.Former leader Ed Milliband, who also served as climate and energy secretary under Gordon Brown, wrote on Twitter that he was ldquolooking forward to servinghellip alongside such a talented team.He said everyone must ldquofocus on playing our part to tackle the virus outbreak, adding: ldquoWe cannot go back to business as usual after this crisis.Angela Rayner, who was elected as the deputy leader at the weekend,w as named chair of the Labour party while Emily Thornberry, who ran against Sir Keir in the leadership race, is the new shadow international trade secretary.Last night Ms Rayner paid tribute to departing colleagues, saying: ldquoThank you to all those who have left the front bench for your hard work, which will no doubt continue on the backbenches and in select committees. It was a pleasure to work with you all, and I know that together we will carry on fighting for socialism with the same passion."},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-labour-says-goodbye-corbyn-second-referendum","story":"The first, and most obvious, is that the era of Corbyn is well and truly over. Many of his closest allies are out, including Dawn Butler, Richard Burgon and Ian Lavery. A few remain, for now, in the form of Rebecca Long-Bailey, Cat Smith and Andy McDonald.Second to erasing Corbyn is a message of gender equality and ersity. The party itself has made great noises about the fact that more than halfof the roles in the new shadow cabinet are taken up by women, while  are held by men, and seven members are from a BAME background.Inviting Ed Miliband back into the fold is also a brave, but clever move. Although he has taken a back seat during the Corbyn era, he is undoubtedly an experienced politician, a familiar face and someone voters can at least recognise,not trust. Just donrsquot put him anywhere near a bacon sandwich again and he will do just fine, Irsquom sure.Most importantly for us Scots, however, is the reinstatement of Ian Murray, the partyrsquos only remaining MP after it was decimated in the snap general election before Christmas.The Edinburgh South MP is no wall flower and is sure to hold his own party and his opposition to account. He does not shy away from dficult topics, and will play a key role in how the party, both north and south of the border, crafts its message around constitutional issues.His appointment as shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, prising the role back from Rochdale MP Tony Lloyd, means almost certainly there will be harsh words exchanged about Labourrsquos position on a second independence referendum.In short, Mr Murray and several of his MSP colleagues have made their views clear - Labour should stand against a second referendum and must have a coherent, unequivocal stance on the matter.Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, is more flexible, but his suggestion that the party hold a special conference to discuss its position on IndyRef was almost laughed out the door before it had even been discussed. Leaks to the media were taking place during a meeting of the National Executive Committee in January, claiming Mr Leonard was roundly shut down by the other members, and anyone in support of his view was quickly ridiculed too.An MP for a decade, Mr Murray realises that Labour must regain trust with Scottish votersit is to make a foothold anywhere  in the country.Starmerrsquos statements today appear to reflect this, so we may be seeing much more of the new leader north of the border in the months ahead."},{"url":null,"title":"birds-seen-bating-fish-bread-climate-change-causes-new-behaviours-survive","story":"They include baiting fish with bread, attacking prey with the help of a train and using boats as hunting s. Others have been seen opening packets of sugar on cafe terraces and dropping mussels on to hard rocks to break the shell.The innovative tactics seen by many British birds are being fuelled by loss of habitat through global warming and development, say scientists. And species that learn fresh tricks to cope with more challenging circumstances are less vulnerable to extinction.Study author Dr Simon Ducatez, an evolutionary biologist at McGill University, Montreal, said: ldquoWe long suspected this relationship between innovation and survival must exist, but now we have been able to very it quantitatively.ldquoWe have also been able to very the greater the number of innovationsdescribed for a species, the greater the probability its populations are stable or increasing.His team analysed data on more than , bird species ndash including more than , novel feeding techniques.They span almost six decades, thanks to the tireless observations of birdwatchers across the world.Dr Ducatez said: ldquoSome of these remarkable observations were made in the UK. For instance, great egrets have been seen using a piece of bread or insects as fishing bait.It is believed they got the idea by watching anglers do similar things bythrowing bread into the water, or using maggots or worms on their hooks to tempt fish.Dr Ducatez said: ldquoA peregrine falcon even used a train to attack birds as they were flushed by its passage through the forest. Another was observed using fishing vessels as a  for huntingpetrels at sea, a food source otherwise unavailable.The peregrine falcon is the worldrsquos fastest animal, capable of e bombing at more than mph.Dr Ducatez said: ldquoGreat cormorants have been watched timing their fishing strategy with the movement of commercial ferries at a wharf. They use the strong currents generated by the propellers to catch confused fish.All these examples were captured around Britain, but the phenomenon ofaltered avian activity stretches to every country.Dr Ducatez said: ldquoBlue-faced honeyeaters have been observed opening sugar packets on cafe terraces in Australia to then opportunistically take advantage of this new food source.ldquoBullfinches have been seen doing the same in Barbados. Opportunistic carrion crows have also been observed using cars as nut or seashell-crackers.\"Corvids, raptors and gulls are among the most innovative birds. A kelp gull has been seen dropping a mussel to break it on hard rocks in NewZealand. Some birds exhibit problem-solving abilities that rival those of a primate.\"The study published in Nature Ecology and Evolution is the first to show the ability to innovate reduces extinction risk on a global scale.Using a computer model, it also found behavioural plasticity wasspecically effective in combating habitat alteration. Those that more easily incorporate dferent foods into their diets or develop new foraging techniques better withstand environmental changes.Researchers compared the number of observed innovations of each species with their risk of extinction, according to the Red List of the InternationalUnion for Conservation of Nature.Other instances were a great egret killing and eating a common sparrow inBrazil, rather than fish, and a crow stealing scraps from starlings feeding ina dump in Spain. A Himalayan grfon, usually a carrion-eater, was spotted feeding on pine needles in India.Dr Ducatez said: \"Others are complex. Gulls are particularly innovative, including the Pacic gull, that has been seen attempting to prey upon a greater crested tern in Kangaroo Island, South Australia an unusual behaviour for this species.\"But the study found innovation did not protect birds against invasive species or over exploitation. This would explain why some of the most clever animals on the planet such as parrots, whales, and primates are at risk of being wiped out.Co author Dr Daniel Sol, an ecologist at the Autonomous University ofBarcelona, said: \"It must be taken into account the species with the greatest capacity for innovation have longer generation times, which makes them more vulnerable to hunting.\""},{"url":null,"title":"michael-gove-rejects-scottish-government-request-halt-brexit-talks","story":"Mike Russell wrote to Michael Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, requesting a halt to the withdrawal process during the coronavirus pandemic.But the UK Government said it had ldquono intention of changing the December  date for ending the transition period.:Dominic Raab to lead Government as PM battles coronavirus in intensive careMr Russell has now written again to Mr Gove to restate the Scottish Governmentrsquos case.Mr Russell said there will be ldquodismay across Scotland and much of the UK at the Governmentrsquos ldquointention to plough on with their plans for a hard Brexit, or indeed a no-deal Brexit, in less than nine monthsrsquo time.He questioned how the UK Government can be focused on tackling coronavirus while also pursuing Brexit negotiations and said there had been ldquono meaningful discussion of issues with the devolved governments for almost two months, with none likely in the foreseeable future due to the pandemic.He added: ldquoBut, bluntly, is the UK Government now expecting the Scottish Government to ert resources from tackling Covid- to carry out the necessary, extensive work that would be involved ldquoThere is still time to change course ndash and the UK Government should confirm without delay that they will seek the yearrsquos extension that is on offer from June.

There have been concerns around jobs and safety.The organisers of the petition are seeking to halt the plans and are asking for an independent assessment of the decisions and decision-making process around the project to be carried out.A number of MSP#s have stood in opposition to the plans, including Orkney#s Liam McArthur and Shetland#s Beatrice Wishart.Mr McArthur said: “I have been raising concerns about HIAL’s plans to centralise air traffic services for some time now. No-one disputes the need to modernise the way in which these services are delivered, but even HIAL’s own consultants identied the ‘remote tower’ option as the most risky and costly.“The estimated costs of the project appear to fall far short of what will realistically be neededit is to have any chance of being delivered successfully. At the same time, staff have made clear the lack of proper consultation and the intention of many to leave the organisation. If that happens, our leline air services will be at risk of serious disruption.“After the members debate earlier this year, led by my Shetland colleague, Beatrice Wishart, the petition will give parliament a further opportunity to consider this issue. These proposals will have a profound effect on our island communities, so it is right that MSPs, particularly those representing the Highlands and Islands, have the chance to hold HIAL and Scottish Ministers robustly to account”.The petition can be found here.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3061249.jpg--.jpg?1585904999000\n","title":"fed up with dog fouling now you can use a new app to make quick report to council","story":"A new Reportable App for smartphones, which allows people to report dog fouling left on pavements, has been launched by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council.People using the app can send photographs and learn about responsible dog ownership.When callers contact the council to report dog fouling they will be referred to The Reportable App, which can be downloaded from the iPhone App Store or Android Play store.This app allows the reporter to photograph the issue and enter the location and further details including their contact details.This process then allows an officer to follow up where necessary and keep the reporter updated via the app.A Council spokesperson said: This app is just one of the methods we are using to address the issue of dog fouling in Mid and East Antrim.It means that residents can report incidents to us any time of the day, any day in the week at a time that suits them.Its restricted for use of this borough, and is free to download.The new app also gives residents the opportunity to report animal welfare incidents, pollution incidents, high hedges, pests, dog foul, fly tipping or abandoned vehicles.Instructions for downloading and use are on the council website.A how to guide can be found at https:www.midandeastantrim.gov.uk reportable "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3062254.jpg--.jpg?1586164184000\n","title":"food parcels for most vulnerable to go out in coming days council","story":"Food parcels are to be delivered over the coming days to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council residents who are shielding in their homes on medical advice during the Coronavirus Covid- crisis.Families, older citizens and those identied as being most at risk, will also benefit from the initiative, which is being led by the Department for Communities, in conjunction with Health Trusts, local councils, the Voluntary and Community sector and the private sector.The food packages will include items such as tinned goods, dried foods, breakfast cereal and some essential toiletries.Local voluntary and community organisations and council staff will distribute the food packages in adherence to the Public Health Agency health protection guidelines.Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Cllr Maureen Morrow, said: “This is very welcome news for the many people in our local communities who have been urged to shield themselves and protect their own health and wellbeing at this dficult time.“We are seeing first-hand how tough the Coronavirus pandemic is for people from all walks of le and across all age brackets and so this initiative, which Council is helping to deliver in the borough, is a helping hand to the people who need it most.”Communities Minister, Deirdre Hargey MLA, explained: “This vital service will ensure that those most in need in our society who do not have a support network of family and friends to help them through this emergency will have access to basic food supplies.“Not only will it ensure that the most vulnerable do not go without but it will allow those at risk of social isolation to see a friendly face and know that we as a society have not forgotten them.”If you feel you need to avail of the food parcel initiative, or know someone who does, the Freephone COVID- Community Helpline can be accessed by telephone on    email covid@adviceni.net or text ACTION to .The helpline is available  days a week, from am to pm.

Pregnancy itself alters the body’s immune system and response to viral infections in general, which can occasionally be related to more severe symptoms and this will be the same for Covid-.Can a pregnant woman pass coronavirus on to her baby Transmission from mother to baby during the pregnancy or delivery is probable, although the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs, placenta swabs, genital fluid and breastmilk samples from Covid- infected mothers have so far tested negative for the virus. However, a new report describes a case in which the baby born to a Covid- positive mother was found to have antibodies in their blood at birth. This is thought to represent a baby’s response to infection within the womb.Is there a greater chance of miscarriageyou test positive for Covid- There is currently no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or early pregnancy loss in relation to Covid-.Moreover, there is no evidence that the virus damages the baby.

Most women will experience only mild or moderate cold flu like symptoms. Cough, fever, shortness of breath, lack of smell taste and even gastrointestinal symptoms are other relevant presentations.For women who have had symptoms, antenatal appointments can be deferred until  days after the start of symptoms, unless symptomspersevere.For women who are self-isolating because someone in their household has possible symptoms of Covid-, appointments should be deferred for  days.If women develop more severe symptoms or her recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that they are developing a more signicant chest infection that requires enhanced care. In this situation you should contact your maternity care team.Are all antenatal appointments going ahead as normal in Northern Ireland If you are well at the moment and have had no complications in your previous pregnancies arrangements for your care may be altered but they are still important to attend.If you have a routine scan or visit due in the coming days, you will still need to attend but the appointment may change due to staffing requirements. Maternity care is essential to reduce complications in mothers and babies. Even in the context of coronavirus, it is important that pregnant women continue to attend their scheduled routine care when they are well.Pregnant women will be asked to keep the number of people with you to a minimum. This will include being asked to attend maternity appointments alone.There may also be a need to reduce the number of routine antenatal visits.If women have an urgent problem related to the pregnancy but not related to coronavirus, they should get in touch using the same emergency contact details they already have. They should not contact that number unless they have an urgent problem.If women have symptoms of coronavirus, they should contact their maternity service and they will arrange the right place and time for the visits. They should not attend a routine clinic.What risks are there of an expectant mother contracting Covid- on a trip to hospital for an antenatal appointment Maternity care is essential and has been developed over many years with improving success to reduce complications in mothers and babies. The risks of not attending care include harm to mother, her baby or both.Many provisions have been put in place to reduce risk to mothers. These include reducing the number of visits to the hospital to a minimum, advice to mothers on reducing the number of people travelling with mothers to the hospital, attending the appointments alone, keeping numbers reduced in waiting rooms, spacing patients in waiting areas, staff taking additional protective efforts to reduce transmission in clinics with hand washing, cleaning equipment etc.How prepared are hospitals to deal with pregnant women with the virus Very signicant changes have been occurring in hospitals over the past weeks to deal with pregnant women with Covid-. Signicant changes have been made in all areas of the hospital, from clinics to wards and including delivery suites. Practice drills are being run frequently to train staff, additional resources have been brought in to help and a huge effort has been made by all levels of non-clinical, clinical, administrative and management staff.If the mother of a baby has symptoms or tests positive for Covid-, should she isolate herself from the baby Given the current limited evidence, we advise that women and healthy infants, not otherwise requiring neonatal care, are kept together in the immediate post-partum period.A risks benefits discussion with neonatologists and families to inidualise care in babies who may be more susceptible is recommended.Can a new mother with the virus breastfeed The main risk of breastfeeding for infants is the close contact with the mother, who is likely to share infective droplets. In the light of the current evidence, it is advised that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk. Precautions should be taken to reduce spread to the baby such as, hand washing before touching the baby, avoiding coughing or sneezing on the baby while feeding, and considering wearing a face mask,available, while feeding or caring for the baby.Can a pregnant person be accompanied by a partner or have visitors A person in labour can be accompanied by one birthing partner, according to the new guidelines. No visitors are permitted in ante-natal or post-natal ward areas.Will babies continue to be delivered in all Northern Ireland hospitals No, not at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine. Antenatal services will continue but it is not possible to deliver babies in the hospital during this surge period.This is due to a lack skilled paediatricians available to provide emergency care to a baby born in distress throughout the  hour period. To protect the wellbeing of mothers and babies, women booked to deliver in Causeway will be contacted and have their delivery transferred to Antrim or Altnagelvin Hospital.Should parents introduce their newborn to friends and family Current government guidance is that you should not meet with people outside your household, so no family celebrations are permitted at present.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Some  households in north Belfast were delighted when a mystery chocolate-laden benefactor left the confectionery at their doors. However, social distancing during these troubled times meant there could be no hugs or handshakes. After leaving the eggs volunteers from Tamhi, one of Northern Ireland#s biggest mental health charities, rang the doorbells and ran away in traditional #knick knock# style. It was all co-ordinated by Mickey Meehan, one of the charity#s two full-time employees, who took photos and later made a video of acts of kindness. We just decided to use our one allotted hour of exercise per day in a meaningful way, Mickey told the Belfast .We wanted to spread a bit of joy around our local community because there has been so much negativity and stress around coronavirusWe had a little bit of money set aside and then the Co-Op on the Oldpark Road gave us £ so we went to Asda and bought a lot of Easter eggs and we dropped them off at random houses in north Belfast.Mickey said they got tons of feedback from happy householders who found the treats on their doorsteps.People had been feeling asnobody cared about them, he said. But this put a smile on their wee faces. Mickey added: It cost very little to do but hopefully it has made a bit of an impact and helped spread some much-needed positivity around.One of the volunteers dressed up as a Power Ranger and another donned a Batman outfit while doing the rounds. Fortunately the police, who were on patrol in the area, gave the selfless activity their blessing. Can you imagine anything better than being a kid stuck indoors and getting an Easter egg from Batman  Mickey said.The video, which is accompanied by the song Lean On Me by the late Bill Withers, is attracting plenty of attention on social media and features several of the smiling recipients.

put in place an unprecedented package of measures to support the whole of the UK through this challenging time,” he said.“I am pleased we have been able to move quickly to provide five million

enough for me to simply say our stocks are signicant or sufficient for current pressures.“We need to make sure our distribution and deployment to all frontline settings is the best it can be – and that all staff know where to turn within their organisations when they have concerns or questions.“Frontline settings include hospitals, ambulance crews, primary care Covid centres, care homes, domiciliary care workers and other parts of the system where staff are working flat out to care for people.”Newly updated UK-wide NHS PPE guidance has been issued in recent days, providing detailed

Ireland works best when it works together.During recent bad weather spells Met Eireann has left Northern Ireland out of a series of weather warnings posted on their online services, despite similar warnings being in effect.Northern Ireland#s weather warnings are issued by the Met Office, which covers the whole of the UK.Yesterday Mr O Donnghaile welcomed the development - reported by TheJournal.ie - insisting on social media it was important Met Eireann addressed the issue.At this stage warnings are issued by separate meteorological services. However, when warnings are in effect, that should be indicated highlighted in order to maximise info, safety and understanding, he tweeted.Met Eireann did not respond to a request for comment, however, Ms Cusack first proposed displaying Northern Ireland weather warnings via the Met Office last September.Ms Cusack told TheJournal.ie that since she took over the role in March  she has been aiming to incorporate Northern Ireland in Met Eireann#s weather warnings.She explained that the final technical issues are currently being ironed out.The primary reason Met Eireann proposes displaying weather warnings issued by the UK Met Office for Northern Ireland is to ensure the safety of citizens who travel across the border for work or other activities, she explained in a document seen by TheJournal.ie.The core rationale for issuing weather warnings is to protect lives... and to mitigate damage to property and disturbance to economic activity at times of severe weather, she added.Information for Northern Ireland that will appear on Met Eireann weather maps will be directly linked with the UK Met Office.Belfast Most ReadPolice probingLimerick gangsters set up Ardoyne murder of brutal killer Robbie Lawlor QUB professor steps aside from top architectural role over affair claimMan critical and three arrested after Belfast Ardoyne stabbingArmagh men in court after ATM #military operation# robbery in LouthPolice investigating death of man in east Belfast,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Like a B-rated sci-fi movie, our world is being ravaged by a killer virus which will affect tens of thousands, maybe millions. No-one knows. The experts disagree. Politicians do too, though that’s less of a concern. Worst, there is no certainty of a happy ending, with a superhero with special powers and a shiny suit to sort it all out. In a world where for almost all illnesses, we have effective diagnosis and treatment, and international experience and research to guide management, this Covid  lark is beyond our comprehension.We people who are accustomed to a pill for every ill must readjust to a new set of paradigms. googletag.cmd.push The prospect of arbitrary illness and possible death, without the presence of loved ones at the bedside, and for those of faith, the comfort of the sacraments, is terrying. For families, being unable to have the beautul and peculiarly Irish ritual of farewell, a wake and funeral to grieve and offer thanks, compounds the dread. We know that the young and healthy are likely to come through this, and that it is our elderly who are likely to succumb. Many of the sacrices we make are to protect the vulnerable and those who care for them. But there are no guarantees that any of us is safe. googletag.cmd.push Prince and pauper are vulnerable-tho it’s fair to assume that the prince isn’t coping from a homeless shelter or wracked with worry about how the bills will be paid. As with all human endeavour, there is goodness in abundance. People are delivering hot meals from their own resources to the isolated and vulnerable. Supermarket staff are stocking shelves, scanning tins and packets and smiling through the fear. Council staff empty bins, clean the streets and work from home to keep the wheels of this city turning. Bus drivers, mechanics, what we used to call lorry drivers but are now logistics operatives, all are at their posts, so that we can eat and stay healthy. Mammies and daddies, facing their own worries are reassuring their children that all will be well, putting them over their lessons and trying their best to keep them occupied and safe.So many people who have left work are offering their skills and experience to help in whatever way they can. Machinists skilled from years in Derry’s factories are working at home making masks to protect their neighbours. An incredible , people have volunteered to help the beleaguered NHS. A friend confided regarding her own health worries that she wasn’t concerned so much about herself, but about what might happen her mother with dementia, for whom she cares at home. This is love in action. Our postman came this morning, our usual chat done at two metres distance. We still managed to cover our usual repertoire of politics, weather, health and families, while keeping two metres part. My washing machine packed in. Well I think it’s a vital service, so I rang the man, fully expecting him to tell me to get lost. He told me he would look at it, but wanted to work alone, as his son is immunosuppressed. He came in the back door, I left the money in an envelope, and my clothesline now flutters with clean sheets. I feel especially for our young people, the unique, primal, mad impulsive joy of teenage springtime pulsing in their veins with the first sunny days. They are staying indoors, chatting online, putting in the days, making mad memes for the craic and to keep sane. My niece, doing her Leaving, and with no prospect of exams, is still doing a bit of study, and helping her daddy plant spuds.Her school days ended without the rituals of parties and goodbyes. Even our wee Fionnuala, my four year old grandchild, who lives with us and is the light of our lives in these dark days, knows that school is now at the kitchen table, because of the bad germs which and might make people sick. She washes her hands hourly - and the floor and walls - with enthusiasm and great care. Everywhere, people are doing what they must, often at great personal cost, while struggling with their own worries about work, bills and what the future will bring. They do these things cheerfully and in the best way they can. Superheroes don’t always wear fancy costumes, they are all around us. In these surreal times, we see our old certainties and values exposed as worthless. They seem to have been replaced by an older and more tried and tested value system, less about rights, and more about what is right. Let’s hope that these lessons stick when Covid  is a distant memory.

Slaughtneil, Ballinderry and Craigbane have emerged since , before going on to take provincial honours. There has been a new breed coming knocking at the door in recent years in the form of Glen, Lavey and reigning champions Magherafelt. Over the coming weeks, the County Derry Post will select a series of Derry club teams from the last decade. Up first is Michael McMullan, who delved through the ious players on the club scene to select his team of the decade, from  to .  – Antoacutein McMullan  googletag.cmd.push Began his knock-out championship career with a man of the match performance in the  quarter-final against Glenullin. McMullan was forced to successfully change his kick-out strategy when Mickey Moran introduced a more fluid central spine. Was immense in  against Kilcoo and Kilcar as Slaughtneil won a third Ulster title.  – Oisin Duffy  Despite failing to break into the Derry minor team in his final year, Duffy went on to play at senior level for the county. He was the driving force at the heart of Foreglens drive to two intermediate championship titles and their stint in senior football. At home as a marker or initiating attacks from his role at centre back. googletag.cmd.push  – Dermot McBride  McBride was one of the best man markers in the red and white of Derry during the early part of the decade. In his club colours, he carried on this level of consistency and has played anywhere in the back six – helping them to the  county final. He has defied a series of injuries to extend his playing career to this season.  – Karl McKaigue  The Emmets defender has been one of the main reasons behind Slaughtneils watertight unit. In , he held his direct opponent scoreless in all eight games on their way to the Ulster title. He is not just a maker, he is comfortable on the ball and has often been a receiver of short kick-outs to help his side build from the back.  – Brendan Rogers  Made his name as a full-back, but has excelled anytime he gets let loose on the wing. Ballinascreen tried to pull him out in a county final and he went on the rampage – building attacks. He attacked Ballinderrys Ryan Bell last season and when the Emmets were defeated by Glen, Rogers almost reeled them back in.  – Connor Nevin  Won a championship medal in this first season in  and went on to pick up another three, including an Ulster title as captain five years later. Has played everywhere from full-back to midfield. In recent years, when Ballinderry have been away from the top table, he still puts his shoulder to the wheel. A tough, yet quiet, character.  – Chrissy McKaigue  Made his debut while still in the minor grade, McKaigue spent a brief spell with Sydney Swans at the start of the decade, but ed to be spiritual leader of Slaughtneils golden era. He has played at full-back, but is more at home in the centre where he can dictate the terms of the game. Will regularly get forward to chip in with a score.  – Patsy Bradley  Was his debut as a high-fielding wing-back  years ago, but it was only a matter of time before he became Slaughtneils midfield general. Patsy may lack the height of many other midfielders but certainly made up for it with his salmon-like jump and hang time. It was inspirational and he often popped up when Slaughtneil needed him most.  – Niall Holly  Had he not picked up a nasty shoulder injury at the vital conjuncture against Scotstown, two years ago, Coleraine may well have pushed on an picked up an Ulster title. Can play at full-back but a colossus at midfield and his absence from the county team has been a huge void. Tall, mobile and tough. The perfect midfielder.  – Sean Leo McGoldrick  The number on the jersey is irrelevant for Sean Leo, giving his possession game from wing back to wing forward. He has to be every managers dream. Busy, comfortable on the ball and always takes the right option. When Lavey threatened to stage their late comeback in the  final, it was Sean Leo at the heart of their insurance point.  – Enda Muldoon  Made his senior debut as a goalkeeper in the  McGlinchey Cup. The following season, he spearheaded Ballinderrys attack on their way to his first championship. It was the start of a stellar career of arguably the best club player of his generation. A chief scorer, a target for kick-outs and can pass the ball with effortless accuracy.  – Enda Lynn  Some county players fade away in club football. Enda Lynn is not one of them. Despite being kicked from pillar to post, as Greenloughs talisman, he led the Wee Reds from intermediate football to being seconds away from a senior county final. Handles the ball more than most and is potent as an inside forward.  - Raymond Wilkinson  Crook has played in a number of roles for Ballinderry. His two goals sank Kilrea in the  final and he found the net the following year to break Banaghers resolve in the semi-final. He has played both as busy link man in the half-forward line and inside for Shamrocks. He also made a comeback to play in recent years.  – Mark Lynch  Came to prominence as a  year old, in Derrys last All-Ireland minor win. Was always destined for greatness. Played up front for Banagher and led the line to perfection and his six points almost shot them into the county final. Switched to midfield when they won the intermediate title and last season, they were touching distance from the senior decider.  – Conleith Gilligan  Was Derry minors penalty scoring goalkeeper in . Three years later he led Ballinderry to All-Ireland sevens success as the fly keeper, but came to the fore as the playmaker for their All-Ireland club win. In his later years, he reinvented himself as an inside forward, where he carried their scoring mantle until he eventually retired.

Slaughtneil, Ballinderry and Craigbane have emerged since , before going on to take provincial honours. There has been a new breed coming knocking at the door in recent years in the form of Glen, Lavey and reigning champions Magherafelt. Over the coming weeks, the County Derry Post will select a series of Derry club teams from the last decade. Up first is Michael McMullan, who delved through the ious players on the club scene to select his team of the decade, from  to .  – Antoacutein McMullan  googletag.cmd.push Began his knock-out championship career with a man of the match performance in the  quarter-final against Glenullin. McMullan was forced to successfully change his kick-out strategy when Mickey Moran introduced a more fluid central spine. Was immense in  against Kilcoo and Kilcar as Slaughtneil won a third Ulster title.  – Oisin Duffy  Despite failing to break into the Derry minor team in his final year, Duffy went on to play at senior level for the county. He was the driving force at the heart of Foreglens drive to two intermediate championship titles and their stint in senior football. At home as a marker or initiating attacks from his role at centre back. googletag.cmd.push  – Dermot McBride  McBride was one of the best man markers in the red and white of Derry during the early part of the decade. In his club colours, he carried on this level of consistency and has played anywhere in the back six – helping them to the  county final. He has defied a series of injuries to extend his playing career to this season.  – Karl McKaigue  The Emmets defender has been one of the main reasons behind Slaughtneils watertight unit. In , he held his direct opponent scoreless in all eight games on their way to the Ulster title. He is not just a maker, he is comfortable on the ball and has often been a receiver of short kick-outs to help his side build from the back.  – Brendan Rogers  Made his name as a full-back, but has excelled anytime he gets let loose on the wing. Ballinascreen tried to pull him out in a county final and he went on the rampage – building attacks. He attacked Ballinderrys Ryan Bell last season and when the Emmets were defeated by Glen, Rogers almost reeled them back in.  – Connor Nevin  Won a championship medal in this first season in  and went on to pick up another three, including an Ulster title as captain five years later. Has played everywhere from full-back to midfield. In recent years, when Ballinderry have been away from the top table, he still puts his shoulder to the wheel. A tough, yet quiet, character.  – Chrissy McKaigue  Made his debut while still in the minor grade, McKaigue spent a brief spell with Sydney Swans at the start of the decade, but ed to be spiritual leader of Slaughtneils golden era. He has played at full-back, but is more at home in the centre where he can dictate the terms of the game. Will regularly get forward to chip in with a score.  – Patsy Bradley  Was his debut as a high-fielding wing-back  years ago, but it was only a matter of time before he became Slaughtneils midfield general. Patsy may lack the height of many other midfielders but certainly made up for it with his salmon-like jump and hang time. It was inspirational and he often popped up when Slaughtneil needed him most.  – Niall Holly  Had he not picked up a nasty shoulder injury at the vital conjuncture against Scotstown, two years ago, Coleraine may well have pushed on an picked up an Ulster title. Can play at full-back but a colossus at midfield and his absence from the county team has been a huge void. Tall, mobile and tough. The perfect midfielder.  – Sean Leo McGoldrick  The number on the jersey is irrelevant for Sean Leo, giving his possession game from wing back to wing forward. He has to be every managers dream. Busy, comfortable on the ball and always takes the right option. When Lavey threatened to stage their late comeback in the  final, it was Sean Leo at the heart of their insurance point.  – Enda Muldoon  Made his senior debut as a goalkeeper in the  McGlinchey Cup. The following season, he spearheaded Ballinderrys attack on their way to his first championship. It was the start of a stellar career of arguably the best club player of his generation. A chief scorer, a target for kick-outs and can pass the ball with effortless accuracy.  – Enda Lynn  Some county players fade away in club football. Enda Lynn is not one of them. Despite being kicked from pillar to post, as Greenloughs talisman, he led the Wee Reds from intermediate football to being seconds away from a senior county final. Handles the ball more than most and is potent as an inside forward.  - Raymond Wilkinson  Crook has played in a number of roles for Ballinderry. His two goals sank Kilrea in the  final and he found the net the following year to break Banaghers resolve in the semi-final. He has played both as busy link man in the half-forward line and inside for Shamrocks. He also made a comeback to play in recent years.  – Mark Lynch  Came to prominence as a  year old, in Derrys last All-Ireland minor win. Was always destined for greatness. Played up front for Banagher and led the line to perfection and his six points almost shot them into the county final. Switched to midfield when they won the intermediate title and last season, they were touching distance from the senior decider.  – Conleith Gilligan  Was Derry minors penalty scoring goalkeeper in . Three years later he led Ballinderry to All-Ireland sevens success as the fly keeper, but came to the fore as the playmaker for their All-Ireland club win. In his later years, he reinvented himself as an inside forward, where he carried their scoring mantle until he eventually retired.

The new system will be operational from Monday next, April , to assist in dealing with increasing requests from the public regarding excess refuse that has been accumulated as a result of the current emergency situation. Karen Phillips, Director for Environment and Regeneration with Derry City and Strabane District Council, told councillors yesterday that the new service would include a dedicated helpline that would be manned, Monday to Friday from am to pm, with a team of staff to process and categorise all calls. googletag.cmd.push The calls would be fed into a central system, that in turn will co-ordinate each request for collection by district ward, with each area being served on specic allocated days of the week. It was outlined to members that only excess residual, green and garden waste would be collected, with no provision being made for bulky waste collections, which unfortunately cannot be collected during this emergency situation. Collections would be carried out by area and on specic days of the week and only directly from domestic premises that have made pre-arranged collections with Council, with no kerbside waste being permitted. It was reiterated to members that this service is an emergency response to assist in resolving the increased pressure on waste services and the public will be strongly advised that they must continue to fully utilise the existing refuse collection services that continue to operate as normal. googletag.cmd.push The council said they will continue to put a strong emphasis on the recycling message, re-enforcing the need for the public to continue to maximise the use of their blue and brown bins. It is hoped that this additional service will assist in providing support to vulnerable members of the community and those with specic issues with medical or additional residual waste, such as larger families and will prevent fly-tipping. She reassured members that refuse collection staff providing this service would be adhering to strict social distancing guidelines and health and safety measures. She said checks to identy members of the public who are self-isolating would be done by staff prior to the collection being arranged. Members were informed that messaging and advice on double bagging also be communicated to those availing of the service, adding that the council would review the service on a daily basis and had the capacity to put additional resources in place according to demand. It was also outlined to members that the new service, while being operational from next week, would take a number of days to roll out and the public would be encouraged to be patient and co-operate with council during this process.

He said: ““We have been getting an increased number of calls from the public who have additional waste and following the Government directive to close our household recycling centres, have nowhere to take additional waste. We appreciate that many are spending more time at home and accumulating more waste however, we would encourage people to do all they can to reduce waste by reducing, recycling and reusing where possible. “Our refuse collection services are operating as normal and we feel that most people have adequate provision through this service. For those with larger families, or specic medical needs, we understand this is a dficult time and are keen to help. We hope that this new helpline will assist us in doing that and reach out to the people in our communities who need additional help and support.” He added: ““It is important that people note that we are dealing with a pandemic emergency situation therefore this is not the time to do a major spring clean and expect the Council to come pick up large pieces of furniture, mattresses or white goods. We do not have the capacity to do this during this time and would encourage the public to refrain from this type of work or to store it within their garages or sheds until our bulky waste service is operational again.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Behind his boyish grin, he is consuming the fading remnants of county final Sunday. Its all about savouring the scene where unforgettable memories were made. Every last second. In his interview with the County Derry Post, the Rossa forward confesses to not having attended many county finals. They were a dficult watch, like running your eyes over the dream you may never have. Now its real and over the hours and days which follow, Magherafelt would deservedly celebrate like never before. The clubs senior famine was over. googletag.cmd.push Three days later, McElhone would be back in the inner sanctum of a dressing room on final day, this time as a part of Enda Quinns U management team. In the midst of Monday nights celebrations, he had one eye on Lavey. They were going to be a tough assignment, he admitted. Any team with Matthew and Callum Downey on board was going to be a serious proposition. But, theyd give it a lash. When game day arrived, conditions were dficult, but it was Magherafelt who prevailed, adding to their senior, reserve, U , U and U championships. Their U, U and minor leagues were also added, on the back of being the current U champions – before withdrawing to concentrate on preparations for an Ulster clash with Kilcoo. googletag.cmd.push “The negative was, theydidnt get their proper nights sleep the few days before a vital championship game,” states Enda Quinn, who doubles up as the clubs current Youth Officer. They were amidst the celebrations, looking on as their heroes brought home the John McLaughlin Cup. “At the same time, you cant tell them to go home, because you may never see this in your letime again,” said Quinn, who had a son on the U squad. “The positive was that it gives you the ammunition to go again, after seeing what success had done. The show of senior players at thefinal...to a man they were all there. “They were coming down onto the field and they were making heroes out of our Us for winning a championship, it was unbelievable.” Eoin McEvoy and Aaron Murray picked up the Downey cousins. Earlier in the season McEvoy would anchor Ciaran Higgins minor defence from number six. He has a huge future ahead of him. Magherafelt went into the final without the services of Luke McCann who sustained a serious concussion in their drawn semi-final with Dungiven. “He was our full-back, he is a serious player and, last year, was playing on Derry Us,” Quinn added, tipping him for this years Derry minor team. Before a ball was kicked, Magherafelts chief rivals were Bellaghy and Lavey. However, Dungiven turned out to be the secret assassin after making progress during the season. WATERSHED MOMENT “When you saw the quality in the forward line, I wasnt overly surprised at it,” Quinn admits. “The highlight of our season was the replay against Dungiven. We were six points down, a man down, we were without Luke McCann and went on to beat them by six points in extra-time. To me, that was the watershed moment.” At minor level, Magherafelt won the league and pushed eventual Ulster champions Lavey every step of the way in the championship. From that squad, Eoghan Hawe and Johnny McErlain, along with players like Aidan McCluskey and Shea McGuckin - who are still eligible for club minors in  - will stepinto senior football next season. “We had a wide with the last kick and theygot a goal with a minute or two to go and us two points up. It couldve went either way and they went on to win Ulster, so at least you know you are there or thereabouts.”  Derry U champions Above the minor grade, Quinn hailed their U crop that would add to Adrian Cushs senior plans. Some of them had won Ulster minor medals with Derry and helped bring the MacRory Cup to St Marys Magherafelt for the first time. Below, at U level, Magherafelt lost to Dungiven in the Feacuteile final, but ed to clinch the league and championship double. “That was a big achievement there,” said Quinn, who spent countless years with Magherafelt youth teams. After chatting to a handful of Dungiven Gaels, they came to an agreement. Magherafelt were unlucky in the Feacuteile and lucky in the championship. It balanced itself out. Though they had to win the championship without one of the best U players in the county, Cahir Spiers, who was dismissed in their convincing semi-final win over Bellaghy. This seasons Feacuteile has since been cancelled, but Magherafelt wouldve be front runners again after winning the U championship at the tail end of last season and sharing the U AB competition, one for clubs who can field a second team.  Magherafelt won the U ladies championship It was also a year to remember for the clubs U ladies. In , they joined the boys in bringing home All-Ireland Feacuteile. “The girls came through after a really tight ding-duster with Ballinascreen. They have put in savage work and the year before had won the All-Ireland Feacuteile as well as the boys.” LEGACY Their season had a positive impact on all ages of club activity, but it was the manner of their senior football win that will leave the greatest legacy and a winning culture. Enda Quinns thoughts rush back to the start of the story. The championship draw was made on a Thursday night and for the second year in a row, they were pulled out to face the county champions, this time it was Coleraine. “On the Friday night we lost our best player, Michael McEvoy, to a cruciate injury,” Quinn adds. “I dont care what anybody says, your championship draw is everything. When you draw Slaughtneil or Coleraine, it is a downer.” He doesnt buy into needing to beat the best in the first round, it is all about getting a favourable draw. Aside from a comfortable win over Ballinascreen, the Rossa won their other three games by a point “The Coleraine game, they were reasonably in control of it until Emmettscored the goal. The Banagher game,it had went on a another five minutes, they couldve won it.  Magherafelt reserves also won the championship “We were playing champagne football for the first  minutes and going six or seven points up, we looked like we couldve won convincingly. At that stage, I thought wed win this game and really be in a position to compete with whoever came through the other semi-final. “Until we beat a Slaughtneil, Coleraine or Ballinderry, somebody like that, in the championship we werent serious contenders. “We dominated the final and we will be a better team for that. Plus, the fact you have Michael McEvoy back, as well as Peter Quinn and Ryan Ferris coming in.” During his own playing career, Quinn played at corner back up through the ranks before getting to senior. By that point, the spine of his team had drted away. Now, breaking onto the senior team is a dferent proposition. “Our retention of players is excellent at the minute, but it is now a case of how we get them all football that we need to look at.” Every year their senior squad has grown, bit by bit. Quinn looks back to their  All-Ireland Feacuteile winning team. Fergal Duffin, Antone McElhone and Shane Heavron have graduated to senior level, while another - were on the this year’s reserve winning team. “In  a good chunk of that team won a minor championship and were beat in the final at St Pauls. We have won four out of the last six Feacuteile titles.” Quinn still ranks Slaughtneil as the bestteam in Derry and refers to them doing so without a plethora of underage A titles. Beating Coleraine last season should be the beginning of a regular Magherafelt assault on the senior championship and something like  players at the first senior meeting of the season radiates the enthusiasm. Some will drt, but most will stay. “Nearly every one of our senior team has won something at underage, be it a Feacuteile, an U or a minor championship. When you are producing player after player, it gives you a better chance. “Like a lot of clubs, we have put a huge effort into our underage structures over the years and this is now starting to pay off.” Away from the pitch, coronavirus – like in all clubs – has put a stop to all activity. “I know the word is overused, but the buzz around the club was unbelievable . We just hope when the whole thing is back up and running again, that the buzz is still there. It was a fantastic opportunity for us to really push on from there.” Magherafelt had  tickets sold for last Saturdays Champions Dinner, which had to be postponed. It was ignited as a night of celebration for the senior and reserve team. It wasnt like the average gala with tables being sold for outsiders to wine and dine a table of strangers, in a fundraising capacity. It was a Magherafelt night for their own. “This was going to be the biggest ever gathering of Magherafelt people,” Quinn said. Getting a new date is the clubs plan. Its not that easy. When the current pandemic ends, fixtures will take priority, though the club are really determined to hold theat some point during . The recent upgrade of the clubs gym shows the commitment placed in the senior team. There is a thirst for more success. For the underage talent to have their glory days at a packed Celtic Park. “We are in a good place,” Quinn begins to conclude. “ was a fairytale. At the start of the year, you wouldnt dared to dream as high as that, in my opinion. “You have to lap it up and you have to enjoy it. In  you could win nothing and you may not win a senior championship for another  years. Who knows...but youd sincerely hope not. “We are in a good place, from a footballing point of view and from a club point of view this has been a huge gelling experience. You are a town club and it is hard to have the same level of camaraderie because it is so spread and there are so many things going on, but  has done an awful lot for us as a club.” The year was capped off when the Gerry Crossan Memorial Trophy was awarded, as Derry club of the year, at the annual Derry GAA presentationin Tullyglass. Not a single soul in theroom could disagree. It was the icing on the cake. RELATED - The year that changed a club. Click here...

Behind his boyish grin, he is consuming the fading remnants of county final Sunday. Its all about savouring the scene where unforgettable memories were made. Every last second. In his interview with the County Derry Post, the Rossa forward confesses to not having attended many county finals. They were a dficult watch, like running your eyes over the dream you may never have. Now its real and over the hours and days which follow, Magherafelt would deservedly celebrate like never before. The clubs senior famine was over. googletag.cmd.push Three days later, McElhone would be back in the inner sanctum of a dressing room on final day, this time as a part of Enda Quinns U management team. In the midst of Monday nights celebrations, he had one eye on Lavey. They were going to be a tough assignment, he admitted. Any team with Matthew and Callum Downey on board was going to be a serious proposition. But, theyd give it a lash. When game day arrived, conditions were dficult, but it was Magherafelt who prevailed, adding to their senior, reserve, U , U and U championships. Their U, U and minor leagues were also added, on the back of being the current U champions – before withdrawing to concentrate on preparations for an Ulster clash with Kilcoo. googletag.cmd.push “The negative was, theydidnt get their proper nights sleep the few days before a vital championship game,” states Enda Quinn, who doubles up as the clubs current Youth Officer. They were amidst the celebrations, looking on as their heroes brought home the John McLaughlin Cup. “At the same time, you cant tell them to go home, because you may never see this in your letime again,” said Quinn, who had a son on the U squad. “The positive was that it gives you the ammunition to go again, after seeing what success had done. The show of senior players at thefinal...to a man they were all there. “They were coming down onto the field and they were making heroes out of our Us for winning a championship, it was unbelievable.” Eoin McEvoy and Aaron Murray picked up the Downey cousins. Earlier in the season McEvoy would anchor Ciaran Higgins minor defence from number six. He has a huge future ahead of him. Magherafelt went into the final without the services of Luke McCann who sustained a serious concussion in their drawn semi-final with Dungiven. “He was our full-back, he is a serious player and, last year, was playing on Derry Us,” Quinn added, tipping him for this years Derry minor team. Before a ball was kicked, Magherafelts chief rivals were Bellaghy and Lavey. However, Dungiven turned out to be the secret assassin after making progress during the season. WATERSHED MOMENT “When you saw the quality in the forward line, I wasnt overly surprised at it,” Quinn admits. “The highlight of our season was the replay against Dungiven. We were six points down, a man down, we were without Luke McCann and went on to beat them by six points in extra-time. To me, that was the watershed moment.” At minor level, Magherafelt won the league and pushed eventual Ulster champions Lavey every step of the way in the championship. From that squad, Eoghan Hawe and Johnny McErlain, along with players like Aidan McCluskey and Shea McGuckin - who are still eligible for club minors in  - will stepinto senior football next season. “We had a wide with the last kick and theygot a goal with a minute or two to go and us two points up. It couldve went either way and they went on to win Ulster, so at least you know you are there or thereabouts.”  Derry U champions Above the minor grade, Quinn hailed their U crop that would add to Adrian Cushs senior plans. Some of them had won Ulster minor medals with Derry and helped bring the MacRory Cup to St Marys Magherafelt for the first time. Below, at U level, Magherafelt lost to Dungiven in the Feacuteile final, but ed to clinch the league and championship double. “That was a big achievement there,” said Quinn, who spent countless years with Magherafelt youth teams. After chatting to a handful of Dungiven Gaels, they came to an agreement. Magherafelt were unlucky in the Feacuteile and lucky in the championship. It balanced itself out. Though they had to win the championship without one of the best U players in the county, Cahir Spiers, who was dismissed in their convincing semi-final win over Bellaghy. This seasons Feacuteile has since been cancelled, but Magherafelt wouldve be front runners again after winning the U championship at the tail end of last season and sharing the U AB competition, one for clubs who can field a second team.  Magherafelt won the U ladies championship It was also a year to remember for the clubs U ladies. In , they joined the boys in bringing home All-Ireland Feacuteile. “The girls came through after a really tight ding-duster with Ballinascreen. They have put in savage work and the year before had won the All-Ireland Feacuteile as well as the boys.” LEGACY Their season had a positive impact on all ages of club activity, but it was the manner of their senior football win that will leave the greatest legacy and a winning culture. Enda Quinns thoughts rush back to the start of the story. The championship draw was made on a Thursday night and for the second year in a row, they were pulled out to face the county champions, this time it was Coleraine. “On the Friday night we lost our best player, Michael McEvoy, to a cruciate injury,” Quinn adds. “I dont care what anybody says, your championship draw is everything. When you draw Slaughtneil or Coleraine, it is a downer.” He doesnt buy into needing to beat the best in the first round, it is all about getting a favourable draw. Aside from a comfortable win over Ballinascreen, the Rossa won their other three games by a point “The Coleraine game, they were reasonably in control of it until Emmettscored the goal. The Banagher game,it had went on a another five minutes, they couldve won it.  Magherafelt reserves also won the championship “We were playing champagne football for the first  minutes and going six or seven points up, we looked like we couldve won convincingly. At that stage, I thought wed win this game and really be in a position to compete with whoever came through the other semi-final. “Until we beat a Slaughtneil, Coleraine or Ballinderry, somebody like that, in the championship we werent serious contenders. “We dominated the final and we will be a better team for that. Plus, the fact you have Michael McEvoy back, as well as Peter Quinn and Ryan Ferris coming in.” During his own playing career, Quinn played at corner back up through the ranks before getting to senior. By that point, the spine of his team had drted away. Now, breaking onto the senior team is a dferent proposition. “Our retention of players is excellent at the minute, but it is now a case of how we get them all football that we need to look at.” Every year their senior squad has grown, bit by bit. Quinn looks back to their  All-Ireland Feacuteile winning team. Fergal Duffin, Antone McElhone and Shane Heavron have graduated to senior level, while another - were on the this year’s reserve winning team. “In  a good chunk of that team won a minor championship and were beat in the final at St Pauls. We have won four out of the last six Feacuteile titles.” Quinn still ranks Slaughtneil as the bestteam in Derry and refers to them doing so without a plethora of underage A titles. Beating Coleraine last season should be the beginning of a regular Magherafelt assault on the senior championship and something like  players at the first senior meeting of the season radiates the enthusiasm. Some will drt, but most will stay. “Nearly every one of our senior team has won something at underage, be it a Feacuteile, an U or a minor championship. When you are producing player after player, it gives you a better chance. “Like a lot of clubs, we have put a huge effort into our underage structures over the years and this is now starting to pay off.” Away from the pitch, coronavirus – like in all clubs – has put a stop to all activity. “I know the word is overused, but the buzz around the club was unbelievable . We just hope when the whole thing is back up and running again, that the buzz is still there. It was a fantastic opportunity for us to really push on from there.” Magherafelt had  tickets sold for last Saturdays Champions Dinner, which had to be postponed. It was ignited as a night of celebration for the senior and reserve team. It wasnt like the average gala with tables being sold for outsiders to wine and dine a table of strangers, in a fundraising capacity. It was a Magherafelt night for their own. “This was going to be the biggest ever gathering of Magherafelt people,” Quinn said. Getting a new date is the clubs plan. Its not that easy. When the current pandemic ends, fixtures will take priority, though the club are really determined to hold theat some point during . The recent upgrade of the clubs gym shows the commitment placed in the senior team. There is a thirst for more success. For the underage talent to have their glory days at a packed Celtic Park. “We are in a good place,” Quinn begins to conclude. “ was a fairytale. At the start of the year, you wouldnt dared to dream as high as that, in my opinion. “You have to lap it up and you have to enjoy it. In  you could win nothing and you may not win a senior championship for another  years. Who knows...but youd sincerely hope not. “We are in a good place, from a footballing point of view and from a club point of view this has been a huge gelling experience. You are a town club and it is hard to have the same level of camaraderie because it is so spread and there are so many things going on, but  has done an awful lot for us as a club.” The year was capped off when the Gerry Crossan Memorial Trophy was awarded, as Derry club of the year, at the annual Derry GAA presentationin Tullyglass. Not a single soul in theroom could disagree. It was the icing on the cake. RELATED - The year that changed a club. Click here...

The health trust is also enhancing care at home packages for the vulnerable and elderly in the community.Mr Hazzard said the local community will be understandably concerned about the ldquodramatic changes to the hospital and that some may even be angry.ldquoDuring this global health emergency, we must put our faith and support in the expert health practitioners who are best placed to take these decisions, he continued.ldquoI welcome the public commitment from the South Eastern Trust that these are strictly temporary measures to meet the unprecedented challenges represented by the coronavirus pandemic and will not become a permanent reality.Mr Hazzard said that in the days ahead, many queries and issues will arise from the health trustrsquos decision, both from the public and those who work in the health and social care system.He declared: ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to engage with the health trust and other agencies to ensure there is public confidence in this radical approach.ldquoWith this in mind we have written to the Ambulance Service to ask that they urgently reassess their capacity to meet the subsequent needs of our local community on the back of this announcement.Mr Hazzard also appealed to the community to do all in its power to help and assist health and social care workers who find themselves at the frontline in the battle against COVID-.He added: ldquoThey are doing an incredible job in the most challenging of circumstances to keep us all safe. We must demonstrate real social solidarity in order to help and support them in the unprecedented crisis ahead..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 A\u0026E.jpg","title":"A%26E shut in Downe  ","story":"THE Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department has been temporarily closed as part of sweeping changes implemented by health chiefs preparing for the expected surge in coronavirus cases.The department closed on Monday morning with critical care staff and some equipment relocated to the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as part of a radical overhaul of services to cope with the global pandemic.The day procedure unit, outpatients department and minor injuries service at the Downpatrick hospital have also been closed, but the critically important GP out-of-hours service remains operational.Inpatient wards and acute mental heath and psychiatry services for the elderly remain open, as does the hospitalrsquos midwery-led unit, but no births are being allowed to take place for the time being.The South Eastern Trust said that as the organisation prepares ldquofor the biggest challenge it has ever faced it needs to reshape its hospitals and other services on a temporary basis to maximise its ability to ldquomanage the surge in demand for services due to COVID-.While local politicians have reluctantly accepted the closure of several key services at the Downe as part of a reconfiguration plan, they say public and private assurances from senior health trust officials that the changes are temporary must be honoured and all services fully restored when the crisis is over.News of the closure of the Downersquos emergency department and other services came ahead of confirmation that the Downpatrick hospital is one of  locations across the Province which has been designated as a primary care COVID- assessment centre which is expected to open before the end of the week.The new centre mdash designed to help manage the expected increase in coronavirus cases in the community mdash will allow patients who are showing symptoms of the virus to be separated from those with non COVID- conditions.Health chiefs insist that the new service is ldquoessential to ensure that vital GP services can be maintained over the coming weeks and months with minimum disruption.The new centre is not a testing facility and is only there for patients who are unwell and suspected of having the virus and require medical attention. Patients will not be able to report directly to the centre without being referred by their own GP or the Downersquos out-of-hours service.In addition, patients attending the centre will receive appropriate treatment, assessment and,necessary, onward referral to hospital.The new centre is designed to allow GPs and health and social care staff to work together in a suitable clinical environment and to plan what is best for the inidual in terms of treatment and any additional care they need.Defending the decision to close a number of services at the Downe Hospital, the South Eastern Trust says that each of its hospitals and services has a vital role to play in the fight against COVID-.ldquoWe must now make changes to some services in all of our hospitals to prepare for the additional critical care services needed and to achieve the best possible outcomes for our patients, it said in a statement.ldquoWe must deploy our staff and resources to best position us to provide the critical care which will be required for our local populations and to give our staff the essential training they need in order to equip them as much as possible for the challenge ahead.The health trust says that it needs to ensure that its staff can be as prepared as possible to help fight the impact of COVID-.The statement continued: ldquoRetraction of the most acute services from some sites, in a planned manner, is the best way to support our entire patient population and gives our staff the best chance to prepare for and manage the challenges and pressures upon us.ldquoThe Downe Hospital will play a vital role as part of the hospital network in responding to this crisis, particularly through the provision of inpatient services and through working alongside primary care to enable as many patients as possible to be cared for at home.Health chiefs say they believe it is imperative to respond now to provide the local community with the best possible outcomes and also to support staff as best it can.The health trust says it recognises the importance and value of all its sites and services within its communities.The statement adds: ldquoThe Trust would like to assure the community that changes made over the coming weeks and months are solely part of the effort to meet and manage the challenges presented by COVID-, the scale of which we have never faced before.ldquoAll service changes will continue to be reviewed and monitored, with the intention to fully restore services to normal as soon as possible. Every one of us has a role to play in the fight against coronavirus. We urge the public to help us protect themselves and others by staying at home and following all advice.Health chiefs say that with the situation rapidly changing plans must continue to be flexible and have asked for everyonersquos commitment and support ldquoduring these most dficult times..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call on public to tidy up dog mess  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has called on dog owners across the district to clean up after their pets.Rowallane politician Kathryn Owen expressed particular concern about the issue in Saintfield, describing the area between the townrsquos health centre and pharmacy as ldquodisgustingrsquo.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, particularly to children, as the faeces includes roundworm eggs which become infectious after about three weeks and can remain so for up to two years.Just one pile of dog dirt can contain a million roundworm eggs and can lead to stomach upsets, throat infections, asthma and, in some cases, blindness in humans.Given the ongoing battle to contain the deadly coronavirus, Cllr Owen said the last thing needed is a battle against another disease.She said that with many more people at home and likely to remain so for the next few weeks, the number of dog owners taking their pets for a walk will increase.ldquoWe donrsquot have the same level of street cleansing being done at the moment as Newry, Mourne and Down Council is operating with skeleton staff, explained Cllr Owen.ldquoI am appealing to dog owners to take waste bags with them and please clean up after their pets. We are trying to fight onedisease, we donrsquot need to fight another one.Pointing to the disgusting state of the footpath which links the health centre at the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield with a pharmacy in nearby Main Street, Cllr Owen appealed to dog owners to be more considerate ldquoso everyone can enjoy thewelcome breath of fresh air with the pets.Her concern comes two weeks after another Rowallane councillor, Billy Walker, urged the local authority to press ahead with a plan to arm enforcement staff with body cameras in a bid to help address the districtrsquos dog fouling and fly-tipping issues.The move mdash along with using CCTV cameras to help identy offenders mdash is currently being examined by local authority officials.Last year, an enforcement action plan to tackle the dog dirt problem was agreed by the local authority which is also working with the Dogs Trust to promote responsible pet ownership across the district to reduce dog fouling.Cllr Walker said elected representatives have been ldquoinundated with complaints from ratepayers about the dog fouling issue and reaffirmed that he is keen for existing legislation to be strengthened to deal with offenders.He also cautioned against painting all ratepayers with the same brush as there are many who clean up after their pets.ldquoWe clearly need an action plan to deal with issues which are a blight on our district, he declared.ldquoI have consistently called for law breakers to be lsquonamed and shamedrsquo and council officials are seeking legal advice on such a move and any implication doing this would have on data protection legislation, said the Rowallane councillor.He added: ldquoEveryone has a responsibility and a duty of care to make sure they clean up after their pets. Dog dirt is not only unsightly but poses a health risk to young children in particular.ldquoIf people break the law they should be heavily fined and named and shamed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Singer.jpg","title":"Castlewellan singer becomes online sensation  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN grandfather has penned a song in praise of the selfless effort made by NHS workers during the COVID- pandemic.Terry Cowan has become a Facebook sensation during the lockdown with his performances of popular Irish songs.The traditional musician and singer wrote the song, Our Teamrsquos Thatrsquos Dressed in Blue, with one of his daughters very much in mind as shersquos a nurse.So far the ballad has racked up more than , views on social media.Terryrsquos Facebook fame began when he performed several songs on St Patrickrsquos Day ndash and itrsquos been growing ever since.The -year-old businessman says therersquos a growing demand for emigration songs from people who are apart from their sons and daughters.Terry, who runs Financial Directions and Property Directions in his home town, said his new found fame came about due to feeling bored on St Patrickrsquos Day when he was self-isolating at home with his we Patricia.ldquoThis has blown out of all proportion, to be honest, I did not understand the power of social media, said Terry.ldquoI was bored out of my brains on St Patrickrsquos Day and my we, Patricia, suggested that I record a couple of songs on Facebook and thatrsquos what I did. I chose Three Leafed Shamrock and If We Only Had Old Ireland Over Here because they mentioned shamrocks and I got , views in  hours. Irsquove got comments from America, Netherlands, Europe, Australia.ldquoNormally our St Patrickrsquos Day consists of going to mass in Castlewellan, then heading to the Lodge and entertaining the community until lunchtime where everybody comes in for a bit of craic. Then we take the grandkids around ious venues where they all play and then itrsquos back home at about pm.Terry is the father of three daughters, the eldest being Slieve Croob councillor Roisin Howell, whose son Ruaacuteiriacute is currently the youngest ever over- All-Ireland Uilleann piper. His other two daughters are Cara and Aine.The love of traditional Irish music runs deep in Terryrsquos family with eight of his  grandchildren all musicians.ldquoI have been in self-isolation since my daughter Cara, whorsquos a nurse, advised me to stay in as I have type  diabetes, explained Terry.He continued with his Saturday night singalong for Motherrsquos Day recently when he played such favourites as A Mothers Loversquos A Blessing, Home and The Town I love So Well.Terry says that he will continue to perform every Saturday until the COVID- shutdown is lted. He plans to perform songs with an emigration flavour such as Song For Ireland, My Fatherrsquos House, Boston Rose and a medley of Rambles of Spring The Old Dungarvan Oak.ldquoThe songs are touching a chord with people who are far away from family at home so Irsquom getting a lot of requests, nearly too many to do all of them. I have people who are telling me that they are in tears at forwarding on a song to their son or daughter whorsquos where, added Terry.ldquoIrsquom getting - comments a time, I feel humbled. A lot of people are thanking me for lting their spirits and taking their minds of the situation now. The reason Irsquom keeping it going is for the health and wellbeing of the people in the community. The response Irsquove got from people in Downpatrick has been amazing.ldquoSadly, Irsquom very conscious that I hope that the people who are listening to me now will still be listening to me in six monthsrsquo time.Like many other people who are in self-isolation now, Terry is thinking of better days ahead.ldquoWouldnrsquot it be great to go on to a football field and host a massive concert after this is all over to say thank you to all those NHS and key workers who are looking after us all, he said.ldquoWe donrsquot know how long this is going to last, so in the meantime Irsquom going try and continue to sing an odd old song.

All of the centres are monitored by CCTV.While all council meetings have been cancelled, it is understood that the permanent closure decision was taken after talks between council officials and the leaders of the local authorityrsquos main parties.In February, the Recorder revealed that the local authority was considering closing sites in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch on a Sunday, traditionally one of their busiest days of the week, with staff trade union representatives consulted on the issue.It is understood that a number of reasons were cited by local authority officials considering a Sunday closure, including the fact that the other civic amenity sites in Camlough, Crossmaglen, Kilkeel, Newry, Newtownhamilton Warrenpoint and Hilltown already close on Sunday.They were previously under the management of the former Newry and Mourne Council, while civic amenity sites in Down District have always been open on a Sunday.Council officials also revealed recently that they discovered that ratepayers in other parts of the district whose local amenity site is closed on a Sunday were using the sites in Down District.There are also reports of ratepayers in the Ards and North Down Council area using the Downpatrick and Ballynahinch sites on Sundays.The temporary closure of all civic amenity sites comes after it was announced recently that the district is recycling just over  per cent of its waste, passing the Northern Ireland average for the first time. The total amount of waste being recycled locally has increased by five percent.In relation to the recycling centre in Downpatrick, local council officials are working to have mains power connected to the Flying Horse Road.They were forced to hire a generator at a weekly cost to ratepayers of pound to power lights, staff accommodation and some specialised skips and containers which are capable of compacting materials.Council officials are asking ratepayers who have any queries to visit recycling@nmandd.org and they will endeavour to respond to you as quickly as they can..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar child wants people to have Faith as she offers advice  ","story":"A LITTLE Crossgar girl has become an internet sensation with her public safety plea urging people to fight the coronavirus outbreak.Four year-old Faith McGreevy was captured on video by her mother, Lisa, last week repeating the public health warning to combat COVID-.ldquoYou have to stay in the house for two weeks or maybe  weeks, says Faith in her message. ldquoAnd when you stay in your house and stop going everywhere, like SuperValu, then the bug will go away.Faith, who attends the nursery at Cedar Integrated Primary School, adds thateveryone does what they are told ldquothe bug would go away soon and then we could go everywhere again.Faith says that when she grows up she wants to be a doctor because she likes to make people well again, or maybe a cleaner because she loves helping her mum tidying the house ndash she canrsquot decide yet.Her mum says she has a ldquoterric grasp of current affairs and is never short of an answer.Describing her daughter as being ldquono mug, she said: ldquoWhen me and her dad Robbie wanted to wean her off the dummy we told her she should give it to Santa.ldquoShe agreed saying it was a great idea, but could she have the other dummy that was in the kitchen drawer.Faith seems to be coping well with not being at school over the past few weeks due to the lockdown.Lisa said: ldquoSometimes Faith would ask me why canrsquot she canrsquot play with her friends, but in general she is coping very well with the nursery closure.ldquoIt is a great opportunity to bond more with her little brother, one year-old Eoin.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
