However, in all the time that I’ve been immersed in music in its many different forms, I’ve never attempted to make my own. I had a keyboard when I was nine or 10, but that was as far as it went. The closest I came to getting into music production was when I worked at a music school and I was allowed to take a production course for free. But, sadly, I had to drop out because I had so much going on in my personal life. But the hunger is still there. I’ll often play tunes on my 21-month-old daughter’s musical toys. However, when it comes to trying my hand at music production, I struggle to know where to begin. There is an abundance of information available online, from simple beginners lessons, all the way up to advanced masterclasses for those wishing to brush up on their engineering skills. With the advancement and democratisation of music production technology over the past couple of decades, bedroom producers are commonplace and many of those who’ve become adept at making music kindly share their experiences online. Finding something relevant to meet my needs proves a tad overwhelming, however, and I get lost in a sea of waveforms, EQ tips and info on achieving a decent level of dB. So I turn to TikTok, using simple hashtag searches. The hashtag #MusicProductionBeginners brings up a host of user-generated videos that really help cut through the noise, so to speak. One of the producers I encounter is Kade, who posts TikTok videos under the handle @musicbykade. He manages to break down how music production works in perhaps the simplest way I’ve ever heard, hailing the convenience of loops – little repetitive clips of music that can be used as the foundation for myriad genres. For me, I was angling to try my hand at a bit of “doof doof” – loud electronic music centred on a bass-heavy kick drum. Kade’s video uses GarageBand, free software for Apple Mac users, but I use another free platform called Waveform. The basic premise and layout for most production software is the same, so I follow his succinctly delivered tip to download some loops, put them into Waveform and get started. He recommends a site called cymatics.fm, where there are free loops and I start downloading house music samples to finally take my first baby steps into the world of production. Another TikTok creator, Mikey C, drops a gem in his own series of production tips: “Here’s my best advice for first-time producers – your first songs are not going to be hits, so don’t spend forever on them,” he says. Nothing technical there, but it’s solid gold for anyone who has lofty ambitions and feels frustrated when they can’t match up to their favourite artist. Learning the basics is about exploration and experimentation, not relentlessly overworking your very first attempt at a track – Mikey C’s video was less than 30 seconds long, but his tip probably saved me hours and hours of fruitless tinkering. Another of his videos suggests reaching the chorus of a song within 45 seconds. “Anything later is going to be too long of a wait and you’re going to lose listeners,” he says. While I’m nowhere near making a song yet, it’s incredibly useful to have an experienced producer share a key tip that’s easily remembered. On my hashtag travels, I stop off at Sarah Maddack’s account. Maddack has more than a million followers and describes herself as “the silliest rapper you know”. Her comedic approach is immediately disarming. Not afraid to laugh at herself, she explains how to create the sound of a “crowd” screaming by recording different types of screams with your own voice, and then layering them to create a multi-scream, group effect. I have a microphone, which I usually use to record podcasts and radio shows, so I decide to put it to use in my new producer “lab” and record my own voice. Another video I find incredibly helpful is a demonstration of how to make field recordings from TikTok creator Arthur Caplan. “You’ve reached sound design TikTok,” says the text on his video. There’s no talking, just text explaining what he’s doing. So I take my dictaphone outside to get some recordings of the trains going past on the local line, birds chirping in the trees, and the trusty sounds of people running. The simplicity of the tips I discover on TikTok have helped me take the plunge into a world that I had always felt some trepidation towards. I’ve learned that music production doesn’t have to be this grand expedition, where you spend hours meticulously arranging and creating sounds. It can be as basic as recording the sound of leaves blowing in the wind, grabbing some premade loops and basslines, talking into a mic, uploading it all into your production software and simply having fun with it. Just don’t ask me to play any of the “music” I’ve made so far. "},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown is lifting could tiktok help you re learn how to socialise","story":"The reality was, as much as I longed to see my friends and my family, the thought of getting back out there was a daunting prospect. Feelings of self-doubt and a sudden lack of confidence consumed me. Like many people, I’ve been wondering how to actually socialise again. My anxiety levels have skyrocketed. Lockdown has played tricks with my ego and confidence. The question has been what to do about it. As a busy mum-of-three, I don’t exactly have bags of spare time. During lockdown I’d become intrigued by TikTok. I’d looked at some of the uplifting videos that had gone viral and grabbed the whole world’s attention. But I sensed there was more to TikTok than just dance fads. Could its wealth of videos about every subject under the sun help me regain my social skills and self-confidence? I start my exploration of motivational TikTok videos by granting myself permission for some basic “me time”. Given my hectic schedule, I’ve never really been one for so-called “me time” – but watching and listening to some everyday women with little sprinklings of genius on TikTok really made me stop and think: hold on, it is actually about me. “You can’t give to your family from an empty cup,” explains TikTok creator @ivanarichey – one of her many short and snappy pearls of wisdom. I scoffed at it at first, and thought what a cliche. But then I realised that, actually, if I go down, then pretty much the whole ship goes down too. From then on, whenever I could grab five minutes in between the school run and dinnertime, I’d have a quick browse at some other motivational accounts to give me that extra perk I needed to make it through to bedtime. “Compliment yourself, praise yourself,” says TikTok creator @spencer.barbosa, whose motivational gems and quick and quirky style tips will perk you up in an instant. Another of her quotes that I loved was: “You don’t have to be the best, just be the best version of yourself.” I don’t know what it was that made me more receptive to heeding advice in this format. It could have been the sincerity and authenticity of the TikTok creators themselves. It could have been their uplifting vibe or disarming humour. Or it could have been the snappy, no-nonsense format. But pretty soon, I was hooked. I honestly hadn’t actually realised until now just how important and effective it is to consciously lift yourself up, dust off that crown, and so on. Suddenly, the prospect of seeing my friends and socialising again after nearly 18 months didn’t seem so daunting. One of the things I used to love doing before lockdown was get a makeover in the lead-up to a glam event. Given that this has not been an option for quite some time, I wondered if I’d ever be glam again and didn’t want to shock people when they saw me in person. I realised I was a far cry from my filtered image on social media. So I started scrolling for quick makeovers for those of us with not much time to spare. And @thepatriciabright was just the tonic I needed to give me the lift to get my face back on and get back out there. Her videos were great for providing seemingly instant glam, and they were so funny, too – especially when she teamed up with her hubby for a parody clip. It’s amazing what a sprinkling of gold dust over your cheekbones can do. And makeup artist @dominiqueallison taught me some awesome mum tricks to hide those bags by putting a slick of concealer on over your foundation. She also whipped up some funky retro looks for when we are allowed to go #outout again. I’m also a big fan of videos posted by @jaimykoroma and @werejagreeneyes, which had me in hysterics with her life hacks in ultra-short, 10-second videos. A change was coming and it didn’t have to be scary. Something remarkable was happening. Thanks to TikTok, I realised I could love life – and myself – after lockdown.

As a result of the recent cyberattack on the HSE’s systems, there had been no new reports of Covid-19 deaths since Friday, May 14th, when the State’s total death toll stood at 4,941. Speaking at a weekly briefing on Thursday, the HSE’s chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said there had been eight deaths from Covid-19 in the 12 days from the data breach to Wednesday. The latest figures will bring the number of reported deaths in May as a result of Covid-19 to 43. Dr Henry said the number of deaths from the disease had “collapsed” as a result of the Covid-19 vaccination programme being targeted at elderly people first, who are much more at risk of dying as a result of Covid-19. There were 2,234 new Covid-19 cases in the second week in January in the over-75s. As a result of the vaccination programme, there have been just 65 cases per week in that age group in the last fortnight. “Hospitalisations, deaths and outbreaks – anything associated with the vaccinated populations have collapsed,” Dr Henry said. He said there is a “steady level” of disease happening at present, but it is being concentrated in the under-45s. The Department of Health has revised its Covid-19 figures since the data breach. In the 12 days after the cyberattack on the HSE there were 5,133 new cases, an average of 428 a day. This is 140 more cases than the 4,993 cases that were originally reported for the period. Northern Ireland’s Department of Health, meanwhile, reported 84 new cases of Covid-19 and no further fatalities on Thursday. There have been no deaths with Covid-19 in the last seven days, compared to three the week before.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

This consists of the planned 200m doses plus 50m doses, accelerated from their scheduled delivery later in 2021.“Any minor variation in a delivery as part of this plan is a result of us ensuring equitable distribution within the bloc of those accelerated doses over the coming weeks.”The HSE does not know how many Johnson\u0026ampJohnson vaccines it will receive, but the number could at best be just half of the 600,000 expected. At worst it could be just 64,000.So far 60,000 Johnson\u0026ampJohnson doses have been received this month, most of which have been administered. A small delivery is due over this weekend, he told reporters..Speaking in the Dáil on Thursday, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly told Sinn Féin’s David Cullinane that reaching the 82 per cent target by the end of June for first doses depended on supply.“Anyone who wants a vaccine should be fully vaccinated by the end of September,” he declared, adding that half of all adults will have received their first dose by the end of this week.Take-upSpeaking at the HSE briefing, the HSE chief executive said that 2.6 million people have received a vaccine dose: 1.6 million first doses and 800,000 second doses.The take-up of vaccines is 98.4 per cent among those over 80 95.5 per cent among 70 year olds and 89.1 per cent among 60 year olds. Among those in their 50s, where vaccination is continuing, the take-up is 78.5 per cent.Between 304,000 and 314,000 people got a vaccine last week. This week, the target will be between 260,000 to 280,000 at 37 mass -vaccination centres. A new centre opens in University College Dublin next week.Mr Reid rejected Dáil complaints by rural TDs about long journey times to some vaccination centres, with some Deputies alleging the vaccination rollout was biased towards Dublin.The Republic has more centres per head of population than Northern Ireland, Mr Reid pointed out – where there is one per 100,000 people, compared to one per 300,000.While patients living in rural Ireland have faced longer journeys to vaccination centres, he pointed out that in Dublin and other areas patients can face equally long journeys in bad traffic.Ambulance staff are dealing with almost 4,000 referrals for administering the vaccine, officials said. Some 940 patients did not require vaccination and 240 are still waiting for one.Eight people have died with Covid-19 since May 15th.The number of B.1617.2 variant cases – the so-called Indian variant – has risen to 97, with another 58 cases of a related sub-type, B.1617.1, recorded, the HSE said.Second doseMeanwhile, it emerged that 240 people who are unable to leave their homes because of age and illness have yet to receive a first vaccine dose. So far 2,700 others have got a first jab, while 1,400 have received their second dose.Minister of State for Older People Mary Butler said the work was being carried out by the National Ambulance Service. Each visit takes at least 30 minutes, and sometimes longer.Minister of State Anne Rabbitte said most people in homes for the disabled or those enjoying daycare services among the 271,000 Cohort IV high-risk group have received a first jab. Some 11 per cent have been fully vaccinated.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"o devaney gardens homes could be sold to institutional investors","story":"The O’Devaney Gardens social housing complex near the Phoenix Park in Dublin 7 currently under construction. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe None of the 1,047 homes planned for the site of O’Devaney Gardens in Dublin 7 will be protected by new planning rules to prevent “bulk buying” of homes by investment companies, it has emerged.Almost all of the new homes at O’Devaney Gardens will be apartments, with just 43 houses and duplexes ringfenced from bulk sales. However, all these houses and duplexes are already earmarked for use for social or affordable housing and won’t be offered to the private market.The Government earlier this month decided to increase stamp duty to 10 per cent on the purchase of more than 10 houses, to discourage bulk buying. In addition, Mr O’Brien said he intended to introduce planning legislation to prevent institutional investors buying out housing estates. He said he would examine whether apartments could be included in the scheme.However, on Wednesday Mr O’Brien said he had already issued a directive to planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála blocking the sale of homes to institutional investors.GuidelinesUnder these ministerial guidelines applications for five or more houses or duplexes will be subject to conditions confining their sale or use to inidual purchasers and those eligible for social and affordable housing, including cost-rental housing. However, these rules, issued last week, do not apply to apartments.Under an agreement reached with the council two years ago, 30 per cent of the O’Devaney Gardens homes will be reserved for social housing and 20 per cent for affordable purchase. The remaining 50 per cent are described as “developer units”, which Bartra can sell privately.Bartra offered to make 30 of these private apartments available for a cost-rental scheme. A spokesman for the company said on Thursday discussions with the council and approved housing bodies on this offer were still ongoing.Planning permission is not contingent on a cost-rental scheme going ahead at O’Devaney Gardens, and if the negotiations are not successful, Bartra can sell the 523 apartments privately. The spokesman said it had not been decided if these would be sold in bulk to an investment firm and no decisions would be made until negotiations on the potential cost-rental sales had concluded.More than 80 per cent of the new homes will be one- and two-bedroom apartments, with 318 one-beds, 567 two-beds and 162 three-bed homes. Bartra said it hopes to be on-site before the end of this year, with the scheme developed in phases over three years.Social homesSeparately, the council is currently building 56 social homes at O’Devaney Gardens, which are due for completion in the first quarter of next year.The new estate will be significantly larger than the 1950s complex of just under 300 flats which were demolished in phases over the last decade.The dilapidated complex was to have been redeveloped under a public-private partnership between the council and developer Bernard McNamara but, after several delays, the deal collapsed in mid-2008.The council drew up plans to redevelop the estate using public money but in late 2012 conceded it could not secure the €32 million needed and shelved the project.In December 2016 the council got sanction from the Department of Housing to build the first 56 social homes. In January 2017 the council agreed to seek tenders to develop the site with a 50 per cent private, 30 per cent social and 20 per cent affordable housing mix.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"spring lane halting site we are like people living in the third world","story":"Bridget McCarthy with daughters Margaret (6) and Katie Scarlet (11) of Spring Lane halting site.

Photograph: Daragh Mc SweeneyProvisionKieran McCarthy with his son Kieran and extended family at Spring Lane halting site in Cork city. Photograph:  Daragh McSweeneyProvisionStanding near her storm-damaged mobile home in the Spring Lane halting site on Cork’s northside, Michelle Delaney says her two-year-old daughter sleeps nightly in a cupboard-sized room wet because of the leaks.Today Delaney, despite this week’s scathing report from the Ombudsman for Children’s Office about conditions on the halting site, believes Cork City Council will only take action after someone dies.Electricity wires have been chewed by rats, she says. “As you can see, the wire is naked. Where there is a hole in the roof the wire is directly underneath it. The water seeps through.“I could be electrocuted here, as could my child. I was in fear over this. I got on to the council. I told them I would take anything. I asked for emergency accommodation. I am very upset,” she declares.Spring Lane was originally a gravel quarry before it was turned in to a 10-bay halting site in 1989. Today 38 families, including 66 children, live there, says the council. The inhabitants put the number of families at 50.Before her mother died from cancer in 2013, she picked up a bacterial infection, which Delaney blames on communal toilets that were built for 40 people, but today have to be used by up to 140 daily.She is despairing of people who say that Travellers have “a grand life”. “I would say to them, ‘Come here and see.’ People in here are crying out for houses. We are forgotten about. I would live in a house in the morning.”Raw sewage is one of life’s hazards at Spring Lane, with one mother telling how her toddler daughter recently tripped and landed in a puddle of waste. Days later, one of her tiny shoes was still floating in the excrement.Eleven-year-old Margaret McCarthy offers a child’s view. “It is not fair for the children to live like this. There is nothing to do. We get up for school and it’s freezing. We get filthy in the mud going up to school.“There are no play things. It is very dirty. We would like a house. Because of Covid, you can’t go nowhere. The only place we go is to the shop and back. We have no proper toilets. We have no privacy here,” she goes on.“People sometimes come for a look around and they are shaming us. They are looking at us and laughing. It is discrimination,” says Margaret, who is proud to be a Traveller, but bridles at the discrimination endured.Her eight- year-old brother Tommy would love to live in a house, too. Often, he says, he watches rats running around the halting site. He asks if this reporter works for the council.Then he requests that The  to talk “to the mayor” about getting his family “somewhere nice to live with toilets that flush”, as he points a to communal toilet and treacherous floors that are dangerous to walk on.Saying that children “like her” are forgotten about, his cousin Teresa McCarthy (12) says she can never find anywhere quiet to do her school homework because Spring Lane is always so crowded.Traveller kids are barred from shops without their parents, or else they are told that they cannot come in without masks, even though settled children are not required to wear masks, she goes on.“If we walk in to a shop they watch us. It is a horrible feeling. You can’t just look around. Everyone stares at us. We are discriminated against,” she says, adding that the toilets and washrooms on the site are “depressing”.The facilities upset the adults, too. Some of the Portakabins, which are not insulated, do not have hot water, while some of the toilets are used so often that they do not flush properly, or at all.“Sewage. I have a pain in my throat from complaining about it,” says one mother, who chooses not to be named. “You would do better in prison. These two bays are the worst. Look at the potholes.“The water drips into my mobile. I have been down to the council one hundred times. I showed the council videos of my kids in the sewage. I asked if they would like their kids to walk in sewage.“They say they will send someone. The toilets don’t work. Everything is broken,” she goes on, becoming emotional as she talks about how her elderly father, who has suffered two heart attacks, has gone to friends “for a break”.Pointing to a small sofa in his mobile home, she said he rarely moved from it because it was one of the few places in the home unaffected by leaks. “You can see the imprint of him always sitting there on the cushion. It is depressing.”Kieran McCarthy had his doubts about talking to The  because so many people have come to look around over the years, but have done nothing to help.Brigid McCarthy fears Spring Lane could become the next Carrickmines, where 10 Travellers lost their lives after an October 2015 fire. The Dublin tragedy is never far from her mind.“The caravans are really close to each other. If one went on fire they would all go on fire,” she says, adding that she would be happy to show Taoiseach Micheál Martin around Spring Lane to see for himself.“I would give him a good piece of my mind. I would like him to see how we live. Waking up every morning in the cold and the damp. It is hell. The kids are getting sick from the cold and the germs. It is something else.”Responding to questions, Cork City Council said it is committed to implementing the recommendations of the Ombudsman for Children and looks forward to working with all sides “to find and progress solutions”.In its contribution to the report, the local authority said many of the families would not consider any houses outside of their chosen areas, which did not have sufficient housing stock to meet this desire.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"dup meets to ratify election of edwin poots as new leader","story":"Incoming DUP leader Edwin Poots arriving to be ratified at the Ramada Hotel in Belfast: He takes over when  Arlene Foster steps down on Friday. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA The election of Edwin Poots as the new DUP leader has been formally ratified by the party’s Executive. The North’s Minister for Agriculture was confirmed as the party leader at a meeting on Thursday evening in Belfast of the party’s 130-strong Executive, which is made up of representatives from the party’s constituency associations as well as its Assembly members, MPs and members of the House of Lords. Mr Poots and the incoming deputy leader, Paula Bradley, were the last to arrive for the meeting at a south Belfast hotel, where they greeted well-wishers holding union flags before entering together. The BBC reported on Thursday night that a vote over whether to hold the ratification by secret ballot was defeated by 56 votes to 47, and Mr Poots was then ratified by 72 to 28 in a public vote. ResigningPaul Bell, an executive member of the DUP’s association in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said afterwards that he was resigning from the party because of the way the outgoing leader, Arlene Foster, had been treated. “The problem was with those number of MLAs and MPs that decided to go behind our back, to sign letters of confidence ... that is where the problem is. “It’s not the process of electing a new leader. It’s the fact that we’ve got 28 elected members in the Assembly and Westminster who would actually create a coup and publicly assassinate our leader,” he said. Mr Bell told the media the votes shed by the DUP at the next election would be in their “tens of thousands”, warning that “people in Fermanagh and South Tyrone will vote for anybody but the DUP.”The meeting revealed the extent of the isions within the DUP, with the outgoing leader Arlene Foster as well other senior figures including the MPs Jeffrey Donaldson, Gavin Robinson, Diane Dodds and Gregory Campbell leaving before Mr Poots made his inaugural speech as leader. Pretty brutalIn an interview with the BBC’s Newcast podcast on Thursday evening, Ms Foster said her removal as party leader had been “brutal” and questioned whether it should have been done in such a fashion. “Even by DUP standards it was pretty brutal, in terms of what happened,” the outgoing DUP leader said. “I had absolutely no idea and was telephoned by a close colleague that this was happening on Monday evening and then by Tuesday morning, it was all in the papers. “So, no, it wasn’t particularly pleasant. There was, of course, another way of doing it. But colleagues decided to go down a different route,” she said. On the Northern Ireland protocol, Ms Foster said that she was “really quite concerned” about the damage caused to the Belfast Agreement “moving into the summer months”. Libel victoryIn the podcast she reacted to her court victory on Thursday. The TV presenter Dr Christian Jessen was ordered to pay her damages of £125,000 for an “outrageous” defamatory tweet he posted which made unfounded claims that the First Minister was having an extramarital affair. She said it “turns out actually you can’t say what you like on Twitter and get away with it, and I think if the case today sends that message then I’m very happy about that.” Ms Foster said it was important that if abuse was coming from anonymous accounts “people can be challenged around it” and said fighting online trolls was “certainly part of what I want to do, not just for myself - because I’ll no longer be a public figure in that respect - but actually for ordinary young people and for women who find themselves attacked just because they’re different from how people want them to be. “I think that’s wrong. Look everybody’s entitled to their opinion, but what they’re not entitled to is to cause harm to people and I think that’s really important to say,” she said. Heal internal isionIn his speech to the DUP’s Executive immediately following his ratification as party leader, Mr Poots appealed for unionist unity and pledged to “rebuild, reunite and reinvigorate our party, unionism, and our great wee country.” He paid tribute to Ms Foster, saying he knew recent weeks had been “difficult for her”, but said that “no matter what background or place we come from, Arlene is and will be regarded as one of the most foremost women and unionists in British politics.” He also committed to continue the party’s campaign against the Northern Ireland protocol, saying that the party would “consistently roll back the objectional provisions of the protocol, as we have been doing. “That involves arguing our case forcefully and with conviction,” he said. “It involves making Brussels and Dublin aware that the protocol is intolerable and unworkable. “Legal challenges are one correct tactic, but the guaranteed way of reading our sales of the isive protocol is through the Assembly. “We will employ political tactics to continue the pressure, and let Dublin see that isn’t some hiccup, but rather something that has the worrying capacity to destabilise relationships that they have gained most from.”The new leader is expected to announce his ministerial team, including who will take on the role of first minister, next week. Also ratifiedMeanwhile, members of the Ulster Unionist Party met virtually on Thursday evening to ratify the Upper Bann Assembly member Doug Beattie as their new party leader. Mr Beattie was the only candidate to put his name forward for the leadership after the outgoing leader, Steve Aiken, stood down earlier this month. In a statement, the UUP chairman, Danny Kennedy, said the party had unanimously ratified Mr Beattie as the party leader, which took place “at the conclusion of a very positive meeting of the Ulster Unionist Council this evening”.

File photograph: GettySignificant shortfalls in the supply of vaccines are not expected to affect the new schedule for the reopening of social and economic life, to be announced today.While the undersupply of promised vaccines, including potentially a big reduction in the expected numbers of the single-dose Johnson \u0026amp Johnson shot, will hit the pace of the vaccination programme in June, Ministers are expected to press ahead with the plan for reopening at a Cabinet meeting today.However, the State’s public health team last night cleared the way for the expected easing of Covid-19 restrictions throughout the summer.In a letter to Government, the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) provided a broadly positive update and gave the green light for the return of indoor hospitality in restaurants and pubs from July 5th, the return of cinemas in June, indoor dining from July and the opening up of travel .It is now expected that international travel will return from July 19th with Ministers having discussed on Thursday evening operationalising the EU travel green cert from that date.France, Belgium and Luxembourg are also due to be taken off the list for mandatory hotel quarantine, it is understood.The team confirmed that, as planned, hotels could reopen on June 2nd and outdoor hospitality could reopen from June 7th.However, last night the Rstaurants Association of Ireland said it would be challenging the Government’s decision to reopen indoor dining in hotels on June 2nd ahead of restaurants, gastro pubs and cafes. It said the decision was “built on zero scientific or medical evidence” and it would be challenging the “statutory instrument” next week.From July, the numbers permitted at outdoor organised events can increase to a maximum of 100 attendees at the majority of venues, Nphet also recommended. For larger venues such as outdoor stadia or other “fixed” outdoor venues with a minimum capacity of 5,000 this could rise to 200.The number of guests at a wedding reception will rise to 50 people indoors in July, which will then increase to 100 in August, under the Nphet recommendations.Nphet is also understood to have recommended that up to 5,000 spectators can attend outdoor events in large stadia such as Croke Park from August 2nd, while smaller outdoor venues would have a limit of 500 people. Indoor events in larger venues could have a capacity of 200. Smaller indoor venues would be limited to 100 people, it is understood.The Cabinet will sign off today on the plan after the three party leaders are meeting this morning to finalise the measures discussed at last night’s Cabinet sub-committee.Ther was no disguising the disappointment in Government circles at the news that there were new shortfalls in vaccine supply on the horizon. A potential massive undersupply of the one-dose Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine will hit the vaccination programme especially hard.HSE chief executive Paul Reid said best-case scenario for deliveries of AstraZeneca in the coming weeks is half of what was expected, while the HSE does not know how many Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccines it will receive. Mr Reid said the number varies from a worst case of 64,000 to a best case of 235,000. So far, 60,000 doses have been received, most of which have been administered.Benefits of vaccinationSources said last night that despite the news of further shortfalls in vaccine delivery in June, this would not affect on the pace of the reopening to be announced today. Ministers acknowledged the impact on the vaccination programme but stressed the benefits of the vaccinations. Dr Colm Henry of the HSE told a weekly briefing that the number of deaths had “collapsed” due to the vaccines.Earlier, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar signalled that the reopening would proceed at pace when he told the Dáil: “The people have every reason to be hopeful about the summer ahead . . . We are ahead of ourselves in terms of where we thought we would be regarding hospitalisations and cases.“For that reason, we can look forward to a very positive announcement on Friday regarding the reopening of society and economy and the phased return to international travel, events, etc,” he said.About 2.6 million people have received a vaccine dose: 1.6 million first doses and 800,000 second doses. Between 304,000 and 314,000 people received a Covid-19 vaccine last week, and the target for this week is 260,000 to 280,000, Mr Reid said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news:  Indoor music events do not increase risk, Spanish trial suggestsBeijing critic and media tycoon Jimmy Lai sentenced to another 14 months behind barsGuilty verdicts: Did Dominic Cummings get it right on government Covid failures?Big-spending Joe Biden announces $6 trillion budget plan to boost US economyThe  weekly news quiz: Which journalist did Dominic Cummings have \u0026#39unauthorised\u0026#39 chats with?Friday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Mapped: The hotspots for the Indian variant of Covid-19 in the UKPrince Harry accuses media of \u0026#39weaponising\u0026#39 mental health Syria: President Assad wins 95pc of vote in election condemned by the WestDowning Street condemns Viktor Orban\u0026#39s \u0026#39Muslim invaders\u0026#39 comments ahead of meeting with Boris JohnsonWhat’s a £20m price tag when you’re crazy in love?

During an extraordinary seven-hour hearing in Parliament on Wednesday, the Prime Minister’s former chief adviser Dominic Cummings made a string of explosive claims about his numerous enemies in Downing Street.Many of these claims, however, are disputed. And given the seriousness of Cummings’s allegations, MPs will surely want to give each of his foes a right of reply.Roll on the next sensational hearing…Greg Clark MP: “Dilyn the Downing Street dog, thank you very much for agreeing to appear before the committee today. It’s been widely reported that, during Dominic Cummings’s time in No 10, the two of you had a working relationship that was less than harmonious. Is this the case?”Dilyn: “Thank you, Mr Chair. I’ll be absolutely frank here: the man was never fit for office. In fact, I repeatedly advised the Prime Minister to get rid of him.”Greg Clark: “And how did the Prime Minister respond?”Dilyn: “He wouldn’t listen. He just looked at me as if I was barking.”Greg Clark: “What was it about Mr Cummings that you objected to?”Dilyn: “He was just a nightmare to have around the place. Poorly behaved. Constantly getting under everyone’s feet. Always making a mess. Clearly hadn’t been house-trained. Quite frankly, I don’t know where they got him from.”Greg Clark: “When Mr Cummings appeared before this committee, he suggested that you were a hindrance to the work of Downing Street employees. According to him, Carrie Symonds ordered staff to spend their time rebutting negative coverage of you in the press, when they should have been dealing with far more important issues. Is this true?”Dilyn: “Look, all those stories about me were complete fabrications. Ever since I entered Downing Street, I have been the subject of a concerted smear campaign, clearly designed to undermine my position. And the press office had a duty to correct the record, so the public could see that these allegations about me were wholly unfounded.”Dilyn: “One, that the Prime Minister found me chewing a priceless antiquarian book at Chequers, and had to free it from my jaws. This is a total misrepresentation. In reality, I was simply bringing the book to the Prime Minister, because it was a classic treatise on the art of statesmanship, and I believed it contained valuable advice from which the PM could benefit. He accepted the book gratefully, and promised to add it to the top of his bedside reading pile.”Greg Clark: “But according to the account in the press, the Prime Minister shouted: ‘Someone please shoot that dog’.”Dilyn: “Again, this is an outrageous twisting of the truth. The Prime Minister meant ‘shoot’ as in ‘take photographs of’. He believed that publishing some charming pictures of his beloved pet would boost the public’s morale at a time of national crisis.”Greg Clark: “Who do you believe to have been the source of these briefings against you?”Dilyn: “There’s no doubt in my mind at all. From day one, it was obvious that Mr Cummings viewed me as a rival.”Dilyn: “He could see that I had the Prime Minister’s ear. Contrary to reports in the media, however, I was affectionately nibbling it – not biting. At no point did I draw blood.”Greg Clark: “You’ve made clear to this committee that you consider Mr Cummings to be an unreliable witness. Do you dispute his claim that, during a discussion in No 10 last year about whether to impose another lockdown, the Prime Minister said: ‘Let the bodies pile high’?”Dilyn: “Once again, this is an appalling misrepresentation. What the Prime Minister actually said was: ‘Let the Boddies pile high’ – as in, cans of Boddingtons Bitter. He was simply inviting everyone at the meeting to discuss the matter further over a few beers. It had been a long evening, and he wanted his advisers to let their hair down, enjoy a drink or two, and then resume the discussion. It was a perfectly innocent remark – and yet it’s been deliberately twisted to make the Prime Minister look bad.”Greg Clark: “Mr Cummings also told the committee that he quit Downing Street because the Prime Minister’s ‘girlfriend’, fiancée Carrie Symonds, was ‘trying to change a whole bunch of appointments at No 10’. According to him, she wished to ensure that those closest to her were given top jobs. Is this true?”Dilyn: “Absolute nonsense. The process by which I was offered the role of Downing Street press secretary was entirely above board. I declined purely because I wished to focus on other interests, such as chewing my tennis ball and chasing the squirrels in St James’s Park.”Greg Clark: “Dilyn the Downing Street dog, thank you very much for your time today. Have you anything further you wish to tell the committee?”Dilyn: “The problem in this crisis was that it was lions led by donkeys. Whereas the lions should obviously have been led by dogs.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"can take mask now confusion reigns vaccinated americans","story":"This first appeared in the Letter from the USA newsletter. Sign up for expert insight and exclusive analysis on American politics, written every Thursday here.A few days ago I went to my local supermarket in a suburb of Washington.There was a sign on the door saying that, on the advice of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, masks are no longer required inside if you\u0027re fully vaccinated.More than half of adults in America, including myself, are now completely jabbed up.So I was surprised to discover that I was the only person in the store not wearing a mask.I\u0027ve since been to two more shops, including a monster-sized outlet called Target. Both of those stores, also on the advice of the CDC, do not require masks to be worn.Yet, on each occasion, everyone I saw inside - customers and staff - was still wearing them.On my way out of one shop I overheard two men talking about having had no ill effects after their second jabs. Yet they were both still wearing masks. In the car park.So what\u0027s going on here? Well, it appears a significant number of fully vaccinated Americans are needlessly wearing soggy cloths on their faces weeks after their own government told them they don\u0027t have to.On May 13, in a blaze of publicity, the CDC announced masks were no longer needed, indoors or out, if you are fully vaccinated.Today is a great day for America,” Joe Biden declared in the White House Rose Garden, removing his own face covering. If you are fully vaccinated, you no longer need to wear a mask.Dr Rochelle Walensky, the CDC Director, said: We have all longed for this moment.Apparently, some were longing for it more than others.Far be it from me to suggest that my fellow vaccinated shoppers take their masks off. If someone wants to carry on wearing one until 2030 just in case that’s their right.But it just seems bonkers. When the foremost experts and the President have told you Hey, it’s OK to take it off now then why wouldn’t you?Maybe the message is taking time to get through. Although given the publicity that seems unlikely.Perhaps it’s just inertia, that mask wearing has become a habit. People have also been scared, and might just want to be doubly sure the pandemic really is over.Or, maybe they want to show solidarity with those who aren’t vaccinated. But if that’s the case it doesn’t make sense.If you want to encourage others to get jabbed, the best thing would be to remove your mask in the supermarket aisle, jump up and down on it, and shout Look at me. I\u0027ve been vaccinated. I\u0027m free.As America\u0027s most trusted coronavirus expert Dr Anthony Fauci explained, the CDC\u0027s decision to lift mask requirements for vaccinated people was fully intended to serve as an incentive for those who have been reluctant to get the vaccine.There is another possibility. The question of whether vaccinated people can still spread the virus at a low level is not definitively answered, and some Americans may be cautious about that.But the CDC has concluded it is safe for vaccinated people to roam around stores maskless. And the CDC knows what the risk is better than those who shop at Target.It is worth noting that mask wearing has always varied widely across America.At the height of the pandemic I went into a supermarket in the southern state of Georgia. All the people I could see were not wearing masks.Now, as the crisis moves towards its conclusion, the opposite is true in and around Washington - people are inexplicably refusing to ditch them.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dealings switzerland eu proving us right leaving","story":"Was the UK government a difficult customer when it came to negotiating a trade deal with the EU? No doubt Michel Barnier would want us to believe so - with his complaints about cherry-picking and wanting our cake and eating it. But the collapse of trade talks between the EU and Switzerland tells a different story.  Switzerland, which once filed an application to join the EU but never went along with it, has rubbed along for years quite happily on the back of a wad of bilateral trade agreements with the bloc – around 120 of them. Through those agreements it has functioned as a member of the single market, though remains outside the EU customs union - which allows it to do its own trade deals with third countries. For the Swiss it is a best-of-both-worlds arrangement - a model which was at one time touted as a possible blueprint for Britain’s post-Brexit relationship with the EU, although dismissed by the May government as it would have meant Britain remaining under the jurisdiction of the EU Court of Justice.  But this happy arrangement is about to be phased out - thanks to the EU trying to muscle its way into Swiss affairs in a way the Swiss found unacceptable. It started with the EU, eight years ago, wanting to roll those 120 bilateral trade agreements into one. It was a reasonable ambition you might think - a tidying-up exercise, a rationalisation which would make the rules easier for everyone to understand.But, needless to say, that wasn’t just what the EU had in mind. It wanted to seize the opportunity to extend its free movement rules to Switzerland and more effectively to impose its regulations on the country. In future, Switzerland was to be forced into ‘dynamic alignment’ with EU regulations. In other words, the EU would lay down the rules that it expected Switzerland to follow, on environmental law, labour law and everything else. Moreover, it expected Switzerland to bend to its social security rules, which, so the Swiss feared, would have meant EU citizens being able to settle in Switzerland and gain full access to its welfare system from day one.This was one of the main points on which David Cameron’s ill-fated attempt to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU in 2015 failed. The EU refused to adjust its rules, even though they made it very difficult and expensive for a country, like Britain, with a universal benefits system to obey. When, say, a citizen of a relatively poor country like Romania can turn up and be eligible, from day one, for the same social benefits as a British citizen who has been working and paying taxes here for 40 years, it is asking for trouble.Not unreasonably, the Swiss, too, have decided that they won’t accept the EU trying to demand full access to its social security system and to deny the country the ability to make its own laws. It has withdrawn from the trade talks. That doesn’t mean Switzerland will fall into a ‘no deal’ situation as the 120 bilateral agreements will remain in place, but one by one they risk becoming obsolete as the EU ups its regulation and freezes out Swiss competition.There is a very clear conclusion to draw from the episode: trade arrangements which the EU found perfectly acceptable 20, 30, 40 years ago it no longer finds acceptable. The EU no longer simply wants free trade: it wants to muscle its way into many more aspects of its neighbours’ economic and social lives. Either you are a member of the EU, it is asserted, or we will try all we can to force you to become a de facto member.In taking this attitude, the EU is threatening free trade altogether. It is much easier to do a free trade deal if you are not trying to poke your nose into every aspect of the other country’s affairs. Remainers told us that we would never have the might to do trade deals on our own – we needed to be part of the EU.Yet the Swiss episode - eight years of negotiations for nothing - tells us something quite different. Over the coming years a nimbler, less-demanding Britain has the opportunity to open up trade with the rest of the world much more successfully than has the EU. Indeed, with its growing protectionism and arrogance, the EU risks going backwards.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"duke duchess cambridges royal tour scotland pictures","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been captivating the Scottish people on a Royal tour this week.From getting green-fingered in Starbank Park, Edinburgh to racing land yachting vehicles on the beach at St Andrews - and even playing a spot of tennis, the couple have continued to rise to the challenge. Click for the best pictures from their jam-packed week, which we\u0027ll be updating as they go. Beijing critic and media tycoon Jimmy Lai sentenced to another 14 months behind barsCoronavirus latest news:  Indoor music events do not increase risk, Spanish trial suggestsGuilty verdicts: Did Dominic Cummings get it right on government Covid failures?Big-spending Joe Biden announces $6 trillion budget plan to boost US economyThe  weekly news quiz: Which journalist did Dominic Cummings have \u0026#39unauthorised\u0026#39 chats with?Friday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Mapped: The hotspots for the Indian variant of Covid-19 in the UKPrince Harry accuses media of \u0026#39weaponising\u0026#39 mental health Syria: President Assad wins 95pc of vote in election condemned by the WestDowning Street condemns Viktor Orban\u0026#39s \u0026#39Muslim invaders\u0026#39 comments ahead of meeting with Boris JohnsonWhat’s a £20m price tag when you’re crazy in love?

The erroneously published content included definitions and examples of behaviours that might be reportable.”He said that “some of those definitions and examples went beyond the policies discussed and agreed by colleagues” in the run-up to the website’s launch, adding: “That material should not have been there, and its publication was a mistake.”The vice-chancellor insisted that he “unambiguously” wants to “bolster the university’s reputation for enquiry and vigorous debate”.Prof Toope went on to say that Cambridge is “rightly known for offering people the space to think and to challenge conventions”.He said that the “mis-step” created the impression that the university might be “unduly” constraining freedom of expression.Dons described the personal letter from the vice-chancellor as a surprising development, with one adding: “It is unusual to have such a long email on one topic that in fact concedes the cock-up”.Another academic said: “It is obviously pretty embarrassing that the university has been planning this major new policy for over a year and they have had to do a U-turn within a week of it being launched.“It raises questions about how anything like this could have come within a mile of being approved by senior people at the university and published on their website.”He said it is “hard to believe” the material was published by mistake, “given how much work went into it”.Dr Arif Ahmed, a lecturer in philosophy at Gonville and Caius welcomed the vice-chancellor’s climb down, but said it is important to “get to the bottom” of what happened.“I think anything that involves anonymous reporting that is used for anything other than statistical process is so clearly contrary to ordinary rules of process,” he said.Dr James Orr of Cambridge’s Divinity Faculty said: “The vice-chancellor should be commended for doing the right thing.“But until the university\u0027s managers recognise that the free expression of many reasonable and plainly lawful beliefs can always be subjectively - and therefore unverifiably - construed as causing psychological harm, these sorts of crises will continue to occur.”The website had been created as part of a “Change the Culture” initiative that includes a series of policies and resources aimed at “clarifying expectations” about behaviour.A list of examples of micro-aggressions was provided on the website, including asking someone “where are you really from?” and misgendering a person, especially if they have already shared their pronouns.   This is the second free speech victory Cambridge dons have claimed in the past six months.On Thursday, Cambridge re-published its Report and Support website but the list of “micro-aggressions” had been taken down, as had its definition of racism. The website says that students and staff can make “named reports” about inappropriate behaviour of others but explained that the anonymous reporting option is now under review. It explained that a working group has been convened to decide on the future of this aspect of the site. In December, academics prevailed after voting down an attempt by university chiefs to force them to be “respectful of the erse identities of others”.Three amendments, put forward by academics who said they wanted to safeguard free speech at the 800-year-old university, were voted through, leading the rebel dons to claim they had “won by a landslide”.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"left rabid dog life like ordinary belarusians trapped country","story":"Europe and Britain have moved to ban flights to and from Belarus to punish Alexander Lukashenko for effectively hijacking a Ryanair flight in order to arrest a dissident journalist. But many Belarusians who oppose Mr Lukashenko and have suffered under his rule fear they are about to become even more isolated. Maxim, a 33-year-old artist currently living at an artists residence in Vienna, was due to fly back home to Minsk next month but now is not sure how he would get back.“Minsk airport used to be the only way to get out of the country,” said Maxim, a 33-year old artist who was meant to fly back to Minsk after completing a residency in Vienna next month. “The EU ban for Belavia is a direct blow against ordinary people and civil society. They have isolated and left us with a rabid dog,” he said, referring to the president of 26 years. The regime doesn’t give a damn about Belavia because they have been slapped with visa bans as it is.”In a list of sanctions announced on Tuesday, the European Council called on member states to close their airspace and airports to Belarusian carriers, and stop their own airlines from flying to or over Belarus. Latvia and Poland (along with non-EU members Britain and Ukraine) have already banned their own airlines from flying to and from Belarus, resulting in cancelled flights to Warsaw and Riga. The measures have been welcomed by Belarusian opposition leaders including Svetlana Tsikhanouskaya, the exiled former presidential  candidate who many Belarusians believe was the legitimate winner of August\u0027s election. Speaking to the European Parliament on Thursday, she urged MEPs to stick to the proposed sanctions and not be tempted to return to a softly-softly policy. “The EU approach of gradually elevating pressure on the Lukashenko regime hasn\u0027t managed to change its behaviour and only led to a growing sense of impunity and massive repressions,“ she said. But many ordinary Belarusians, including those sympathetic to the opposition, have expressed dismay. The Belarusian government imposed stiff restrictions on crossing the country’s land borders citing fears of Covid-19 that Mr Lukashenko otherwise routinely dismisses as insignificant, making it almost impossible to drive or take the train into neighbouring Poland and Lithuania. And the recent arrests of several Belarusian dissidents in Russia, which has a visa free regime with Belarus and has previously served as an escape route for opponents of Mr Lukashenko, has also left many wary of travelling via Moscow. Many fleeing Mr Lukashenko’s brutal crackdown on the opposition have in recent months taken the short flight to Warsaw or Vilnius instead, and they now fear that door closing.“People on both sides of the border found themselves in a cage,” said Volha Neskladovskaya-Tereshkova, 28, who moved to Poland with her family in March.Everyone opposed to the Lukashenko regime “has been waiting for harsh sanctions for so long: But now that it happened, the sanctions are not really against the regime but against ordinary people,” she said. Ms Neskladovskaya-Tereshkova is typical of thousands of opposition-leaning Belarusians who have sought refuge in Europe following the terrifying and indiscriminate crackdown Mr Lukashenko unleashed after a disputed elections in August. Her husband, an IT specialist, was grabbed by riot police at an election-night protest and was repeatedly beaten and humiliated in custody before he was released three days later. Investigators declined to open a criminal probe when he complained about the beatings. The couple and their toddler left the country when secured a Polish work visa. Now, she says, she has no idea when she will next see her parents. She’s also not sure what to do about the family corgi, which is still in Minsk and which her brother was meant to bring to Warsaw in the coming weeks. “We’d probably have to do it via Russia but it’s not easy flying with a dog.”“It feels like a trap.  Land borders are closed and now planes won’t fly. In the past, if you were in danger, you could relocate to Poland or Lithuania, and the flights were cheap, fast and open to us, said  Marina Sokolova, a 46-year old freelance journalist in Minsk. Nonetheless, she insisted she could see the point of the sanctions and said she could bear them - provided all these steps contribute to change in Belarus.I’m a journalist and many of my friends are now in prison and what are our inconveniences caused by the ban in comparison to their suffering in prison. It is a double edged sword. We are trapped but we understand that this is one step to our freedom,” she said.  The anger is also spilling onto social media, with many wondering how isolation will harm the regime. Talks around passenger flights tofrom Belarus are a celebration of human indifference, Andrey Vozyanov, a Minsk based musician, wrote on Facebook. Belarusians whom I know had long feared of being sealed off, but few expected it coming from outside.European diplomats are certainly aware of the issue. German officials raised the possible impact on members of the Belarusian opposition trying to get out of the country during the talks that led up to Tuesday\u0027s statement on sanctions. And a French proposal to sever all land transportation links with Belarus was shot down by other nations who considered it too drastic and likely to hurt ordinary people. The full closure of EU airports to Belavia, the national carrier most Belarusian travellers rely on, will only come into effect after ministers and bureaucrats hammer out the legal details, which could take weeks. Minsk airport continued to schedule Belavia flights to and from EU destinations including  Amsterdam, Milan, Tallin, Vienna and Warsaw remained scheduled on Wednesday and Thursday. Flights will continue to Russia and most other former Soviet states remain unaffected, as well as major non-European hubs including Istanbul. Belavia currently flies non-stop from London Gatwick to Minsk three times weekly on an Embraer 195. A total of 13 flights from London to Minsk (one way) are scheduled to depart in June 2021, according to Cirium, a company that collates aviation industry data. Andrei Sannikov, a former presidential candidate and opposition leader who fled Belarus after being beaten and jailed in 2011, said concerns about the consequences for ordinary people were legitimate. But he argued that the measures were necessary and marked a long overdue recognition that more than two decades of trying to engage with Mr Lukashenko\u0027s regime had failed. “Yes I am worried about the impact on ordinary people, but I have not heard anyone really complaining about it so far. When I speak to people, they generally say they are willing to endure a little pain if they can finally get rid of this psychopath,” he said by telephone from Warsaw, where he now lives. The main thing is that Europe has finally realised Lukashenko is a threat to everyone. They previously tried to treat Belarus as a humanitarian issue, not as a security issue, and that did not work, he said. Ms Neskladovskaya is not so sure. “Europe wants to ensure safety for its own citizens: but who’s going to ensure our safety? she said. People got shut out and they have no idea how to get out of the country if they need to.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt hancock backbenchers flock health secretarys aid spartacus","story":"On Wednesday, Dominic Cummings described his work-day from hell: Covid cases surging, emergency COBRA meetings derailed by begging requests to join Trump’s bombing campaign of Iraq – and most shocking of all - Number 10’s media operation going into meltdown over the reputation of a Jack Russell.Most of us would be hard-pushed to imagine so awful a day – but then again, most of us aren’t Matt Hancock. Given the epic monstering he endured at Cummings’s hands on Wednesday, it was almost a surprise to see him still standing in the Commons, bloodied but unbowed.Caught in the crosshairs, he attempted a Churchillian call to arms – though this being Matt, it was overlaid with trademark Hancockian schmaltz. He heaped praise on Our NHS and warmly thanked the “volunteers who stood in cold car parks with a smile”.“We have come together, and we have overcome!”, he finished, flopping back dramatically on the green benches.Jonathan Ashworth, Hancock’s mild-mannered opposite number, usually seems a bit too polite for the Westminster swamp. Today, even he came out keen to slash and burn – though with his cherubic features and reedy voice, the effect was underwhelming, like watching your pet hamster attempting a powerplay to commandeer the seedbox.“Is he ashamed that he promised a protective shield around care homes, and over 30,000 care home residents have died?”, piped Ashworth solemnly.The Health Secretary looked cowed. Any minute now his bottom lip was going to wobble. But suddenly reinforcements arrived in the reassuring form of Jeremy Hunt – former health secretary, select committee chair and classic Head Boy material. Like a protective older brother, he defended poor Matt from the sixth-form bully who’d stolen his dinner money and spread nasty stories about him in the locker-room.The Tory faithful whinnied approvingly, but it was not over yet.Martyn Day of the SNP demanded a full and immediate public inquiry, Yasmin Qureshi asked about corporate manslaughter and Munira Wilson doubled down on care home deaths. Legions of opposition MPs surrounded the Health Secretary, drawn to the Cummings standard.Then, following Jeremy Hunt’s lead, the Tory backbenchers linked arms and formed a defensive phalanx around him. One by one, they stood up, in a blue-rosetted version of Spartacus, demonstrating their solidarity in ever-more sycophantic ways.“When it comes to the Health Secretary, I’m a fan”, said Mark Logan, quoting an approving constituent and plugging an article he had written in the Secretary of State\u0027s defence.“Yeahyeahyeah!” snarled the Tory combatants.Much of the love-bombing emanated from the West Country. Selaine Saxby thanked him for visiting North Devon district hospital and condemned the ‘flip-flopping’ opposition. Cherilyn Mackrory went one further, not just celebrating his trip to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro but posing a hardball question: “Can my right honourable friend assure me that he will ignore unsubstantiated Westminster gossip, and stay focused on delivering the vaccination rollout?”“I’m Matt Hancock!” “I’m Matt Hancock!” they cried.It resembled siege warfare. The Opposition trebuchet would lob a few Cummings projectiles at the keep. Meanwhile Matt or one of his backbenchers would retaliate with missiles of their own, usually praise for the vaccination rollout, or use of the word ’unprecedented’, which was deployed in unprecedented quantities, even for these unprecedented times.The congenial back-slapping atmosphere occasionally intensified into heavy-petting, but Matt swelled and his confidence blossomed.At the evening press conference later, the transparency-loving Health Secretary swerved queries about care home deaths with a familiar tactic repeating the same waffling platitudes until it was time for the next question.“Every day we are unwavering in our focus to protect life”, he trilled, on auto-pilot, using phrases only a character in a Steven Spielberg film – or a Minister who knows he’s lived to fight another day – would be bold enough to articulate.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"might soon live 150 good thing","story":"“Immortality dashed,” announced the headline in this newspaper, “but humans could live to be 150.” It says something about the unrealistic expectations of the modern human that living for one and a half centuries should be presented as something of an anti-climax.For years now there have been rumours that scientists, funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, were on the brink of solving death altogether. But a large-scale study of elderly volunteers in America and the UK has concluded that even the best-maintained body is doomed to “progressive functional decline”. Our biological resilience cannot extend beyond 120-150 years: “the absolute limit of the human life”.Still – 150 years. That sounds good to me. Enough time to really get stuck in, but with a distant deadline to concentrate the mind. Like doing a PhD in life, instead of bluffing your way through the GCSE.Although the average global life has already more than doubled – from 47 in 1950, to 73 today – it’s still a struggle to fit everything in. In fact, living longer has made us more slow-moving, particularly when it comes to the big decisions: leaving the parental home, finding a long-term mate, becoming parents ourselves.I was 36 when I had the first of my three children, almost 14 years ago. If I were a global statistic from 1950, I’d be dead already. As it is, I sometimes find myself staring at the ceiling in the insomniac hours, calculating all the things I may miss out on because of this late start.If my children reproduce as sluggishly as me, and if I die in my seventies, like my father, I may never get to meet any of my grandchildren.It’s not the babies per se that I feel sad about it’s the thought that I won’t be able to accompany my children on this part of their adventure.There are, it must be admitted, obvious drawbacks to extending our lifes. The chances are we wouldn’t get much in the way of extra youth. By far the bulk of our additional years would be spent in a condition of extreme senectitude. What’s the point of meeting your descendants if you can only wave at them wanly from your pickling vat?It would be awful for the planet, too. John K Davis, an American philosophy professor, has run demographic models to see what extending our lives to 150 would do to the world. His research found that, even if the birth rate was limited to two children per woman, the global population would reach 21 billion by the end of this century: 10 billion more than currently projected. Mass famine, on the heels of climate disaster, would surely follow.For the sake of our grandchildren, then, we should not strive to meet them. But how can we resist? Life really does feel so short as it is.American pharmacists are reporting a surge in sales of teeth-whitener, as the country prepares to relax its guidance on mask-wearing. Make-up, party clothes, deodorant and hair-removal cream are also booming.What a bore! The one enjoyable aspect of this pandemic has been allowing myself to go entirely to seed. I haven’t worn make-up, put on high heels or even weighed myself for over a year. My body is so hairy I hardly need clothes to stay warm.I could happily stay like this – fat, furry and comfortable – forever.

The poll has it well short of a majority, and all the other parties have ruled out going into coalition with it.Instead a rival coalition is likely form around the CDU in order to keep the far-Right party out of power.Reiner Haseloff, the regional CDU leader, has made it clear any form of cooperation with the AfD is a “red line” the party will not cross.“The AfD has no coalition partners, and cannot govern without them and against the CDU,” Hermann Binkert, the head of Insa, said.There was good news for the Green Party, which is set to more than double its vote from 2016 in Saxony-Anhalt, according to the Insa poll, which had it in fourth place on 11 per cent.The party has traditionally struggled in the former communist east, and a good result would be seen as evidence it can now compete in every region of Germany. The Greens briefly led the national polls this month, but they have slipped back to second, on 22 per cent behind the CDU on 26 percent.The AfD is currently in fifth place nationally on 11 per cent, short of the 12.5 per cent the party won in 2017’s general election.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"friday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"Matt Hancock faced mounting political pressure on Thursday night after he admitted he had allowed people to be discharged from hospital into care homes without being tested for Covid.The Heath Secretary insisted he had not promised Cabinet colleagues that everyone who made the switch would be tested, only that tests would be done once there was capacity. Read the full story.When the coronavirus pandemic first emerged in Wuhan in December 2019, conspiracy theorists quickly pointed out that it was close to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a leading world centre for research on coronaviruses. Of all the labs in all the cities in all the world, a deadly coronavirus had emerged at the spot where scientists were believed to be creating deadly coronaviruses. Read the full story.Traffic lights will automatically be set to red for motorists to prioritise pedestrians under a scheme being rolled out by Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London.Transport for London (TfL) announced on Thursday that pedestrian crossings would be left on the green man setting to make the capital more “walkable”. Read the full story.She promised she would wear a pink dress and on Thursday, the Duchess of Cambridge gamely kept to her word.To the clear delight of five-year-old Mila Sneddon, the Duchess looked like a “real princess” as they finally met a year after her portrait was chosen as a finalist in her Hold Still lockdown photography exhibition. Read the full story.Cambridge’s vice-chancellor has moved to quell a free speech revolt by issuing a statement to academics saying the university’s publication of a “micro-aggressions” list was a mistake.Prof Stephen Toope wrote to the entire staff body to explain that aspects of its new reporting website - which was launched last week but then taken offline days later following its exposure in The  - had been included “in error”. Read the full story.Stay up-to-date with breaking news and the latest politics from The  throughout the day.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"couple terrified glass tv stand","story":"NewsCouple terried as glass TV stand shatters during night and nearly kills their dogDaniel Halawi and Rachael Fisher, of Romford, Essex, were awoken by a loud bang in the night and found their TV stand had broken, almost injuring their Chihuahua CocomirrorShareCommentsByAdam BarnettMatthew DreschEmma James:,  MAY NewsAn Essex couple woke up to find their TV stand had collapsed, nearly injuring their pet Chihuahua \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

After almost every sporting event black players are subject to a torrent of racist abuse online. The vile trolls were out in force again on Wednesday night, targeting their hatred towards Marcus Rashford following Manchester United’s defeat to Villareal. The time for excuses is over. When this paper asked Twitter about its policies on tackling hatred it claimed “abuse and harassment have no place on our service”. Why then are black sportsmen and pundits such as Rashford, Thierry Henry and Ian Wright still receiving such horric messages  The social media firms could act now. The fact they don’t shows how seriously they really take this issue. Bank on sun For once the weather gods are being kind. Not only is it a Bank Holiday, the forecast is for sunshine.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeMatt Hancock appears to have given inaccurate vaccine data to the House of Commons, immediately after promising heaposs always been straight with the public. The Health Secretary made the unfortunate exaggeration in Parliament, where minutes earlier he had denied claims from Dominic Cummings that he lied on multiple occasions.He told Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi, whose town of Bolton has been badly hit by the Indian Covid iant: The number of vaccinations happening in Bolton right now is phenomenal, tens of thousands every single day.And it is heartening to see the queues of people coming forward. While the number of jabs in Bolton has indeed soared - roughly quadrupling since the start of May - it is still nowhere near tens of thousands per day in a town of ,. Government data shows that in the last week, the -day rolling average was around a peak of , first doses and , per day, a total of , to , per day. There have been some successful single days, but at , first doses on May  and , second doses on May . Bolton South East MP Ms Qureshi had asked when the Prime Minister and others would be investigated by the police for alleged corporate manslaughter  She spoke after ex-No aide Mr Cummings said tens of thousands of people died who did not need to die in the UK Covid pandemic. She told the Commons: Last week my constituents were wrongly accused of vaccine hesitancy and then we had a quasi-lockdown that no-one knew about and many peopleaposs travel plans were thrown in chaos. My constituents can forgive the Government for that, but I am sure that I speak for the country when I say that we cannot forgive tens of thousands of people who died and didnapost need to die - the chilling words of Dominic Cummings. Will the Secretary of State tell me, when will the Prime Minister and others be investigated by the police for alleged corporate manslaughter and why did we not follow the example of New Zealand where they managed to control it with a minimum number of deaths  Health Secretary Matt Hancock replied: No, but what I would say to the people of Bolton is that - the people of Bolton have again risen to this challenge. Asked about the discrepancy, Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman said: The data for vaccination rates in Bolton and other areas is published on our dashboard very clearly. And it is right that Bolton is well above the average numbers of vaccinations being carried out daily, which is a testament to the work by the local NHS and the public in Bolton. AskedMr Hancock had misled MPs, the spokesman replied: I haven’t seen the Health Secretary’s comment. What I would point you to is the data published on the dashboard. It does highlight the huge numbers of vaccinations that are being carried out in Bolton. That’s a real success of the surge vaccination programme introduced by the Department of Health and Social Care. Earlier Mr Hancock denied explosive allegations from Dominic Cummings - insisting: Iaposve been straight with people - but did not go into details about his claims.The PMaposs former aide said Mr Hancock should have been sacked on  to  occasions in a bombshell evidence session before MPs on Wednesday. He accused Mr Hancock of lying in meetings and in public, as well as interfering in the rollout of the Test and Trace scheme to meet a stupid testing target. In one of his most serious allegations, Mr Cummings also blamed Mr Hancock for the failure to test patients ing to care homes in the early stages of the pandemic. He said Mr Hancock had insisted people were being tested before going into care homes, only for the PM to find out weeks later that they were not. Mr Hancock told MPs: These... are serious allegations and I welcome the opportunity to come to the House to put formally on the record that these unsubstantiated allegations around honesty are not true. Iaposve been straight with people in public and in private throughout.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNHSHouse of CommonsBoris JohnsonCare homesNursing homesPolitics"},{"url":null,"title":"rishi sunak denies david cameron","story":"NewsRishi Sunak denies David Cameron got special attention as row erupts over lost textsTop treasury official Sir Tom Scholar refused to allow texts he sent to the David Cameron to be handed over to the Treasury Select Committee, which scrutinises the work of Mr Sunak’s departmentmirrorShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video mps-question-rishi-sunak-over-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:pNntqcqz,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

The Chancellor claimed his department’s contact with the former PM did “not occupy a lot of our overall time”, and that “it was important to look at this regardless of who was raising it with us.” MPs were left gobsmacked as Mr Sunak complained that having to declare details of lobbyists’ contact with officials might mean firms are less likely to engage with government. And a fresh row emerged over the publication of texts from a top Treasury official to former PM David Cameron as he lobbied officials on behalf of a doomed lender. Top treasury official Sir Tom Scholar refused to allow texts he sent to the David Cameron to be handed over to the Treasury Select Committee, which scrutinises the work of Mr Sunak’s department. Mr Cameron contacted Sir Tom, pleading in vain for the Government to prop up financier Greensill Capital as the Covid- pandemic took hold. Mr Cameron released his side of the chummy conversation - which he signed off Love DC. But the Treasury said Sir Tomaposs replies had been wiped, after his password was entered incorrectly on his official phone. In one of Mr Cameron’s messages to Sir Tom on March , the former PM appeared to predict a Bank of England interest rate cut five days before it was announced.  Mr Cameron wrote: “Never quite understood how rate cuts help a pandemic. Officials are legally barred from disclosing market sensitive information about changes to interest rates. Mr Cameron claimed he had been talking about an already announced VAT rate cut. And speaking to the Committee today, Sir Tom said he could not remember the subject of the discussion, but suggested it might have been to do with an emergency rate cut in the United States. But askedhe would allow Mr Cameron to provide his copy of his messages to the Committee, he refused - saying any release of the information should be controlled by the Treasury through Freedom of Information disclosures. Such disclosure could take weeks, and would allow the Treasury to redact the messages before they were released to the public. The messages that we were talking about were generated by me in on an official government device in the course of official government business, Sir Tom said. And I think itaposs appropriate that that be treated like any other part of official government business, and disclosure would have been governed through the Freedom of Information act. Sir Tom told the Committee his phone gets accidentally wiped about once a year, adding: It tends to happen after the password has been changed, which youaposre required to do at regular intervals. Both Treasury officials and Mr Sunak claimed Mr Cameron’s lobbying had been unsuccessful, and had not taken up much time. Charles Roxburgh, second permanent secretary to the Treasury, defended the Treasury’s nine meetings with the firm’s representatives. He told the Committee Mr Sunak “did not spend a lot of time on this, and I did not spend a lot of time on this, because I too was working on a lot more time-consuming and intense situations at the time, Mr Roxburgh met several times with Greensill at a time when the Government was scrambling to respond to the Covid- pandemic. After a few meetings the Treasury declined Greensillaposs attempts to be part of the Bank of Englandaposs Covid Corporate Financing Facilityscheme. Mr Sunak claimed increasing transparency on Government lobbying would make firms “reluctant” to engage with ministers, which he said would be “disappointing and damaging to the policymaking process. “If they feel that every communication with government is available to the public, they might be reluctant to engage,” he said.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnDavid CameronThe TreasuryBank of EnglandBanksCivil servantsInterest ratesPolitics"},{"url":null,"title":"uk covid infections highest 6","story":"NewsUK Covid infections at highest for  weeks with up to % caused by Indian iantEarlier on Thursday Health Secretary Matt Hancock said around one in  people in hospital with Covid- in current \"hotspots\" have had both vaccines, but the vast majority have not which \"gives us a high degree of confidence that the vaccine is highly effective.\"mirrorShareCommentsByJane KirbyMilo BoydReporterDan Bloom:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video matt-hancock-more-half-big-,customFields:,clearance:Network,source:bcdccbccd,sourceUrl:sky news,site:Mirror,brandSafety: Sport and specialist news – passed for ad targeting,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:teYcYkZh,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Matt Hancock announced this afternoon that the Indian iant was still spreading, with between half and three quarters of new cases now the mutant strain.The rising figures were reported the day after the Health Secretary told MPs that on Wednesday there were , new cases of coronavirus, which is the highest since April .While this is unwelcome news, a graph of coronavirus cases shown during the briefing exposes only a slight recent rise in daily cases. Moreover, Hancock yesterday said that the link between Covid- cases, hospital admissions and deaths is being severed, in large part due to the vaccination programme. On May  there were  people in hospital with Covid, while there were around , admissions every day in January.  The Health Secretary told MPs this pandemic isnapost over yet, adding: Our vaccination programme has reached  per cent of the adult population, but that means that more than a quarter still havenapost been jabbed...  per cent of adults have had both jabs, but that means that more than half are yet to get the fullest possible protection that two jabs gives. Yesterday we saw , new cases of coronavirus, the highest since April , but thanks to the power of vaccination, in which I have always believed, the link from cases to hospitalisations and to deaths is being severed. It was reported yesterday that the iant - B... - was detected in  local authorities in the week ending  May. That is an  per cent weekly increase, according to figures from the Wellcome Sanger Institute which sequences a random sample of positive tests in the community. Scientists do not believe the Indian iant is more deadly or renders the vaccine less effective. However, government advisory body SAGE believes there is a realistic possibility transmissibility could be  per cent higher.  The latest data come after Professor Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, whose modelling was instrumental to the UK locking down in March , said the Indian iant was now the dominant strain in the UK and the full reopening of society on June  hangs in the balance.Asked in the Commons by former health secretary Jeremy Hunt what measures could be taken to ensure June  - when all legal limits on social contact are due to be lted - could go ahead, Mr Hancock said: It is true that the Indian iant is spreading across the country, and estimates y as to what proportion of the new cases each day are the iant first identied in India, which is more transmissible. Now my assessment is that it is too early now to say, yet, whether we can take the full step four on June . Like him, I desperately want us to, but we will only do thatitaposs safe. We will make a formal assessment ahead of June  as to what step we can take onthe st, and in that we will be both driven by the data, we will be advised on and guided by the science, and we will be fully transparent both with this House and with the public in those decisions.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnImperial CollegeJeremy HuntHospitalsCoronavirusMatthew Hancock MP"},{"url":null,"title":"brits bake bank holiday weekend","story":"NewsBrits to bake as Bank Holiday weekend heatwave begins with temperatures up to CAfter weeks of sodden weather forecasters are now predicting the start of a long-awaited heatwave from todaymirrorShareCommentsByWilliam WalkerNews Reporter:,  MAY NewsThe better weather is in time for the last May Bank Holiday of the year \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Its ­red-brick buildings are haunted by its brutal past as an experiment in Margaret Thatcher’s “short, sharp shock”. For decades, the facility for young, first-time offenders, was the scene of brutal, sadistic detention, where  to -year-olds were sexually and physically abused – for which members of staff were eventually convicted. Now, Home Secretary Priti Patel has a new plan for the abandoned buildings near Consett, County Durham. A “prison-style” detention and “removal centre” for up to  women seeking asylum. The news comes as a blow to Medomsley’s survivors who want to see the buildings torn down. It is also a betrayal of refugee campaigners promised a new approach to women’s detention, at a time when concerns are growing over Home Office failures at Napier and Penally Barracks. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  Medomsley survivor David ‘Alan’ Brown says he was sent there in  aged  for a petty crime he didn’t commit. Now a -year-old grandad, he waived his anonymity in  to give evidence against his abusers. This week, we introduced Alan to Agnes Tanoh, a refugee who is campaigning against the centre. “It is a shock, because in my opinion that place needs to be knocked down,” Alan told Agnes. “There are too many bad memories in that bad place. When I drive past or see or hear the word Medomsley, it makes me feel ill. I want to drive a crane with a big ball on the end and smash it to bits.” He shares his memories, which include being “kicked to bits” in a padded cell, “hearing bones crunch” during beatings handed out to other boys, and one boy asking him to stamp on his leg to break it, to escape a brutal PT session. Agnes, who once worked for the Ivorian MP Simone Gbagbo, we of the former president, narrowly escaped the Ivory Coast with her le in . A year earlier she was among those locked up with Mr and Mrs Gbagbo when rival politician Alassane ­Ouattara seized power following a contested election. More than , people were killed in fighting, including many of Agnes’ close friends. She was freed from prison by the UN, walked to Ghana, and fled to the UK to seek sanctuary. “I came here to save my le,” she tells Alan. “I knew the UK. I’d visited as a diplomat and sent my children to study here.” But when she asked for help, she ended up in the notorious Yarl’s Wood Detention Centre near Bedford.Like news to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters “It was so painful to be in prison again. I was taken three times to the airport to be deported. I thought death was waiting for me at the other side. I was so ­frightened, I tried to trust in God. “I finally have refugee status and am believed, after eight years repeating the same story. Why was I locked up  I still live with the stigma and pain.” At , Alan was beaten every day by Christopher Onslow, a PT instructor. He was punched in the mouth by another officer, John McGee. He knew others were being sexually abused. “They were watching us in the showers, there was something sick about the whole place,” he says. “Onslow was an animal. The weak lads, you could hear the crunch, he was hitting them so hard. It was a pure nightmare.”  Niamh Wilson of Hampson Hughes Solicitors, which represents survivors, adds: “It is shocking that these plans are even being considered. “We’ve worked with over  victims who suffered unimaginable physical and sexual abuse at Medomsley ­Detention Centre – the idea of the site being used again to imprison ­vulnerable people is appalling. I know victims we have supported agree the building needs to be torn down, not used for a further chapter of suffering.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Immigration detention plays a crucial role in a robust immigration system and a signicant proportion of women detained are facing deportation because of criminal offences.  “The immigration removal estate is under ongoing review to ensure the Home Office has sufficient resilience, geographical footprint and capacity for the men and women it is necessary to detain for the purposes of removal, while providing value for money.” The facility at Medomsley later became Hassockfield Secure Training Centre, which closed in . It took until  for Alan to get justice. “I told the court, don’t feel sorry for these little old men – in  they were animals,” he says. “Onslow got eight-and-a-half years. I felt asI had lost eight stone getting that out of us.” Onslow, then , was found guilty of assault and wounding with intent while McGee, then , was jailed for two years and eight months for assault and misconduct in a public office. Agnes is visibly upset. “What I went through, I don’t want to happen to others who just want protection,” she says. “When they harm one lady, they harm a family, ­children. I will campaign until someone hears our cry.” Alan nods. “Fighting the ­Government is one of the hardest things you can do. They don’t listen to people like you and me. They don’t care about people like us. It took me years to get even with these people. “Never give up. Never. If you give up, they get away with it.”To sign Agnes’ petition, visit change.org and search for “women detention centre”Additional reporting Maryam QaiserFOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPriti PatelHome OfficePrisonsCrimePoliticsImmigrationAsylum SeekersChild abuse"},{"url":null,"title":"couple transform run down caravan","story":"NewsCouple transform run-down caravan into dream riverside getaway for less than £,It took Nicola Harris and her husband Mark just four weekends to refit the static camper – and theyve turned it into a lavish lockdown-proof getaway for less than £,mirrorShareCommentsByRia NewmanLaurie Churchman:,  MAY NewsNicola Harris and her husband Mark spent £, transforming a caravan into an ideal holiday home \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Nicola Harris, , fell in love with the lush river views when she visited her brother in Shillingford-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, earlier this year. She and her husband Mark, , decided to buy a static caravan – and then spent under £, turning it into a dream getaway. Half the cost went towards flooring, new blinds and a plush sofa. The caravan looked a little tired when they bought it for £, earlier this year. But with just a few daysapos work, they have given the place a complete refit. Nicola said: “It was really dated, in good condition and quite clean but the décor wasn’t me at all. “I wanted a ‘fixer upper’, something I could really put my mark on. To turn the caravan into a stylish home, the couple took out the fitted sofas and side units in the living room - and then painted all the interior walls and units in the kitchen, bathroom and living room. They also removed the curtains and nets from the windows and replaced them with made-to-measure venetian blinds – and it cost just over £ for the whole van. Nicola and Mark also used stick-on metro tiles to give the kitchen and bathroom a fresher look. They scoured bargain home stores for accessories, getting their hands on lamps, mirrors and fake plants. It took just four weekends to complete the renovation. Nicola says removing the carpet was the worst job. She said: “Apparently they carpet caravans, then add the fitted furniture – so wardrobes, sofas, and even the shower cubicle had the pink carpet underneath. “I was still pulling up carpet at midnight the Sunday evening before the flooring was laid. I could have cried that night!” A local company installed the herringbone vinyl for the floor, which changed the feel of the caravan instantly, but the couple did the rest. Nicola added: “After the flooring was done, I loved seeing each room transformed with just a coat of paint and a few accessories. “I love it – every time I walk in, I smile – it’s such a lovely place to be. “I’m really looking forward to creating wonderful memories down the van with friends and family, especially now we can start socialising again.” The van is just  minutes away from the coupleaposs Oxfordshire home. They said it was important for the family to have a nearby vacation spot as lockdown restrictions ease. Nicola said: “With overseas travel restrictions still in place who knows when we will be able to travel freely again. “We have a two-week holiday booked to the Dominican in July but I’m pretty certain it will be cancelled so we will spend at least one, possibly two, of those weeks here at the van. “The caravan will also be nice for my grown-up children to use with their friends for a getaway, as we have all had holidays cancelled over the last  months. “With the van being right on the river, it really does have a holiday vibe to it.“Although we can’t guarantee the weather in England, when the sun does shine thereaposs no better place to be.She added: Itaposs made me look more at holidaying in England in the future, rather than feeling I always have to jet off somewhere for a break.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnDream Homes"},{"url":null,"title":"covid infections surge more half","story":"NewsCovid infections surge in more than half of England as Indian iant becomes dominantThe rising coronavirus case numbers have been released on the day that Matt Hancock said the Indian iant now account for up to three quarters of new infectionsmirrorShareCommentsByIan JonesMilo BoydReporter:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video matt-hancock-says-people-bolton-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:kkmKY,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

With Covid restrictions gradually being lted punters can now sit inside pubs, with beer gardens no longer the only place to grab a pint.One pub owner has spoken out to thank their customers and to open up candidly about what it has been like to run a pub after lockdown, Yorkshire Live reports. The Wentworth Arms in Mapplewell was allowed to reopen again outside in April after months of being forced to close due to coronavirus restrictions.This week owners said that they held their hands up at some mistakes as they struggled to juggle with preparing and planning how many people would visit the pub.  In an honest post, they said: Whilst we planned and prepared as best we could, weaposve had to learn and adapt as weaposve gone along.Unfortunately you donapost know what you donapost know, for example, how popular the first two weeks would be, how many staff would be required to provide service under the brand new, outside only, table service operating model and look after an unknown number of customers, never mind what the weather would do.The pub also said they sold over  Pornstar Martinis on Monday, April , which caused an issue as they take three to four minutes to make compared to less than  seconds to fill a pint. Owners said it had a big impact on speed of service. They added: We were caught out a little again last week with the popularity of food. Hands up from us for that but again you donapost know what you donapost know. For example on a normal Friday night roughly half of our tables would be just drinking. This Friday pretty much all our  tables plus beer garden tables were dining and most ordered between pm and pm. Serving  plus plates in an hour is beyond our kitchen capacity, so wait times were longer than they should have been. We accept there have been occasions in the last six weeks where weaposve got things wrong or not delivered the level of service we would want to. Thankfully most of the time everything has been to the standards we aim for and we are very grateful for our customersapos patience and understanding when it was not. Pubs are now allowing punters back inside after a further easing of coronavirus restrictions. More lockdown easing could take place at the end of June. The pub added: The last and biggest shout out goes to our awesome staff. For the last six weeks every member of staff has worked pretty much every sht they physically could, theyaposve ed the following day, put their apron and a smile on and got on with the job again. What a team!

The excavation project was sparked after a TV crew reported finding blue material buried in the cellar in Gloucester. It was long suspected Fred West killed the teenager and could have buried her in the basement of the then Pop In cafe in . The -year-old worked at the Pop In café, where Fred was a regular, and her disappearance came at a time when he was abducting, raping and murdering girls and women in Gloucester. But on Thursday Gloucestershire Police announced the dig had been completed and no aposhuman remains or items of signicanceapos had been found.  Police have also said the mystery aposblue materialapos was a burst pipe likely caused by the drilling of the TV production company.The search started after It gained the footage by inserting a camera into a hole their crew had drilled. Assistant Chief Constable Craig Holden said initial imagery detected something blue - but on analysis was most likely detritus or debris from a burst pipe - possibly caused by the drilling. Speaking outside Gloucestershire Constabulary he said: The blue material photographed on an endocope camera by the TV production company was not identied, but we did establish it was likely to be connected to a buried pipe. That pipe [which was not blue] was recovered and excavations went beyond the original endoscope depth. We believe that the drilling may have gone through the pipe and created some sort of detritus or debris, which is what the endoscope picked up.  When we looked, we didnapost see anything blue, so what we believe is that the imagery has given the impression of something blue. Weaposve eliminated that whatever it was that could have been interpreted as blue in that imagery from our investigation. ACC Holden confirmed the cost of the excavation to the taxpayer currently stands at around £, - but could rise to £, or £,. On raising the hopes of Maryaposs family, he said: Itaposs clear to say the family had been contacted by the production company and by the owners of the café. The family were hugely supportive of the work of the production company and I completely understand and accept that the decision made back in  by the then SIO John Bennet and then subsequently the decision that was made the previous chief constable - were reasonable decisions.  The dference here is that new information had come to light that we felt was appropriate to assess. Quite rightly we were approached, new information was provided, that new information predominantly was that there was a blue material in a void within the ground underneath the café. And under careful assessment with our team of investigators and detectives and also nationally accredited experts - we brought those in to assess that information and make a determination as to whether or not there could be a body within that cellar. I believe that the proportionate way that we went about that did take account of whether or not we should search in all areas or some areas. And the guidance and advice from those experts identied the areas that we should be spending more time searching and excavating. Itaposs unfortunate that the initial work that was done through the endoscope and the drilling by the production company couldnapost guarantee that there were no human remains or nothing connected to Maryaposs disappearance. We felt a proportionate excavation was the right, appropriate and proper thing to do. Itaposs absolutely clear that our aim here was to support the family to do everything we possibly could to put Mary to rest on their behalf and I believe that was the right decision. ACC Holden added: Everybody working on this is disappointed that we didnapost find Mary - allowing her family finally to lay her to rest after over  years is absolutely the most important reason for this investigation. Our thoughts are with Maryaposs family, whose continued dignity in recent weeks, and over the many years before, has been absolutely humbling.  Iaposm now confident that Mary is not buried in the cellar of the café, and I hope that eliminating this location will bring some small comfort to her family. We have always been clear that we might not find Maryaposs remains. Sadly, that proved to be the case on this occasion. But it does not mean that we were wrong to look - the new information made it the right thing to do. Serial killer Fred, , committed suicide in prison in  while awaiting trial for  murders. His we Rose, now , was convicted of  murders in the same year and sentenced to le. West is said to have confessed to killing Mary in conversation with his eldest son, Stephen, , but never admitted it to police.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnFred West"},{"url":null,"title":"gang who exploited covid pandemic","story":"NewsGang who exploited Covid pandemic to steal £k of benefits caught trying to flee UKMonika Gorska and her sister Edyta Gorska frequently opened Universal Credit accounts in the names of Polish Nationals, in order to obtain cash from the governmentmirrorShareCommentsByHayley ClarkeMilo BoydReporter:,  MAY NewsMonika Gorska and her sister were caught trying to flee the UK \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The group managed to seal £, from the Department for Work and Pensionsand £, from a Barking bank.Monika Gorska and her sister Edyta Gorska were arrested while trying to flee to Poland on October ,  and their mobile phones were examined, My London reported.Evidence from the DWP showed that the pair were frequently opening Universal Credit accounts in the names of Polish nationals, in order to obtain cash from the government.The multi-person group had first been discovered in February , when Santino Laskowski, , attempted to open a bank account at a branch in Barking, using someone ’s credentials and a fraudulently obtained utility bill. He was arrested at the bank, and his mobile phone was examined by Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit officers.  The phone was found to contain details of several fraudulently opened bank accounts in the names of others, and messages between Laskowski and Ali Tariq exchanging fraudulent bank account information. Later in February , Tariq went to a bank with a Polish man to fraudulently open an account using his details.  Tariq was arrested and officers found that the Polish man had been coerced into opening an account on behalf of Tariq for fraudulent purposes. On the very same day, bank employee Karolina Zmijewska was arrested on suspicion of committing fraud. The bank identied accounts that she had opened which matched those in Laskowski’s phone messages.  Zmijewska denied any wrongdoing when questioned, claiming she had opened the fraudulent bank accounts on behalf of a woman named Gorska. Detective constable Matt Cornell said: “This criminal gang wrongfully thought they could get away with committing £k of fraud, including by exploiting the Universal Credit scheme. “Fortunately, we were able to detect these criminals by working closely with the bank to bring them to justice. “This sentencing is a warning to those who believe they can benefit financially from fraud that they will be caught and punished.”  Will Quince, the minister for welfare delivery at the Department for Work and Pensions, added: “I welcome these sentences which show we work with partners to relentlessly pursue organised criminals who set out to fleece the taxpayer for their own gain. “I’m committed to driving down fraud in the benefits system, ensuring the welfare safety net reaches those in need, and this outcome makes clear that crime doesn’t pay.” Laskowski, , of no known address, was sentenced to two years and four months for conspiracy to defraud the UK banking industry. Tariq, , of Newham, received a two year sentence, suspended for two years, plus a -day rehabilitation course and curfew for conspiracy to commit fraud.  Zmijewska, , of Enfield, received an  month prison sentence for conspiracy to commit fraud. Monika Gorska, , resident of Poland, was handed a two and a half year prison sentence for conspiracy to commit fraud and conspiracy to supply articles for use in fraud. Edyta Gorska, a resident of Poland, received two years for committing money laundering offences.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnDepartment for Work and PensionsBanksPrisonsCrime"},{"url":null,"title":"how getting back board improved","story":"AdvertorialHow getting back on board improved one mans mental healthA National Lottery-supported group helped Marc Lawler get back on his skateboard - and it’s brought his family togethermirrorShareByLaura Tait:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY AdvertorialMarc with his son Brandon at the Hook Skate Park in NottinghamStanding at the top of the ramp, Marc Lawler felt the adrenaline begin to kick in. It was  years since he had last ridden a skateboard – he’d given it up to concentrate on his job as a welder and being a dad to his first child, Jack. But passing a skateboard shop in his hometown of Nottingham, he’d felt the pull of his old hobby. Minutes later, he walked out with a brand new board under his arm. STARTING SLOWLY That was two years ago, and Marc, now , has been brushing up on his skills. “It took me a while to get back into it, but I gradually got there,” he says. “I live opposite a skate park so I could see when it was quiet and I’d time my visits for then. Marc wasn’t sure how his body would stand up to the thrills – and inevitable spills – of the sport: “I started slowly so I didn’t hurt myself, and didn’t attempt anything more complicated than just moving round on the board at first. “I wasn’t too worried about what people thought, though. One of the good things about being older is that you care less about what people think.” As he grew more confident, Marc began to share his hobby with his family.  His -year-old son, Brandon, also had a skateboard, so the pair headed to a Skate Nottingham event, where the coaches taught them tricks and techniques. “Brandon will try stunts that I’m just too cautious to do,” says Marc. “I used to skate ramps, jumping from one and landing on another but it’s too dangerous now. I might crack my head or injure my knee and I’m too old for that. My worst injury has been a rolled ankle.” Marc sticks to street-style skating, where he uses kerbs and rails to skate on. “I taught myself to skate on rails by starting on low walls and then building up,” he explains. “It can take me anything from a week to nearly a year to learn a new trick. It feels great when I can master one that I’ve been working on for ages.” While Marc can skate some impressive rails, he’s still trying to master a basic kick flip, which involves jumping up, flipping the board over and landing on it. Skate Nottingham puts on National Lottery-funded events at skate parks, workshop venues and public spaces around the city, encouraging people of all ages to give it a go. It’s just one of many good causes to have benefited from National Lottery funding, thanks to the £ million raised every week* by players. For Marc it has become a family affair as his stepson, Bill, , joined in and the trio began to explore Nottingham’s skate parks. “We decided to visit as many as possible,” says Marc. “There are such a lot of them now and they’re all really well designed. We started before lockdown but have begun to explore dferent skate parks again now that things are beginning to open up again. And thanks to the support of The National Lottery, many of these parks have the funds to be maintained and improved. Marc started to go to more Skate Nottingham events to show others that you could skateboard regardless of your age. He also began to make friends as he saw the same faces at dferent events. “I didn’t have lots of confidence and I thought I was quite shut off from other people,” says Marc. “But it’s such an inclusive pastime that I began to really feel part of the community.” Meanwhile Marc and the boys began to record the skate parks they visited, and they have ventured further afield. At the last count they had visited around  parks, going as far as Cornwall. “We’re hoping to hit the  mark but we won’t stop there,” says Marc. “It’s become a real family affair too. My elder son, Jack, has started coming along for the ride and to explore new areas, and my -year-old stepdaughter Esme wants to get some roller skates.”  FURTHER BENEFITS As well as bringing them closer as a family, there have been some other benefits too. “It really helped with my mental health over lockdown,” says Marc. “It gave me the space to take some time for myself and unwind. And it’s helped me get to know Bill better. “I’ve also noticed that Brandon is really changing the way he approaches learning new things. In the skate park, he has to stop and assess things logically and I can see that having a positive effect at school too.” How the money you raise is raising smiles In these challenging times it’s great to be able to put a smile on people’s faces. And when you play The National Lottery you’re helping people to do exactly that – whether it’s by bringing the world of the Vikings to le or driving the unique underground train in London’s Postal Museum.  Many of those who have benefited from funding have faced their own le challenges. They include Ekow Otoo, who hasn’t let multiple sclerosis stop him achieving sporting glory. He now stars in The National Lottery’s stunning new TV ad, in which he pulls off some spectacular moves in his wheelchair at a skate park.

Kate proved true to her word and when she invited little Mila Sneddon and her family to the Queen’s official Edinburgh home, wore an ME+EM outfit that matched the four-year-old’s dress. The outgoing little girl who is battling cancer has captured the duchess’ heart and when they met she told the youngster she wanted to give her a “big squeezy cuddle”. Mila was featured in an iconic picture from Kate’s lockdown photographic project and came to symbolise isolation during the pandemic after she was pictured kissing her home’s kitchen window as her father stood outside.  The little girl is undergoing chemotherapy for leukaemia and was photographed separated from her father during the first lockdown, after he had to go to work and could not risk bringing coronavirus into the family home in Falkirk.Kate and Mila had talked on the phone after the image was among  selected for the duchess’ Hold Still exhibition and book and agreed to meet up. The pair met at the Palace of Holyroodhouse and when Kate walked into the room the little girl the face of the little girl, who was joined by her parents, lit up.  “Hi Mila, look at you, Kate said. I want to give you a big squeezy cuddle, it’s so nice to meet you in person. The four-year-old stood up as did her father and mother Scott and Lynda Sneddon and her big sister Jodi. Kate praised the little girl who was dressed head-to-toe in pink with matching headband, dress and shoes. She said: “I love your dress, can you do a little twirl - and your shoes.”  The four-year-old spun round for the future Queen before running over to her father. The couple are carrying out an extensive tour of Scotland in William’s role as Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.  During their visit to the Balfour Hospital in Kirkwall, William praised trauma nurse Dr Tariro Gandiya: “It must be reassuring to know we are all in this together.” The Cambridges are known by their Scottish title the Earl and Countess of Strathearn when north of the border, and Kate wore a Strathearn tartan scarf and a coat by Massimo Dutti for the visit.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnKate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgeRoyal Family"},{"url":null,"title":"mirror book club reviews amol","story":"NewsopinionMirror Book Club reviews Amol Rajan, Richard Osman, David Mitchell, Meriel SchindlerThis week we review Rethink: Leading Voices On Le After Crisis And How We Can Make A Better World, edited by Amol Rajan, Us Three, by Ruth Jones, The Lost Cafe Schindler by Meriel Schindler, The Thursday Murder Club by Richard Osman, Utopia Avenue by David Mitchell and Project Hail Mary by Andy WeirmirrorShareCommentsByCharlotte Heathcote:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsopinionJoin the Mirror Book Club today\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Rethink: Leading Voices On Le After Crisis And How We Can Make A Better World, by Amol RajanBBC Books, £. Will Covid- prove to be a global ‘reset’ moment  That’s the hope that runs through Rethink, a star-studded collection of  short essays edited by Amol Rajan. He says that “we are living through one of history’s epoch shts” in which ecological devastation, a technological revolution, and a sht in global power towards China and the East are rapidly transforming societies across the globe. So how can we build back better from the pandemic and tackle the biggest problems we face at the same time  An impressive list of contributors share their ideas. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  They include Pope Francis who urges us to stop ignoring the poor, and the Dalai Lama on seeking peace of mind. Prince Charles explores the inextricable link between the health and wellbeing of people and the planet, and Jarvis Cocker calls for an ­“environmental revolution” with “fallow years for the planet”. Physicist Carlo Rovelli argues that instead of nations competing with one another or fighting, resources must be pooled globally. The wide range of writers emphasises just how much Covid- has impacted everyone, irrespective of background. And there’s a great deal of common ground here with many contributors arguing that we must all become more active and cooperative citizens.  If Rethink has a weakness, it’s that the long list of contributors leaves little space for developing ideas in detail. Nevertheless, this thought-provoking and erse collection of voices articulates the greatest challenges we face and shares bright ideas about how best to address them. By HUSTON GILMORE Us Three, by Ruth Jones Black Swan, £. Lana, Judith and Catrin celebrate leaving school with a Greek holiday that changes their lives. Judith uncovers disturbing truths about her father’s history, while a local man breaks Catrin’s heart – but she hasn’t heard the last of him.

By ANNE CATER The Lost Cafe Schindler, by Meriel Schindler Hodder  Stoughton, £  In this compelling and beautully written account, Meriel Schindler traces her Jewish ancestors’ experiences across two tumultuous centuries. And she tells a remarkable and inspiring story that attests to the strength and compassion of the human spirit in overcoming the tragedy of persecution. Meriel’s story begins with the death of her father Kurt in . She found him dficult and untrustworthybut, after his death, she visited his isolated rundown cottage and discovered a treasure trove of family papers and photographs. As she began to piece the family history together, she decided to embark on a journey through Austria, Italy and the US to fill in the gaps, tracing family members and trawling through archives. Those archives take her back to th century Bohemia when her ancestors were tavern keepers, though the Schindlers moved to Austria after Jews were offered equal citizenship. In , her grandfather Hugo and great-uncle Erich opened Cafe Schindler, renowned for live jazz, dancing and apple strudel. But, in , Hitler seized power. Hugo was attacked on Kristallnacht and, though he escaped to England, there is moving testimony from Meriel’s great-aunt, awaiting deportation to a Nazi death camp . By the end, Meriel has a better understanding of her troubled father. This fascinating family history also reminds us why we must remain vigilant to prevent evil overwhelming decency. By EDWARD ARGYLE The Thursday Murder Club, by Richard Osman Penguin, £.  The Thursday Murder Club are Elizabeth, Joyce, Ibrahim and Ron who live in a retirement village, a former convent owned by villainous Ian Ventham, who plans to dig up the nuns’ graveyard to build more homes.

They are bassist Dean, haunted by abuse gted guitarist Jasper, tormented by a knocking sound in his head folk pianist Elf, hamstrung by heartache and gruff drummer Grf. There are cameos from Bowie, Hendrix and Brian Jones – and a devastating event that changes everything. By CHARLOTTE HEATHCOTE Project Hail Mary, by Andy Weir Del Rey, £ Former software engineer Andy Weir struck it big with his bestseller The Martian which was made into a film starring Matt Damon. This time, Weir’s hero is Ryland Grace, another wise-cracking astronaut, who wakes as the only survivor of a mission to save mankind. Although Grace’s memory is patchy at first, flashbacks reveal that an algae-like creature is depleting the sun’s energy, putting Earth’s food supply and millions of lives at risk. Grace has been sent to study the one star that seems unaffected by the scourge and report back to Earth. But his is a lonely suicide mission, though he can’t remember why, with only enough fuel for a one-way trip and no way of knowinghis findings will reach Earth safely. The book kicks into high gear when Grace crosses paths with an alien le form on the same mission. In classic buddy comedy style, Grace and Rocky complement each other’s strengths and shortcomings as they work together to save their planets. This joyous space romp is a smart and satisfying ode to the power of science and the ties that bind us.

More than  cases of the new strain have been identied across the country. Known as VUI-MAY- , the iant was first detected in Thailand in people who had travelled from Egypt, Public Health England confirmed. It was designated as a iant under investigation on May  on the basis of the mutation profile and increased importation from a widening international area. There is currently no evidence that this iant causes more severe disease or renders the vaccines any less effective. PHE is carrying out laboratory testing to better understand the impact of the mutations on the behaviour of the virus.  The organisation did not disclose where the cases had been detected but said test and trace has been used to limit the spread.While scientists keep an eye on the new strain, the Indian iant has quickly become the dominant version of coronavirus in the UK. It was reported yesterday that the iant - B... - was detected in  local authorities in the week ending  May. That is an  per cent weekly increase, according to figures from the Wellcome Sanger Institute which sequences a random sample of positive tests in the community.  Today Matt Hancock announced this afternoon that the Indian iant was still spreading, with between half and three quarters of new cases now the mutant strain. Thailand has not been too badly impacted by Covid- compared to other similar sized countries, reporting  deaths during the whole of the pandemic.  On May  it reported its highest number of daily cases however, with the majority of cases stemming from overcrowded prisons.

The property was abandoned five years ago. Now, an auction house has put the exciting three-bed home up with the six-figure guide price – adding that it is in need of refurbishment. Auction House South Yorkshire said the home will be sold as seen, with no explanation for its mucky condition. The terraced home, nestled in the Hillsborough suburb of Sheffield, comes fully furnished – with rubbish, rotting food, and heaps of bin bags scattered in every room. The new owner will have to get their hands dirty.  The three-storey house boasts a cellar on the lower ground level, a kitchen and living room on the ground floor, three bedrooms and family bathroom. The new owner will also be treated to a erse selection of discarded toys and dirty rags. The kitchen features a stained cooker, rusty pots and pans, and a bottle of washing up liquid – which, surprisingly, appears to have been opened. Wallpaper in the top bedroom has been stripped off to reveal a rustic brick look. The shared bathroom is certainly unique – it has been fitted with a bath as well as a leather chair, and comes with an old toilet roll. The listing adds the property is just a stone’s throw away from an array of bars, restaurants and shops, as well as a tram and bus stop with links to the city centre.  But there was shock when the property was posted on social media in its soiled state.Craig Beresford, commenting on Facebook, quipped: “Hope furnitureaposs NOT included.”Mitch Wood said it would be better to get the wrecking ball out and knock [the] lot down”. Some people were more hopeful. Elyse Maria Bingham joked she had finally found her forever home.  She commented: “After having some setbacks and a few hurdles to jump over, weaposve finally bagged our forever home.” Itaposs not the first time a seriously grimy house has been up for sale.A property in Birmingham with unmade beds, a rubbish-strewn living room, piles of washing up in the sink and a filthy bathroom was put on the market in . Grim pictures of the house, which was on the market for £,, show it in a severe state of neglect with every room covered in discarded clothes, food and rubbish.It sold for its asking price despite the shocking snaps – before mysteriously appearing back on the market.Earlier this year, a home which came with an assortment of terrying plastic housemates was put on the market sale in the US.The three-bedroom duplex in South Lake Tahoe was said to have great income property potential – and it was put up for sale as-is. That meant the lucky new owner also bought more than a dozen creepy female mannequins dressed in sparkly gowns and wigs.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd Comment"},{"url":null,"title":"prince charles laughs prince harrys","story":"NewsPrince Charles laughs off Prince Harrys attacks as he struggles to drink pintThe Prince of Wales sipped a drink in an eponymously named pub in Clapham, south London to mark the reopening of hospitality on ThursdaymirrorShareCommentsByRussell MyersJonathan ColesReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video charles-camilla-visit-prince-wales-,customFields:,clearance:Network,source:ceaefcdbe,sourceUrl:patrick purcell,site:Mirror,brandSafety: Sport and specialist news – passed for ad targeting,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:iwVNgQBF,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The Prince of Wales sipped a drink in an eponymously named pub in Clapham, south London to mark the reopening of hospitality. Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, looked on as the heir to the throne worked out the way best way to get to his drink. Charles is yet to respond publicly to allegations made by Harry that he made him suffer while growing up. The Duke of Sussex has used a new docuseries on Apple TV to level several allegations at the royal family.Do you have a view on this story  Email webnews@mirror or let us know in the comments below. Harry accused relatives of showing him total neglect and telling him to play the game - so his le would improve. And in another interview this month on the Armchair Expert podcast, he said: When it comes to parenting,Iaposve experienced some form of pain and suffering because of the pain and suffering that perhaps my father or parents suffered, Iaposm gonna make sure I break that cycle so that I donapost pass it on. Charles and Camilla visited the capital to show support as pubs, bars, restaurants and shops reopened after the pandemic. The pair chatted to staff and members of the public before grabbing a drink themselves. The couple marvelled at the pub which was inside was crammed with an eclectic array of items - from traffic lights to glaze legs brought back by a former owner from his travels around the globe.As he walked in, pulling a mask on, Charles commented: I’ve always thought it would be rather fun to go round visiting every Prince of Wales in the country.Hopefully I’d get a free drink in each one! The couple then chatted to owners Dermott Connell and Terry Slate before walking behind the bar Now, Charles said enthusiastically. Do you want me to pull a pint   The royal couple admired the amount of spirits on display before making their way to the pumps. He was ushered towards Sambrook’s Wandle, a locally brewed bitterHere we go, the future king said as he began pulling the lever.Looking at his handiwork he said: I think that’s enough. I’m not going to drink it all. He then got the giggles as he attempted to pull up his mask for a sip. Bit dficult this one, he said.That’s going to be an interesting one to drink through a mask, joked Camila.Venues have been able to welcome customers inside in groups of up to six from May . While Charles is yet to issue a statement in response to Harryaposs comments, it is said he is boiling with anger. Royal expert Nick Bullen, editor in chief of True Royal TV, said the prince is hurt and disappointed by his youngest sonaposs comments, but is holding back from responding publicly. He told US Weekly: It appears nothing is off limits now, he said. Itaposs sad that their private family affairs are being aired in public yet again. Mr Bullen said the revelations from Prince Harryaposs interviews with Oprah Winfrey and others have come as a huge surprise to prince Charles, who is boiling with anger over his sonaposs comments. He feels tortured by Harry with his constant digs. He wishes heaposd just let it drop, he said. The general consensus within the royal family is to ignore Harryaposs behaviour to avoid fanning the flames, but Charles is finding it hard to hold back. He really wants to defend himself.  He also spoke to Winfrey back in March alongside we Meghan Markle when claims of racism from within the royal family were made.

Jo from The Vanbrugh told My London: On each category there is an option to buy the staff a drink as they work incredibly hard and since we have been forced to operate in a dferent way their tips have not been to a level of before lockdown. So it’s a means for them to either get a drink or a tip from the customers. And as for the reason itaposs called c**k for servers : Jo simply explains: C**k is short for cocktail as the app wont let us the whole sentence as you are only allowed to use a certain amount of letters. This also explains a second menu item higher up on the list, which offers a cocky tee for the team. Jo says: This just the heading for that group to draw attention to it as again the other spirits and wines also have them. Again cocky tee is just another word for cocktails. No one has mentioned it to us before and it has not been set up to offend as we are a very erse, family friendly pub. Jo said that The Vanbrugh will be removing the menu items to clear up any potential confusion for more customers, telling My London: It could be seen as inappropriate and we do not want to upset or offend anyone.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPubs"},{"url":null,"title":"rose wests lawyer believes mary","story":"NewsLawyer believes Fred West dumped missing Mary Bastholms remains at rubbish tip or lakeEXCLUSIVE: Leo Goatley told the Mirror he was unsurprised when police found nothing in their dig at a Gloucester cafe - and thinks it more likely Fred disposed of Mary’s body in a tip his brother John delivered tomirrorShareCommentsByAdam AspinallNews reporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsMary was  at time she disappeared \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Fred would come out and chuck bags on board.”Explaining his other theory, he said: “At the time he was an odd-job man at the Lakeside caravan site at Stokes Orchard so my theory has long been he may have put the body parts in the lake.” Fred never confessed to killing Mary Bastholm but his son Stephen claimed his father admitted it to him. The £, police search of the cafe was sparked when a TV firm drilled a hole in its basement and saw something blue. Mary, , was wearing blue when she vanished.Like news to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters It is now believed this could have been blue debris from a buried pipe.

He criticised his father Prince Charles for expecting his sons to endure the pressures of royal le rather than offering protection – and accused the royals of total neglect when Meghan was feeling suicidal.

He said he is finally free to talk about his innermost feelings, and levelled a series of criticisms at the Royal Family.He said that he and Meghan - along with their son Archie - spent four years trying to make it work, but their requests for help when Meghan was suicidal were met with total silence, total neglect.  We did everything that we possibly could to stay there and carry on doing the role and doing the job, he stated. But Meghan was struggling. That feeling of being trapped within the family, there was no option to leave, he added. Eventually when I made that decision for my family, I was still told, aposYou canapost do thisapos. And itaposs like, aposWell how bad does it have to get until I am allowed to do this apos She [Meghan] was going to end her le. It shouldnapost have to get to that.In another recent interview, Harry said growing up in the spotlight had felt like a mixture between The Truman Show and being in a zoo.He told the Armchair Expert Podcast he would think: I donapost want to be here, I donapost want to be doing this, look what it did to my mum. How am I ever going to settle down and have a we and family when I know itaposs going to happen again. For all the heartache, it is understood the Queen is getting along well with Harry and Meghanaposs son Archie.

Things like aposapos, meaning ran out of product, aposapos meaning a customer waiting, aposapos meaning to catch, and aposapos to refer to an attractive customer.

One person claried that the use of aposapos meant they thought you were the hottest person in the building, while aposapos meant you were a hottie. While another said that when they fancied a female punter they would sneakily refer to them using the word aposshoesapos. They commented: Glasgow bartender here. When I saw the title I thought of all the codes you mentioned. Plus, we use aposshoesapos to mean an attractive woman. The bar I used to work in was frequented by bartenders a lot, so we changed that to aposgarnishesapos. A number of other codes were shared for bartending tasks, with someone  claiming they used the number aposapossomething was almost out of stock, aposapos for completely out of stock and aposapos once it was restocked. They went on to say that aposapos and aposapos were used to tell their colleagues they were going to the bathroom, while aposapos meant they needed a smoke break and aposapos was for when they were hungry and going to eat.

I saw these two orange lobsters from a distance and thought they were toys because thataposs the only time Iaposve seen them orange apart from when theyaposre cooked. I knew they wouldnapost have put cooked lobsters in there because you need to keep lobsters in a special tank with flowing water below seven degrees. I thought someone was having a joke and had put a couple of orange toy lobsters in the tank.  I got closer and noticed they were alive. I couldnapost believe my eyes. Iaposve been going to Makro for ten years and used to be a fishmonger myself but I have never seen anything like that before. Rob the fishmonger told me they were really, really rare lobsters and to get one in the tank was a one in  million chance so the chances of having two are one in a billion. It is like getting struck by lightning three times and surviving each time. To have not just one but two in the tank is unimaginable. The dad-of-two, from Leicester, decided to try and save the lobsters from being sold so spoke to the store manager who agreed to donate them to an aquarium. He said: I couldnapost bare the thought that these extremely rare creatures would end up on someoneaposs plate. I spoke to the manager of the catering ision who said they would donate them to a Sea Le Centre. Itaposs just incredible to see two of these amazingly coloured lobsters. Iaposm glad theyaposve been saved so they can be enjoyed by people. Live lobsters normally have dark brown or grey colouring which makes it easier for them to camouflage in the wild. They only turn orange after they are cooked, making the sight of two with a carrot-coloured exoskeleton even more rare. Makro store manager Anthony Burrage said: We have donated them to Birmingham Sea Le centre. After they arrived in the store from our delivery partners we realised they were unique and not the norm we called our Quality Assurance department and they did the rest. They called Birmingham Sea Le and they were collected on Saturday.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @MirrorWeirdNewsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnRare animalsViral"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.10857157-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.10857157-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.10857157-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.10857157-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"car flips onto its side near busy dundee roundabout","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remA car flipped onto its side near a busy Dundee roundabout on Thursday night and resulted in a female driver being taken to Ninewells Hospital.The two vehicle collision happened just before .pm, with the woman cut out of her vehicle by fire crews before being taken to hospital.The incident took place at the Scott Fyffe roundabout just off the Arbroath Road in the city, with police, ambulance and fire crews all in attendance.One eyewitness said: #There were two ambulances making their way to the scene when I drove past, as well as some traffic police and a fire crew.#Traffic was still being allowed to flow towards Broughty Ferry.#A spokesman for SFRS said: #We received a call from Police Scotland at .pm to report a two vehicle crash at the  roundabout.#Two cars are involved and one is reported to be on its side.

accused of #passing the parcel# of the cost of helping north-east tourist attractions recover from the pandemic.Industry bosses have pitched the idea of brown, tourism signs on the A Aberdeen bypass, pointing visitors in the direction of the area#s cultural highlights.But Transport Scotland has said it would be for the tourist attractions to foot the bill, as they open up for business after their worst year trading in decades.The absence was raised by the National Trust For Scotland.Its many historic properties in Deeside and Donside could easily be accessed using the billion-pound Aberdeen Western Peripheral Routewhich stretches from Stonehaven to Blackdog.The charity#s north-east general manager Iain Hawkins said: #The -mile AWPR has created a bypass of important city and Aberdeenshire places including Royal Deeside, art galleries, heritage properties such as Crathes Castle and Haddo House, multiple museums # all of which share a lack of profile or wayfinding for those travelling through our region.#Brown tourist signage is simply critical: Dundee VA would not consider operating within the city without clear directional brown signage and similarly Aberdeen city and shire should not consider this current position acceptable particularly when its tourism sector requires such crucial support.#Take Royal Deeside for instance the fact there is no signage highlighting the way to Balmoral # a really important site for Scotland # is just not good enough.#I understand brown tourism signs are really expensive but it is really important too.#I believe that AWPR signage is critical to supporting the bounce back of north-east attractions and would help to reignite our visitor economy.#As we see the critical international trade come back again # as we will one day # we need to help ourselves.#Mr Hawkins, who previously ran the tourist attractions of Blackpool pleasure beach, highlighted brown signs remained in parts of Aberdeen, but were yet to be put up on the new dual carriageway around the the city.However, hopes of a helping hand from government towards the cost of the pricey posts were dashed when the Scottish roads body reiterated it would be for destinations to foot the bill.A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “The onus is on the inidual visitor attractions to apply for signage, where they meet the criteria set out in the relevant guidance, and approvals will be determined by the location of the proposed signage.“The costs of the signage will be dictated by the size of the sign required and the tourist attraction would be expected to fund the cost.”Mr Hawkins said the suggestion was #surprising# given the #suffering# endured by the tourism industry throughout the pandemic and called for ministers to look at introducing the signs as part of a #strategic economic approach#.He added: #Passing the parcel of costs to the tourism operators does not seem to be a productive way to go about this.#It is fair to say that some operators including charitable organisations such as the National Trust For Scotland would not be in a position to take this cost and to procure such signage.#The completion of the AWPR without tourist directional signage is unacceptable and is not representative of all other towns and cities within the UK.#The National Trust For Scotland is sounding out support for their calls # but has already won the backing of the north-east tourist board.Visit Aberdeenshire chief executive Chris Foy said the signs could perhaps uncover hidden gems which would prompt visitors to come back to the area.“We welcome consideration of any initiative that can help to reignite and sustain the visitor economy, and make it easier for visitors to discover the north-east,# he said.“Even in an age of satnav and smart phones, the recognisable brown signs can be an effective way finder for many visitors, and can also promptvisits to explore more attractions.”And Aberdeen City Council # keen to highlight the recently-refurbished art gallery, #jewel in the crown# beach and other attractions hoped to pull visitors off the fast track of the A # is also keen to take the idea to the Scottish Government.But onlythe initiative was to come for free.Conservative leader on the council Ryan Houghton, who controls the purse strings as city growth convener, said: “Anything that supports tourism within Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire is something that the council welcomes.“Alongside the National Trust For Scotland, we would be happy to lobby the Scottish Government # which controls the AWPR # to ensure appropriate road signage is put in place to highlight the many tourism attractions that are available throughout the north-east region.“I am confident that should Transport Scotland agree to fund appropriate road signage, then the local authorities would quickly move to ensure these signs were put up in appropriate places to encourage tourists to visit the many worthwhile attractions that the north-east offers.#As the huge bypass was being completed, Trump International complained about the Menie Estate golf course being #cut off# due to a lack of signs.Brown signs highlighting the north coastal route, towards Newburgh and Cruden Bay on the A, have been erected on the A Balmedie to Tipperty road, which built alongside the £bn bypass.For as little as £. a month you can access all of

programme now under way, we#ve put together a collection of Covid vaccine tracker charts to monitor the progress of the Covid- vaccine rollout across the UK.How many people have been vaccinated How many people have received the vaccine in my area Which demographics have received the vaccine When will I receive my coronavirus vaccine The Covid vaccine tracker below shows an at-a-glance view of the current proportion of the Scottish population who have received the first and second dose of either the Oxford AstraZaneca or the Pfizer BioNTech vaccination so far.The table below is an at-a-glance view of the total figures by group.Data on the number of people vaccinated was initially provided in a weekly report from Public Health Scotland, however there was immense pressure to keep the public more regularly informed so on January  the statistics began to be provided each day.The chart below shows the daily numbers of first and second doses provided.The chart below shows the cumulative number of people who have received each dose since the vaccination programme began on December .It#s also helpful to look at this data as a proportion of the Scottish population so you can see how the percentage of people vaccinated grows over time.The chart below shows the progress for each UK country.On January , Public Health Scotland provided this data broken down by vaccine type which is shown in the chart below.The map below shows the available data on the regional rollout of the vaccination programme.January  saw the release of data by local authority area for the first time, which is shown in the map below.Regional data was originally available on a weekly basis but moved to a daily upload on February . The chart below contains data on the daily number of doses provided and the population covered. Use the drop down box to select your area and the buttons to move between daily vaccinations, cumulative vaccinations and the percentage of the population who have received first doses.Similarly to the regional data, data by demographics were originally provided in the weekly PHS report # however on February  they moved to a daily publication schedule.The chart below shows the daily number of people who have had first doses in each age range, as well as the percentage of that population, covered.Public Health Scotland began reporting daily statistics on vaccinations by JCVI categories in mid-March. The chart below shows the percentage of each group who have received their first and second doses.The vaccines are being provided in accordance with the priority list drawn up by the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation .

But that was just Ally.I was the last player to get into the squad. There was debate about whether it would be me, Ian Wallace from Coventry or Andy Gray from Aston Villa and that was how I found out.Although we didn’t do as well as we wanted in Argentina, featuring in the tournament is still something I’m proud of.I only played  minutes of one game and when anybody asks about it I always say I was unbeaten in the World Cup game I played#unfortunately that game was against Iran, who we should have beaten rather than drawing -.I had a lot of great days with Aberdeen and won the Premier Division, Scottish Cup and League Cup, but to play for Scotland in a tournament was the biggest honour of my career.The players who get to wear the jersey this summer will feel the same I would imagine.For them it may be even more special, because there have been many good players over the last  years who haven’t had the chance.Since Steve Clarke became Scotland manager, there seems to be a lot more optimism around the national team and that’s only increased since qualying for the Euros.Under Clarke, Scotland have found an identity.Since Craig Brown’s tenure as manager, there have been occasions where Scotland have looked rudderless.But that isn’t the case under Steve # there seems to be a clear plan and I think the current manager is very similar to Craig in a number of ways.Craig was always well-prepared and didn’t leave anything to chance.His teams were always organised, he altered his tactics depending on the opposition and was very thorough and methodical when he did the job and Steve is similar.

To use a golfing term there were quite a lot of #shanks# about, with Scott #Lefty# Gargan and Fiona McLeod locked in battle with their mates John Kennedy and Dorothy Clark, who had a vice-like grip on the match, whipping ahead -.In the league cross-over game, dark horses Mark Harkness and Richard Dewar were put to the sword by the evergreen Sandy Crawford and young Murray MacDonald.Neither of the two to-guns were wearing a mask on the green, but they ought to have as they robbed the dark horses at the last post to ride into the sunset with victory by an - margin.The week#s star pair were undoubtedly Anne Moore and Libby McGuinness, who were in cruise control for most of their match against Roddy MacDonald and Jamie MacLean.The Penelope Pitstop and Dick Dastardly of this whacky race left only scorched tyre tracks as they sped to an impressive - victory, despite Libby#s concern that the Arkansas Chuggabugs had a secret weapon, to pull out six shots in the last end.As the next round approaches, Guy and Ward willto the gym the undertaker will need to resurrect his form, the postman will need to deliver and the tea table out at Lingerton will be ided, with some cups tasting just that bit sweeter.With the Portavadie Cup, for the seasons most consistent player, well underway, a few players have posted notable wins with Liz Long notching her first three pointer and Colin #Last Bowl# MacInnes remaining unbeaten."},{"url":null,"title":"cash jump for youth football","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It involves GPs, nurses, an army of health professionals and lots of support staff. It is essentialwe are to achieve what the publicsay is a priority, enjoying a healthy le.

And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement. That means we are an essential part of the system.It seems clear that we are going to have to fight to get past the unconscious assumptions of decision makers.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside kids vote for nature","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

However, there now seems to be an acceptance in Transport Scotland that a new solution has to be found.In a letter to the press, George Allan points out that the -mile route from Strathlachlan to Colintraive and the eight miles between Ormidale and Tighnabruaich were designed and constructed in  or  years.I was a member of the survey and design team on these routes. I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.Philip Shimmin, Inverness.Sir,I would like to say thank you to all the lads who have been working at the Crinan Canal # often when the north winds were blowing and water was pouring down from the hills into the empty canal more quickly than the pumps were able to remove it.The men greeted me each morning as I walked past to go over the temporary bridge. They were trying to renew the basement concrete which supports the new bridges in spite of the wet, cold weather.Fortunately, April was drier and they managed to fit the new gates thanks to the massive cranes and the skill of the lorry drivers carrying these heavy loads to and from the canal.Others have cleared the rubbish, including lots of old car tyres, which had been dumped.It is good to see the canal filled and in working order again.J Thorgrimsson, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"reduce farm costs save time and make life easier","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

With the evenings getting longer and brighter you can use your garden or patio as a great extension to your home and just sit back and relax.It’s at this time of year that lawns need to be mowed more frequently, so here are some key pointers on getting that perfect cared-for look.Mow at least once a week and raise the mower blades when it’s very hot weather. Don’t mow when grass is wet or during a drought and don’t collect your clippings during dry spells as this helps conserve moisture.Keep watering throughout the summer unless there is a water shortage and repair bare patches with turf or re-seeding.This is also the month to ensure that all your plants are adequately fed, particularly those in baskets and tubs.Plants benefit from a regular feeding programme as they are growing vigorously and need their nutrition levels to be kept up. Slow-release granules are a good idea for pots and baskets because they last for about six months and release food as it is required into the compost.Not often thought of as a container plant, but an excellent option for small gardens, is a rose.A simple solution for June is to create an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.Just buy a selection of dferent sized pots, plant them with a ieties of roses and then place them together in a group.There is a rose for every garden situation. From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew. Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and midsummer day arrives, here are few ‘must do’ jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters a unique holiday destination","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But never mind, Chinese astronauts, who regard a moon base as essential for probing outer space, have just about solved these problems with a bioregenerative le support system called Yuegong-, or Lunar Palace  . LP is a temperature and humidity-controlled, sealed, articial human-animal-plant-microorganism ecosystem in which oxygen, water and food sources are recycled to create an Earth-like environment. The latest experiment had LP in use continuously for a whole year, with two crews of four each having two periods of occupation and the maximum stay being  days. All emerged fit and healthy.LP comprises a living area, two cabins for growing plants , an animal-raising room housing yellow mealworms and waste treatment and storage rooms.Crew requirements # food, water, oxygen and waste disposal # are accommodated as follows: plants and mealworms provide food, the latter being processed into ‘flour’ for bread.Plant photosynthesis provides oxygen and consumes CO, while puried water from plant transpiration and condensation provides drinking and washing water.Nitrogen puried from crew urine generates plant fertiliser, while the remaining urine is puried along with waste water for plant irrigation.Crew faeces mixed with straw are fermented by bacteria to produce CO for plant photosynthesis, while fermented vegetable waste is fed to the mealworms. The whole system achieved  per cent recycling, the only non-recyclable product requiring storage being solid waste from fermented faeces.All this represents huge progress, but we are not there yet. Running LP requires massive energy input, particularly since lunar days and nights each last an Earth month, and the nights are freezing.But still, I have read of plans to build kilometre-high lunar towers bearing solar  , possible because of the moon’s zero gravity, but don’t hold your breath!* https:doi.org . ...# arxiv.org abs ."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 21 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

How can we move the figure up and ensure we get all managers contributing #Jane Fowler, head of improvement and HR with the council, responded: #We would have loved to have had a greater response to that. These things come with conflicting pressures on managers’ time, which is why we offer the opportunity to be part of a working group.#The performance in getting responses to surveys is something we want to improve. We have had communications about how to pick it up.#Councillor Findlay, one of three members for the Isle of Bute ward, then asked: #Should it be compulsory for managers to complete the survey #It is vital that managers lead and lead well, so I am quite disappointed by the response.#Ms Fowler replied: #We try to avoid compulsion because we are trying to work collaboratively with our colleagues. We look to get as wide a representation as we can.#Feedback to the nature of the policy itself was more positive, with SNP Helensburgh and Lomond South councillor Richard Trail saying: #I welcome this change of emphasis, changing the policy from talking about absence to supporting attendance.#This, we hope, will improve attendance, but how will we measure that in the months and years ahead  Have you any kind of measures you will be able to bring to us ##We have detailed information on what our absences have been like during Covid,# responded Ms Fowler. #We had a requirement to report on it on a weekly basis.#We will see levels of absence reported on scorecards so members can see what our rates of absence are.

Eight designs will be chosen to become stamps which will be on sale across the UK.Children may choose to illustrate frontline workers in health or social care.They may want to celebrate other key workers who have kept the country going, such as refuse collectors, cleaners, teachers, supermarket workers, public transport staff, delivery drivers or, indeed, postmen and postwomen.Or they might highlight the volunteers who have helped in their local communities or raised money for charity, such as the late Captain Sir Tom Moore.The competition is open until Friday May . A special  of judges will select the winners. As with all special stamps, the final eight designs will be sent to HM The Queen before they can be printed and issued as stamps.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The shutdown means the loss of nine jobs at the plant, but local farmers believe the knock-on effect on employment will be even worse.Farmer and shareholder in the company Tony Archibald said: #It could mean the loss of another job on every dairy farm, not to mention the milk tanker driver.#The farmers are looking at ways of opening the creamery. It is very important because it is the one thing we have as a raw material for over here.#The farmers were due to meet as the Courier went to press to discuss ways of re-opening the creamery and they also plan to meet representatives of Scottish Milk.Mr Coffield described the closure as #devastating#. He said: #There#s not a lot of work round here. The main feeling about the place is disbelief.#The creamery produced about  tonnes of cheese a year.FIFTY YEARS AGOColour TV comes to CampbeltownColour television is to be launched in Campbeltown next Tuesday by Redfusion.And to mark the occasion, Redfusion is staging a demonstration exhibition in the town#s White Hart Hotel, where about six sets will be on view.The exhibition will be open to the public for three days.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It#s a really exciting move as it offers the potential to climb the Scottish football pyramid.#From the club#s point of view, we want to find our standard amongst the new teams joining the set up.#We want to be the best we can be as the senior team of the Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.#With our acceptance into the WoSFL, we can offer a pathway for the youngest age groups right through to the under- side, being trained by Stuart Crossan, into our first team, representing Campbeltown in non-league football.#With that, it#s important to acknowledge the huge amount of hard work that has gone into making Campbeltown#s community club a Gold Merit Award holder, one of only seven clubs in the Scottish Football AssociationWest region, encompassing all of Glasgow and the west. This accolade was a major factor in our acceptance into the WoSFL.#Other factors in the Pupils# favour before WoSFL committee scrutiny included having changing facilities for two teams of up to  players each, a separate referee#s room, and an enclosed ground with spectator barriers.Campbell said of the club#s Kintyre Park home: #The renovation of the pavilion is nearing completion, through a fundraising campaign led by club chairman Alex McKinven.#Campbell added: #The SAFL was a great  for us to play competitive amateur football for  years. In periods, we went through some wilderness years but we have happy memories of successful title-winning seasons, too.#In recent seasons, however, the club became disillusioned with how the league was going, with dficulty getting referees and sometimes teams to travel to Kintyre at a week#s notice – this was not a feature against even rival teams in years gone by.#In the WosFL, our geography could not be a determining factor in league entry as we are SFA West region members, which meant that the criteria we could meet on a match day, and the quality of our community club pathway, mattered most.#Meanwhile, the Pupils are gearing up for le in the WoSFL with contact training resuming on Tuesday evening.The team have been training twice weekly in a non-contact setting to build up their base fitness since March.Campbell added: #Training has been well attended, led by coaches Norman Thomson and Lewis Mackay, and although it has been hard to get the players together with ongoing restrictions, the squad are right behind the move and excited about the challenge ahead.#Campbeltown Pupils are keen to hear from anyone who would be able to help with ground and park maintenance. Anyone who feels they are able to help can contact Campbell Robertson, club secretary.For more club updates, follow @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As German troops advanced through Normandy, the st fought valiantly, protecting French citizens, hoping evacuation by sea would be forthcoming.On June  , German tanks surrounded the ision at the French fishing port of St Valéry. This, alongside a curtain of heavy fog, made the long-awaited flotilla rescue unviable and they were forced to surrender. Those who were not killed in the fighting were captured as prisoners of war and marched to camps in Eastern Europe, where they remained for five gruelling years.Following the commemorations to mark the th anniversary of the battle last June, a remarkable story has emerged. One brave soldier miraculously evaded capture and was taken in by a French family who hid him from the occupying German forces.#We were contacted by Monsieur Patrick Prieur, a -year-old St Valéry resident whose grandparents and father remained in the town during the entirety of the war. He told us the story of the escapee and the tragedy that befell him,# said Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland.#As we approach the st anniversary of the battle, we hope to identy this Scottish hero, give him the recognition he deserves and bring peace to his family.#Patrick Prieur recalled the tale his late father told him: #A soldier from the st Highland Division was hidden by a family in the village. They bonded and the family learned he was a married man with a we and two daughters waiting for him tohome.#For several weeks, the soldier remained hidden but, regretfully, he was eventually discovered by German troops and marched through the town to the municipal cemetery.#After being forced to dig his own grave, he was positioned against the cemetery wall and shot. His death deeply upset the townspeople, who had been aware of his hiding, and especially my father, who was only  at the time.#In later years, the Franco-British military cemetery was built and his body was moved there. His grave is marked as #Known unto God# and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.#Monsieur Prieur added: #My father had been gted a piece of paper on which the soldier#s name was written, #Keller Len Scott#, and this became his prized possession. He desperately wanted to find the soldier#s family to tell them what had happened to their beloved and where he was laid to rest, but having very little information, he struggled.#In  my father passed away and, being eager to finish what he started, I recently contacted Poppyscotland and the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association to ask for help.#Michelle McKearnon, head of engagement at the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association, said: #We started to do our own research to unearth the fallen soldier#s identity but only got so far. We believe the name order on the piece of paper may have been written in military fashion, with the surname preceding any given names, so the family name might be Keller.#We#re now at an impasse, struggling to find additional information through our own resources, so we need the knowledge of the wider community to continue our efforts.#Dr Armstrong added: #We are urging anyone who believes they know of or has any information about our #Unknown Soldier#, no matter how small, to get in touch.#This brave man fought valiantly for his country and to repay our debt to him for his service would be an honour, not only for Legion Scotland as custodians of remembrance, but for his family, Monsieur Prieur#s father, the people of St Valéry and, ultimately, for all the #unknown soldiers# who sacriced their lives for us.#Anyone with information that could help identy the soldier should visit poppyscotland.org.uk stvalery"},{"url":null,"title":"engines at the ready mach 1 stages rally gets go ahead","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They did notto the harbour until after pm with the casualty in tow.The following day, Sceptre skipper Tom Smith praised the hard work and efficiency of the Campbeltown leboat crews.Diver Robert Lamont, a member of the leboat crew the night before, went in and removed the damaged rudder ready for Sceptre to be towed by tug to Troon, the finish of the race.The race sails from Oban to Mull, Jura and Arran then Troon, stopping at each island for a team of runners to complete a hill race.Sceptre, with a crew of four, was carrying the boys# team from Glenalmond School, Perth.She had run aground the night before entering Craighouse, Jura. Everything looked fine on the yacht, which was built in Argyll at Alexander Robertson#s Holy Loch yard to compete in the America#s Cup of .#As a precaution, we did not have the boys on board for the tough leg round the Mull of Kintyre to Arran,# said crew member Roger Finbow.#They haven#t missed the race they were on board Blue Damsel, carrying the girls# team.#The decision proved a wise move as not only did the rudder come loose leaving the yacht with no steering, it was flapping wildly and in danger of damaging the hull.As a precaution, the leboat crew put a heavy-duty pump on board but this was not needed.HMS Dragon broke off her sea trials to come to the aid of Sceptre. The Type  Clyde-built destroyer stood by until the leboat arrived.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOCalls were mounting earlier this week for a Scottish Office decision on the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland.The Scottish Office has been considering a business plan for state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne to operate the link with Ballycastle in Northern Ireland since the beginning of February.The company needs Scottish Office permission to become involved in the project.But concern is growing that unless a decision is made soon the necessary harbour work at Campbeltown will not start until it is too late for the service to begin next year.Two Campbeltown ambulance men were among six from Argyll recently presented with long service and good conduct medals by the Duke of Argyll.Ronnie Hamilton and Malcolm Black travelled to Oban for the presentation, carried out by the Duke on behalf of HM Queen.The medals are not awarded automatically but are made on the recommendation of a special .The Duke told the ambulance men: #What you do is not a profession, it is a vocation.#He also paid tribute to their families, pointing out the ambulance men worked anti-social hours for long periods at a time.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown was #switched on# to colour television on Tuesday by the town#s new Provost, William Craig, in his first official engagement.The service has been brought to Campbeltown by Redfusion, the firm which pipes television to several thousand subscribers from its mast at Crosshill Farm.The firm#s Scottish general manager Mr Colin Payne said that Redfusion offers a public service of which they were proud.#We looked at the television problems here. There were just BBC and STV and occasionally Ulster in the town.#We said can we bring to Campbeltown the full range of colour programmes which are available where and the answer to that was #yes#.#There are now six programmes on the system. There aren#t many places in the country which can receive this.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAn English steam liner which called in here for bait one day last week had full bunkers and a plentul reserve of coal in ious corners. She had gone to Ostende for the fuel.A further restriction of the gas supply in the burgh comes into force on Saturday night. The hours during which there will be reduced and normal pressure respectively are given in advertisement.The local branch of the Miners# Union opened a subscription list this week for the purpose of starting a communal soup kitchen. It is not intended, of course, to confine the benefits of the scheme to miners or their dependents. Over £ has already been raised and the committee intend to publish the list of subscriptions next week.A welcome break in our comparative isolation from the mainland was made at the beginning of the week when the steamer Kinloch made a special run to the upper reaches, with mail, passengers and cargo.Many merchants, not only in Campbeltown but at Carradale and the west of Arran ports, were carrying very low stocks and this run was not made a day too soon to prevent absolute scarcity of not a few necessities.Flour, for one thing, was running very short, and the new supplies got by bakers were very much-needed.Alcohol is again tipped as a likely rival to petrol. The new motor fuel is being produced by the Distillers Company Ltd and consists of a mixture of  per cent of alcohol,  per cent of benzole and  per cent of paraffin. The idea of using alcohol is not new, but a fatal obstacle has been the unwillingness of the government to release its hold upon alcohol and permit it to be used for commercial purposes."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and Be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.This week, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulancemarks its eighth anniversary – after a year like no other.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our Helimed crews have never missed a beat maintaining our emergency helicopter air ambulance service across Scotland#s mainland and island communities. In fact we#ve enhanced our service with the launch of a new aircraft – Helimed  in Aberdeen last year – which has already had a huge impact on pre-hospital care in the Grampian, Highland and island regions.In our busiest year ever, our aircrew have endured challenging working conditions, with additional procedures and cumbersome protective and safety equipment as they go about an already dficult and stressful job.But they#re not complaining – this is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I, for one, am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware that we are only able to provide this critical service, thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times. So you are the real heroes in our charity.SCAA is the people#s helicopter – funded by the people of Scotland, for the people of Scotland – and our two frontline aircraft are stood by ready to help you, your family, your friends, colleagues, neighbours or anyone in your community when you most need us.As we mark our eighth birthday on May , we are asking the people of Scotland,they can, to support us into the future. Any donation, however small, to celebrate our anniversary will help to save a le – just like the numerous lives we have already saved over almost , missions.SCAA vows to continue to transform emergency care in Scotland, particularly to our rural and island communities, with your support. Thank you.As a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we congratulate all MSPs on their election and welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.There have been dramatically increased waiting times for mental health treatment during lockdown.In December , for example,  per cent of children and young people had been waiting more than a year for specialist treatment, compared with . per cent in , a truly frightening statistic.A commitment by MSPs to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, must be a priority for this parliament, giving our young people the care and support they need, when they need it.The frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many young people presents a compelling case for a radical new plan for our struggling mental health services and for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This is a crisis we can overcome, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures.At sight loss charity RNIB Scotland, we are concerned the Covid- crisis might have impacted on people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older.We would like to highlight the emotional reassurance and practical help we offer during the coronavirus lockdown and its aftermath.Covid has eclipsed all other health news in the past year but  people still start to lose their sight in Scotland every week. Add to that stress over Covid and the lockdowns and there could be more people needing support and reassurance.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute and the Western Highlands for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as families, friends and carers.Losing your sight can be devastating news to take in.

From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types, providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew.Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and Midsummer#s Day arrives, here are few #must do# jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:CAPTION:June is the perfect month for creating an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.

James VI also came to the Bass in  as a guest of a later Lauder he liked the island so much that he offered to purchase it, but here he was snubbed.During the reign of Charles II, the Bass became a notorious prison, mainly used for the Covenanters.As many as  of these religious dissidents were held on the island, under appalling conditions: there was a well that produced fresh water, but fresh meat was a scarcity and the fishy taste of the seabirds was a torment to the wretched prisoners.In , four Jacobite officers were imprisoned on the Bass but they successfully took over control of the island and ordered the garrison to depart. After reinforcements had been received, they withstood a siege of nearly three years, under trying conditions, before they surrendered with full military honours in May .The Bass later passed into the ownership of the Dalrymple family, to which it still belongs today.The Bass Rock lighthouse was constructed in  by the celebrated engineer David Stevenson, a cousin of Robert Louis. He made sure that parts of the old castle were demolished for the stone to be harvested to build the -metre lighthouse, which served its purpose well for many years to come.It was lit with gas derived from vaporised paraffin oil for many years, monitored by the lighthouse keeper.Since , when the lighthouse was converted to electricity and remotely controlled, the lighthouse keeper was no longer needed, and the Bass Rock has been without any permanent human resident.From his house lsquoRockstowesrsquo on Melbourne Road, the celebrated postcard artist Reginald Phillimore enjoyed uninterrupted views of the Bass Rock.He had a fascination with the island, visited it many times and wrote a guidebook that he published himself.The Bass Rock is home to the largest gannet colony in the world: , birds spend their summer residence here, having been in Africa for the winter.The gannet, or lsquosolan goosersquo as it was known in Phillimorersquos time, is a large and formidable-looking seabird, with a white body, a yellow neck and head, and black and white speckled wings and tail.The reason that much of the Bass Rock appears white from a distance is the sheer number of birds and their acrid droppings.The gannet hunts fish by ing headlong into the sea, as any visitor to the Bass Rock can observe at close range.The air is full of birds, which are squawking cacophonously, and the smell from their droppings is very noticeable.Phillimore made some beautul postcards featuring the Bass Rock gannets he is likely to have travelled to the island from Canty Bay or on a vessel from North Berwick, but nowadays access to the Bass can be arranged via the Scottish Seabird Centre.This is an edited extract from Jan Bondesonrsquos book R.P.

With Children.\"She [Rebel] is like me, in that Ive been a working mum my whole le,\" says the -year old, who is married to Kurt Sutter, her third husband and Sons of Anarchy co-star .\"I am a much better mumIm a working mum, and I would not know how to sacrice one of them - and shes the same.\"Shes got this huge drive and passion for what she does, she also has children and loves them, and it gets messy and somebody gets neglected.\"In the series you see the repercussions on her older kids, and theyll complain about her - that she didnt spend enough time with them and she didnt make it to school s and she didnt do all that.\"But, at the same time, the two older children go into service work: ones a doctor, ones a lawyer, and theyre fighting the good fight. So, you see how it [Rebels work] kind of rubbed off on them.\"Also starring John Corbett, Tamala Jones and Andy Garcia, the series follows the \"funny, fearless, brilliant\" Rebel, and her work as a blue-collar legal advocate without a law degree.When Rebel applies herself to a fight she believes in, she will win at almost any cost.It feels notably rare still to see \"messy\" women like this on screen, and Sagal loves playing someone whos flawed.\"She is not perfect, by any means, and you get to see a three-dimensional person thats trying to juggle everything,\" elaborates the actress.\"And she orders a lot of people around - shes not always polite. Shes just kind of in your face. She thinks shes right and you have to do what she says.\"Empowering lead characters aside, what was it about this script that stood out for Sagal \"I was very energised by the creator of the show, Krista [Vernoff]. And when I knew that it was inspired by Erin Brockovich - it wasnt her le, because we dont have her le rights - I was immediately interested in that because I love what she does.\"Another draw was that Sagal knew the team behind Rebel wanted her she was actually approached and asked to play the part, she reveals.And it sounds as though it was a no-brainer to say yes.\"I love that shes working for something,\" she follows. \"I like that it means something.\"As an entertainer, I look at the whole thing as helping people, really. And then to have subject matter that actually gives voice to helping people... I dont think people necessarily need to watch television because of that but for me, personally, to be able to be saying something is important to me. So, all of that attracted me to it.\"Also, shes very dferent to me. People think just because Ive played a lot of badass characters that I am that way, but Im really not. So, thats always fun for me to be in that position.\"As part of her preparation for the role, Sagal met Brockovich, who is now in her sixties, a couple of times.She recalls having lunch with her and Vernoff, and how they all \"just got on so well\".Being able to pick up on the activists vibe informed her work on the show, she explains, as the lunch quickly \"became like a sort of girls chat\".\"I understood who she was just sitting there with her. She talks very passionately and very quickly - and shes very smart and funny.\"There is a lovely warmth that radiates from Sagal, even though the interview is through a screen, over a Zoom call.As well as an impressively ied acting career, she is also known as a singer-songwriter she worked as a backing vocalist for the likes of Bob Dylan and Etta James, was a member of Bette Midlers backup group, The Harlettes, and she still performs on stage today.\"I love to play music,\" she enthuses. \"Now its so in the right place in my le because I dont rely on music, but I have my band. We go out and play and have fun.\"We end our chat discussing what Sagal has learned about herself from making Rebel, and she muses on how all roles allow an \"inner something to be released\".In the case of Rebel, \"she gets angry a lot in the name of something righteous\" - something the star has obviously enjoyed getting her teeth into, from the way she smiles playfully when talking about the emotionally-charged scenes.\"Its so great to be able to scream and yell at somebody,\" she admits. \"And she doesnt censor herself. As a human being, I think Im a little more diplomatic, Im a little more concerned with what other people think I struggle with a lot of that. She doesnt care what you think.\"She knows that shes in the right world, she knows what she believes in and shell just let it fly - and theres something very liberating about that.\"Rebel premieres exclusively on Disney+ on Friday"},{"url":null,"title":"gardening-safe-plant-tender-veg","story":"Gardening: When is it safe to plant out tender veg Tomatoes and chillies in a bowIts just about time to plant out tender veg safely - or is it The rise and fall of temperatures this spring - April started off warm and dry, but ended up being the frostiest April in  years - has left some gardeners in a quandary about when to plant out their tender edibles, including courgettes, tomatoes and chillies.Gardening expert, bestselling author and presenter, Alys Fowler, says that a handful of tender crops need to bake in warm conditions, and sulkthey are subjected to cold and wet.\"Chillies, tomatoes and aubergines should have already been sown, although you could get away with sowing courgettes and possibly sweetcorn in mid-May,\" says Fowler, whose new book Eat What You Grow offers a wealth of advice on growing fruit and veg.As a general rule, tender plants that have been sown indoors can be taken outside between mid-May and early June, depending on where you live, but only when all danger of frost has passed.Tender plants will need to be hardened off - acclimatised gradually and with protection, whether it be a cold frame, greenhouse, sheltered porch or under a cloche, she advises.Tomatoes\"To have good tomato growth you need night-time temperatures to remain above  degrees, and preferably -C. The cold spring doesnt mean they cant go outside, but they really do need to be protected.\"They need to be in a patio greenhouse, or something like that. You can use a cold frame but really the best tomatoes are grown in a greenhouse in this country.\"Growing them outside means you are growing them really late and you wont get tomatoes until September. They need heat and sun to ripen. Dont expect to be eating them in June.\"Some ieties are better for growing outside, such as Gardeners Delight, Kenilworth and Matts Wild Cherry.\"She says hardening off takes two or three weeks, and dont just turf them out on a really sunny day, as the change in conditions can cause the plants stress and they may wilt as they try to adjust.Top tip: \"The more room that you give your tomatoes, the better they will grow. Put them in the biggest pot you possibly can. The more root mass, the healthier the plant. And as soon as you see the flowers, start feeding the plant every week.\"Chillies\"Chillies are like tomatoes, they really need heat. They come from South America and want to bask in the heat. A good place to grow them is on your windowsill, butyou are growing them outside, it needs to be a really sheltered, sunny spot like a sunny courtyard or patio.\"They make a lovely houseplant, although some grow to ft, while others are really small such as Prairie Fire, which would work on a windowsill. The chillies start off yellow and ripen to bright red.\"She notes that chillies are hungry, so will need potting on a lot more regularly than tomatoes, in fact every time the roots stick out of the bottom of the drainage holes, youll need to pot them on. And once flowers appear, feed them weekly, she advises.Top tip: \"Some ieties produce a king chilli, which is the first fruit which appears on the first axis of the plant. Take it off, otherwise it will prevent further flowering by concentrating a lot of the growth into this single fruit.\"Courgettes\"Put them out too early and you may get lots of male flowers when its cold, which will mean flowers and no courgettes, which is frustrating. The only thing to do is wait for it to warm up.\"Courgettes are big plants and people tend to put them slightly too close together. They really are better .-ft apart.\"Top tip: \"Keep picking them when they are small and they will keep producing. If you let them grow into marrows they start to think that the end of their days are coming and they wont produce so many.\"Sweetcorn\"If you havent sown it already, you can still sow sweetcorn in May, preferably indoors in pots. The minute theyve got to a good size - thicker than a pencil - get them in the ground when all danger of frost has passed.\"They are wind-pollinated, so you need to plant them in a block so that you raise the chances of the pollen hitting a neighbour. Plant them between - inches apart ideally. They dont need staking but keep them out of a direct wind tunnel.\"Sweetcorn are easy to grow but they will need a fairly good summer to produce good cobs.\"Top tip: \"If you think theyre getting rocked about too much, you can draw up the soil around the base.\"Eat What You Grow by Alys Fowler is published by Kyle Books, priced pound.

But even as businesses contemplate reopening they must remember that change is unsettling and ato \"normal\" may feel anything but to employees.Throughout lockdown, we carried out surveys to gauge how clients saw their businesses changing as restrictions tightened. And now, as they ease, many businesses acknowledge that office le will undergo signicant change.Accommodating flexible working means some fundamental aspects might be lost and others added. Hygiene stations and \"Zoom spaces\" are set to become part of office design, but the days of personal desks for every employee are numbered. And while this is a logical approach to flexible working, the wise business will bring their employees with them on the change journey, before implementing it.Physical space has to support, and be aligned with, new working practices, rather than the other way round. Whether existing space is reconfigured or new offices acquired, it is vital to engage with employees on how best to use the new space to reduce old working practices or workarounds creeping back in.We love our own desks, but our experience is that inidual desk \"ownership\" leads to a lot of empty desks. The loss of a space to call your own can be unsettling for iniduals, no matter how logical it might be for the business as a whole. Thought and consultation is needed to make \"hot-desking\" accepted. Some solutions might include personal storage or locker spaces, appropriate portable technology and providing smaller, more flexible private spaces where telephone calls or remote meetings can take place without disruption.Numerous figures have been reported with regards to future space requirementand some organisations have declared the end of the office altogether, stating that their people can work from home indefinitely. Time will tell what the actual change will be.One thing cannot be denied. People want to get back to their offices primarily to interact once more with their colleagues. The informal knowledge-sharing that comes from everyone sharing a workspace cannot be replicated through remote links alone. The sense of belonging that comes from feeling part of something bigger, and an understanding of a business culture and ethos relies on observation and interaction. This is especially true for new starts and junior staff.Physical workspace changes, which might be cost-saving can have other costs in terms of workplace happiness and productivity. So as workplaces open, the transition will ultimately be so much better for those companies that make spatial design decisions that support how their employees want to work, bring staff into the change process and not impose it upon them.Phil Muir is Group Director Consultancy and Design, SPACE"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12623330.jpg?type=article-full","title":"kevin-mckenna-cummings-statements-reveal-covid-19-response-shambolic","story":"THE question by Rebecca Long-Bailey in todayrsquos evidence session of the Health and Social Care Committee cut to the heart of the UKrsquos shambolic response to Coronavirus.The Labour MP asked Dominic Cummings about his tweet last week that pointed to ldquodestructive behaviour in the political system.

The whole thing takes a skilled person about eight hours at least.The problem ndash and itrsquos the same with sporrans ndash is there are lots of cheap imports around, which has put the traditional craft under pressure.

The kilt has never been so ubiquitous, but maybe a lot of men think the lighter, cheaper kilt is easier to wear and lug about. The cost of a hand-made kilt can also be daunting ndash these days, you can easily pay more than pound,.The other problem with kilts is that,you do get one, it comes with a lot of baggage and attitude, some of which is a load of rubbish. For many, the kilt is the standardised vision of Scotland, but they werenrsquot always so common. My parents married in the s and it didnrsquot even cross my fatherrsquos mind to wear a kilt. I also spoke to the historian Patrick Watt about tartan and his experience was similar.

But all Irsquod say to that is: check your history. It may not be true, as some people think, that Highland dress was invented by Walter Scott, but the modern romantic image was popularised and spread by Queen Victoria.

A key witness eager to unburden himself and point the finger on an issue with the highest possible stakes. We will not see its like again for some time, I bet.Parliamentary committees, whether examining government departments or poring over legislation, are rarely so compelling. Especially at Holyrood.One of the interesting dferences between yesterdayrsquos session and the typical Scottish Parliament offering was who was in charge.:Cummings paints surreal picture of goings-on at dysal Number  ndash Westminster sketchOpening the questions and setting the tone of blunt inquiry was Greg Clark, a minister from the outset of the Toriesto power in , who held two cabinet posts and is now chair of the Commons science and technology select committee.The other lead inquisitor was Jeremy Hunt, a three-time cabinet secretary from  to  who now chairs the health and social care committee.It is not unusual for former big beasts to chair select committees, posts that are not only elected by MPs, conferring authority, but are remunerated at pound, a year, so the occupants have to earn their keep.It helps maintain the tradition of independent-minded scrutiny, even by MPs of the governing party.The experience former ministers bring to the job is also invaluable as they know best how the system works and how best to penetrate the wiles and evasions of officialdom.Both Mr Clark and Mr Hunt are Tories perfectly willing to make le hard for a Tory Prime Minister.Yes, both were Remainers ousted in Boris Johnsonrsquos first reshuffle, so there may be personal factors at play, but they are still part of a healthier-than-Holyrood system where loyalty to onersquos party is not paramount.Meanwhile in Edinburgh, it is rare for recent ministers to be committee conveners, and rarer still for former cabinet secretaries to take on the role.In the - Scottish parliament, there were only three former SNP ministers who led committees, and only two in the - session, when one former cabinet secretary also fleetingly took charge of a committee for two recess months one year.In Westminster, committee chair is a perfectly respectable afterle for a former minister or cabinet secretary, with remuneration offering lsquojam todayrsquo to make up for the workload.Holyrood is quite dferent. Conveners are not elected by the parliament as a whole, but by the MSPs on each committee.:Battle royal looms as William and Kate deployed to bolster the UnionWith parties choosing which MSPs go where, it gives the government of the day a huge say in who gets many of the gigs, and naturally it has no wish to implant thorns in its own side.Convenerships are very often the stepping stones to ministerial office.There is no remuneration for the considerable amount of extra graft.Instead, there is the lure of lsquojam tomorrowrsquo in the form of promotion.That incentivises loyalty to the government and not causing a fuss.Other MSPs of the governing party follow this example. Mavericks, such as Alex Neil, are welcome but rare.Holyroodrsquos committee system was famously supposed to be the jewel in its crown, offering the scrutiny of a second chamber without the cost.But as we enter a sixth parliamentary term, its clear theyrsquove been a let-down, arguably reaching their nadir in the gutless toadying from some SNP MSPs during the Alex Salmond inquiry.Some problems come down to the parliamentrsquos size. The talent pool is more paddling than ing.Even with the SNP having close to a majority, around a fth of all MSPs are part of the government, and so unavailable for committee duty.Infrequent reshuffles mean a low turnover in ministers, so government experience is lacking among the rest.The present First Ministerrsquos habit of re-hiring old hands also leaves former ministers who are on committees wonderingthey might one day , so best to bite their tongue.There have been many tinkering attempts at reform. In , then Presiding Officer Tricia Marwick asked the Standards Committee to investigate the case for elected conveners, an idea she supported.ldquoIf conveners were elected by the whole Parliament, they would derive their authority and mandate from the Parliament itself, she said.ldquoThis sht of responsibility... would strengthen the role of the Parliament and so enhance the sharing of power between the government, the Parliament and the people.The Committee preferred fudge, concluding the Parliament ldquoshould set aside the idea on elected conveners and discuss general scrutiny instead.The next PO, Ken Macintosh, tried again, establishing an independent commission on parliamentary reform to help improve scrutiny.It backed elected conveners, with procedures in place from the start of the current session, with potential remuneration based on workload.The committees have yet to be formed for this session, but there is no sign yet of any elections or pay bumps.Instead, it looks like the same old patronage and pusillanimity.Nicola Sturgeon yesterday promised ldquounashamedly ambitious policies for the coming term, while priding herself on Holyrood not transplanting ldquothe old ways of Westminster.But grand plans merit deep scrutiny and Holyrood doesnrsquot offer it.ldquoWe do not claim a monopoly of wisdom, the First Minister added.In that case,some Westminster ways are worth importing, do it."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12647717.jpg?type=article-full","title":"glasgow-road-closures-announced-cop26-summit","story":"Details of roads close to the event at the citys SEC campus have been released for the first time along with a map.It comes as businesses are being invited to sign-up for an event to find out about the work being done to prepare Glasgow for the arrival COP.The virtual event is being organised as part of the Get Ready Glasgow campaign developed by Glasgow City Council in partnership with event organisers - the UK Government, and with Police Scotland and Glasgow Chamber of Commerce.Read more:Scotlands covid memorial campaign boosted by trust fund donationAs host city of this potentially historic climate change summit, Glasgow is in a position to raise its profile globally as a sustainable city, attract investment to key sectors and promote itself as a visitor destination.Get Ready Glasgow campaign is aimed at keeping the city moving and open for business in the lead up to and during the COP conference.It will also be used to make sure the city is prepared to welcome visitors and that citizens feel confident and reassured about Glasgow hosting a covid-safe event.The event comes as details of the impact of the conference on this cityrsquos road network around the main venue, the SEC, and river restrictions are announced.

Instead, the decoration and design suggests that it is a piece of Central Asian metalwork from halfway round the known world.ldquoWhat was revealed was decoration that is unlike the other two, they were made in a Christian context in the Carolingian empire probably sometime in the th century AD.ldquoOur vessel has non-Christian symbolism on it and in particular there is a central icon which is a Zoroastrian fire altar and Zoroastrianismwas the state religion of the Sassanian empire, which is much further to the east in central Asia, what was Persia and is modern day Iran, and there are leopards and tigers in the vegetation on the vessel and the whole thing just has a much dferent symbolism.ldquoIt was quite a surprise, itrsquos really opened up that international picture.Dr Chris Breward, director of NMS, described the hoard as ldquoprobably the most signicant find from the period of the Vikings in Britain or Ireland that we know of.The exhibition, which opens on Saturday, shows how the hoard was buried in four distinct parcels ndash two of silver bullion and one a cluster of four elaborately-decorated silver ldquoribbon arm-rings bound together and concealing a small wooden box containing three items of gold.:poundm grant will help unwrap Viking hoard secretsThe final parcel was a lidded, silver gilt vessel wrapped in layers of textile and packed full of carefully wrapped objects that appear to have been curated like relics or heirlooms.They include beads, pendants, brooches, bracelets, an elaborate belt-set, a rock crystal jar and other curios, often strung or wrapped with silk, as well as two mysterious balls of dirt containing tiny specks of gold.The beads found in the containerThese balls are similar to other lumps of earth preserved by the Vatican archives, purported to have been dug up by pilgrims in the Holy Land of the Middle East and brought back to Europe.Samples of the actual ground Jesus and the apostles walked on would have been considered holy relics, explaning why they were secreted away among other more obvious valuables.It is not known why the hoard, which had items belonging to four owners, was buried, though they were typically hidden by people under threat or stress who hoped to reclaim them later.Research into the hoard, found by metal detectorist Derek McLennan, continues through a pound million project led by NMS in partnership with the University of Glasgow.The exhibition Galloway Hoard: Viking-age Treasure will be open at the National Museum of Scotland in Chambers Street, Edinburgh, until September  when it will then tour to Kirkcudbright Galleries and Aberdeen Art Gallery."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-anyone-brave-enough-scotlands-dominic-cummings","story":"My final thought on the questioning, however, is a fervent wish that there is a whistle blower somewhere in the Scottish administration also someone with Mr Cummingsrsquos breadth of knowledge of what was going on, who can supply the people of Scotland with the background to, for example, the inexplicable transfer of the old and vulnerable from hospitals to care homes where many died as a result, and many other matters that need investigation and disclosure.

Well, that is something that anyone who follows politics in Scotland knew in advance.As the SNPrsquos grip on power slips a little it reaches out for a lebelt and finds it in the form of the Green Party.The First Minister seemed pleased with herself as she made the announcement, but maybe she should ponder on the decision a little longer, for I am sure that many genuine Green voters will not be very enamoured at being used as political pawns.W MacIntyre, East Kilbride.LET TORIES SHOW SOME COMPASSIONFURTHER to Dr Douglas Pitts plea to ease up on anti-Tory dogma , I would say that this will be accomplished as soon as Conservatives display some compassion, empathy, sympathy, kindness, pity, humanity, instead of their usual arrogance, scorn, egoism, conceit, disdain. I refer him to a Prime Minister who would prefer to spend untold thousands on decorating his living room,than on feeding children during school holidays.Margaret Forbes, Kilmacolm.THE LOGIC IS WITH THE YES SIDEI WAS lucky enough to have had a letter advocating home rule for our island communities published some time ago, so I welcome Brian Wilsons devolution ldquoawakening, as he has been a fanatical opponent of that policy for decades . As he states, it is a liberating experience for culture, self-reliance and the economy.I trust,he follows his own logic, that he will be on the Yes side for indyref, when full devolution for Scotland is on the ballot.GR Weir, Ochiltree.WILLIAM AND KATE SERVE US WELLTHERE was not much need for Rosemary Goringrsquos infantile spite about the Earl of Strathearnrsquos tour of Scotland in the company of the Countess The man is Lord High Commissioner this year to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, an office his aunt has also performed. Their family have homes in Scotland.The Earls grandmother is head of state in Scotland and might remain so in the event of independence, so itrsquos nonsense to moan about the constitution in relation to this stravaig.The Earl and Countess are doing what the Queen and her representatives have always done, encouraging, participating, listening and helping. Itrsquos what those people are paid for. The Earlrsquos grandfather was appreciated for doing the like and was an energetic organiser of programmes of help and development.Itrsquos not necessary to be either a unionist or a monarchist to recognise that the Earl and Countess are doing their job with flair and engagement. If Ms Goringrsquos problem is one of institutional scale and cost, itrsquos worth mentioning that the royal brand earns millions for the Exchequer.Itrsquos perfectly legitimate to want a dferent kind of constitution. But some features of democracy may be the things that need improving. And genuine republicans have respect for the consent of most people in allegiance to high heid yins.Perhaps Ms Goring believes the recent visit of the Earl and Countess to the Republic of Ireland was sinister imperial diplomacy.Tim Cox, Switzerland.ANCIENT GRIEVANCESWITH a tenuous link between Henry VIIIrsquos \"rough wooing\" to what she sees as a modern-day charm offensive on the part of current royals, Rosemary Goring reminds us that some nationalist grievances can still be deployed eventhey are nearly  years old.At this time when we have all been facing inidually and collectively some of the toughest times in recent memory, many will draw comfort from the compassion and genuine concern expressed by the royal couple as they go about their work. They seek to encourage us all and recognise the commitment of those who have helped others through the worst of times.Yet with breathtaking cynicism, Ms Goring chooses to dismiss the Earl of Strathearn as ldquoa Trojan horse to convey a message of unity. Some, it seems, can find grievance in every act, word and gesture.Keith Howell, West Linton.Read more: Lockdown delay blame lies in London, not Edinburgh"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12651093.jpg?type=article-full","title":"brexit-uk-told-stay-scottish-bid-stay-erasmus","story":"In a major report, the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Committeealso says Britainrsquos Turing scheme, which replaced Erasmus, should be expanded so it funds inward bound international students and opportunities for academic staff.Last night, Jamie Hepburn, the new Minister for Higher and Further Education, branded Turing a \"watered-down imitation\" of the blocsprogramme and warneditwould reduce opportunities for students and faculty. He also said the Scottish Government was continuing to explore ways of improvingaccessto the EU scheme.However, the UK Government insisted the decision to end participation was based on securing value for taxpayers.The SAC analysis explores a wide range of issues facing higher education, including Brexit, the impact of Covid-, income pressures, risks arising from immigration policy, and ensuring institutions are adequately represented within the UK Research and Innovation funding body.:Support for moves to protect Scotlands participationin ErasmusPete Wishart, SAC chairman, said: ldquoThis is a crunch time for Scottish universities and improved collaboration and engagement on reserved issues is the key to ensuring the wellbeing of our university sector.ldquoThe reputation of Scottish universities and the research they conduct is nothing short of world class. But they face challenges made more dficult by Brexit and coronavirus.\"Getting the policiesimpacting right will help them through this rough patch and strengthen the foundations of higher education and research.Ending UK participation in Erasmus has proved controversial north of the Border, with the SAC report noting that ministers and academics here lobbied for Scotland to remain in the scheme. Such involvement was opposed by the British Government, it adds.Earlier this year, Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, also rejected the idea, telling MEPs that, as a ldquoconstituent nation of the UK, Scotland could not be granted separate association.Pete Wishart is Chair of the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Committee.Nevertheless, the SNP manesto published before this monthrsquos Holyrood election says the party will ldquocontinue to advocate for Scotlandrsquos inclusion while also pursuing the creation of a ldquoScottish programme of exchange.The SACrsquos report states: ldquoThe Scottish Government has indicated a desire to remain in the Erasmus+ programme. ldquoShould they decide to continue down this path and be willing to cover the associated costs, and should the EU consent to Scottish participation, the UK Government should not block this endeavour .While acknowledging that Turing is expected to benefit more than twice as many UK students as Erasmus+ for the one year currently funded, SAC members also note the British programme will not support inward placements.ldquoWe recommend not only that the scheme continue with at least the same level of funding in future years, but that it be expanded to incorporate the funding of international student and academic staff placements to the UK, the report adds.Another area of concern is overreliance on international student fees following a  per cent realterms decrease in public sector money over seven years.:EU chief closes door on separate Scottish participation in ErasmusldquoThe Scottish Government and Scottish universities should work with the UK Government and universities in other parts of the UK to seek out examples of best practice in ersying income streams away from potentially volatile international student fees, the report states.ldquoIn doing so great care should be taken to ensure that core focus on education and research is not lost in favour of commercialised corporate ventures.MPs also want to see new scholarships for EU students and lower visa costs for researchers.Universities Scotland director Alastair Sim said: ldquoThe report makes clear that by working together, the UK and Scottish governments can support Scotlandrsquos universities.ldquoWe hope both governments take the time to respond and ensure that Scottish universities can make the most of their potential, be that on immigration policies at Westminster or sustainable funding at Holyrood.Jamie Hepburn is Scotlands new Minister for Higher and Further Education.Mary Senior, the UCUrsquos Scotland official, said: ldquoThe report makes some useful observations, especially on the shortcomings of the new Turing scheme, and the need for an immigration system which works for the university sector in Scotland.ldquoThe report recognises that Turing is not the reciprocal exchange scheme enabling students and staff to live study or work overseas in the same way as Erasmus, and urges the UK Government to address that.A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ldquoThe UK Government decided to not participate in the next Erasmus+ programme as it was not in the interest of UK taxpayers and our net contribution would have been around pound billion.\"The new global Turing Scheme, backed by pound million, will provide thousands of students across all of the UK with the opportunity to study and work abroad.ldquoWe will continue to work with the sector and devolved administrations to deliver the programme.\":Fears over delayed university offersMr Hepburn said: ldquoThe UK Governmentrsquos decision to not participate in Erasmus+is hugely disappointinganddirectly impacts Scottish students and staff, who have benefited enormously from the programme.\"The Turing scheme is a watered-down imitation of Erasmus+ which will see support for our most disadvantaged learners cut, and opportunities for all our students, staff and young people reduced.ldquoWe continue to explore with the institutions of the European Union how we can improve Scotlandrsquos access to this vital programme. We recognise the importance of reciprocal educational mobility exchange and will announce further steps in due course.\"He added: ldquoUniversities are autonomous institutions with responsibility for decisions relating to their own operational matters.

Restoring, re-energising, not grandstanding or issuing threats or warnings. vw,vw,px, px\"First Minister Arlene Foster ldquoOur institutions are not a bargaining chip in our campaign to get rid of the protocol.ldquoWe will consistently roll back the objectional provisions of the protocol, as we have been doing.ldquoThat involves arguing our case forcefullyand with conviction. It involves making Brussels and Dublin aware that the protocol is intolerable and unworkable.ldquoLegal challenges are one correct tactic, but the guaranteed way of reading our sales of the isive protocol is through the Assembly.He added: ldquoWe will employ political tactics to continue the pressure, and let Dublin see that isnrsquot some hiccup, but rather something that has the worrying capacity to destabilise relationships that they have gained most from.Mr Poots said his challenge was to encourage supporters of unionism to get out and vote.He said: ldquoBy far the biggest enemy is those unionists who do not care enough to come out and vote. We must be the Unionist party that inspires them to reengage and get out to vote.Mr Poots called for a ldquounited unionist coalition ahead of the next Assembly elections.He said the only way of preventing a border poll and getting rid of the protocol was by securing a Unionist majority at the next election.In signs of growing isions in the party, outgoing leader Arlene Foster left before Mr Poots took to the stand to make his inaugural speech as leader, as did other senior figures including Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Gavin Robinson, Diane Dodds and Gregory Campbell.Paul Bell, a DUP member of  years from Ms Fosterrsquos Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency, dramatically resigned from the party after Mr Pootsrsquo ratication.He hit out at those who ousted the First Minister, and warned the party stands to lose thousands of votes at the next election.ldquoThis is going to be a real problem for the DUP. The votes that are going to be shed by the DUP is not in their hundreds, itrsquos in their thousands. Itrsquos in their tens of thousands, he said.ldquoWe cannot go round the doors, the people in Fermanagh and South Tyrone will vote for anyone but the DUP. That is because, not of an election, that is because of what took place before the election. vw,vw,px, px\"Edwin Poots speaks to the media, after leaving the Crowne Plaza Hotel, Belfast on the evening he was ratied as the new DUP leader Asked about Mr Bellrsquos resignation, Mr Poots said: ldquoSometimes people donrsquot like the outcome and they do things in the heat of the moment.In his speech, Mr Poots paid tribute to Ms Fosterrsquos leadership of the party.He said: ldquoI want to take an opportunity also to pay tribute to my predecessor.ldquoI know that the last few weeks has been dficult for her, as they have been for all of us.ldquoBut I canrsquot say honestly that no matter what background or place we come from, Arlene is and will be regarded as one of the most foremost women and unionists in British politics.ldquoIrrespective of our dferences in any issues that have brought us here this evening, she is admired by us all.ldquoShe has made history, and her time in politics. I have no doubt she will go on to do even greater things. History will ultimately be kind to her in its final analysis. I wish her and her family well.It comes after the DUP Fermanagh and Tyrone Association released a statement expressing its ldquodisgust at the treatment of outgoing leader Mrs Foster.Mrs Foster announced her resignation as First Minister and DUP leader last month following an internal revolt against her leadership.Four weeks on, Mrs Foster this week said she has still not had sight of a letter reportedly signed by party colleagues asking her to step aside.#STATEMENT #Fermanagh and South Tyrone DUP Association met this week to voice their disgust at the manner in which ourhellipPosted by DUP Fermanagh and South Tyrone onWednesday, May , Fermanagh and Tyrone DUP Association posted a statement on its Facebook page ndash shared by MP Gavin Robinson ndash which stated the treatment of Mrs Foster ldquowas not done in our name and pledged to ldquostand firm by her side.Mrs Foster said she would step down as DUP leader on Friday and as First Minister at the end of June.Mr Poots has signalled that he will become the first DUP leader not to take the First Minister position at Stormont, and will instead nominate a colleague in order to focus on the job of leading the party.MLAs Mervyn Storey and Paul Givan are reportedly being considered for the post.copy -.

This month, a group of people from around the country have decided to make their work-outs matter for those who need it most, by running in support of international relief development charity, Tearfund.Saraand Ricardo will be running km each day while currently teaching in Malaysia. Sara teaches Reception-aged children and Ricardo teaches maths to secondary students. “Running in Malaysia has certainly been hot, humid and sweaty’, Sara says, “But it is a worthy challenge. My husband and I dont run regularly so it has been good to spend time working on our stamina, especially in a hot climate. “Running has also many mental health benefits and as we are in Lockdown # here in Malaysia, it is good to get outside and go for a run to clear the head.”The pair have been in Malaysia since .The group of  members is together covering the distance between Belfast and the very tip of North Africa - , kms, over the month of May. Running mainly in Northern Ireland with a few international participants in Malaysia, Lincolnshire and Geneva, they hope to raise pound, for Tearfund - which could help up to , families living in poverty with health and hygiene training and food support as they await safe access to a Covid-vaccine.Millions of people in Northern Ireland are now partially or fully vaccinated. But for billions of people around the world, a vaccine is still a long way off. It is estimated that amongst people living in poverty, only  in  will access a safe vaccine this year with most others having to wait until next year or even  before they are able to.Sara says, ‘Covid- has affected so many people around the world in many dferent ways. From the loss of jobs to the loss of loved ones, it has been a very dficult time for many. “We are both fortunate that we have been able to work from home and that our families are safe. We feel it is so important to help others in need, especially during this dficult time. “To raise money for food to feed families and to support those in need of imminent healthcare is something we should all consider doingwe can.’Glen Mitchell, Tearfund’s NI Director, says: “We talk about the pandemic being a storm we are all experiencing, but in very dferent boats. This inequality has never been more evident than when it comes to the access to Covid- vaccines.AMPLE DOSES“Those of us who live in countries with enough resource to purchase ample doses of the vaccine are often also those who can afford to social distance and freely access things like clean water or soap. “For many people living in poverty, going to work in crowded spaces is their only chance at putting food on the table for their families. Still others, in refugee camps for example, have no way of isolating. “Many others have to walk for miles in order to access clean water, which they then have to ration through the day,’ he added.“Tearfunds core values are centred around compassion and being servant-hearted,” notes Sara.“The work that they have done and continue to do to help those in poverty or in the face of natural disasters is humbling. “We had heard of the km a day in May challenge through word of mouth and wanted to be part of it to help families. “To know that pound can provide a family with health and hygiene training and food support for  months whilst they wait for the vaccine, really motivated us to jump on board and do our bit to help!“For over  years, Tearfund has walked alongside communities around the world as they respond to disasters, including supporting people living with HIV and those affected by recent Ebola outbreaks. Tearfund helps communities to recover and create a more resilient new normal’. VULNERABLE“And now, Tearfund is working through local partners in more than  countries where the most vulnerable people need help with emergency food and hygiene supplies before, during and after Covid- vaccines become available. “Tearfund is playing a vital role by preventing the spread of the virus through improved hygiene and sanitation and supporting our locally based partners and churches to m“ake a meaningful, sustained response. While people are waiting for access to the vaccination, it is important to act to mitigate the spread of the virus and its impacts.The aid and development organisation is also working to spread accurate information about Covid- vaccines. ‘Alongside our work tackling poverty, we are also helping church leaders and organisations to use their influence to build a good understanding of the Covid- vaccines and help shape and support vaccination programmes that are good for society, particularly the most vulnerable and marginalised.”From the support she and Ricardo have received, Sara is encouraged: “We have been blown away by the generosity of our friends and family during our km a day in May challenge. “It has also been great to be part of a community with others who are also completing the challenge. “The simple words of encouragement and opportunity for accountability with pictures and Strava screenshots has really helped to spur us both on each day for our next run. “The Tearfund staff have provided helpful tips and cheered us on every step of the way!”To make a donation in support of Tearfund’s work responding to coronavirus around the world and support Sara and Ricardo’s running challenge, visit their Justgiving page at https:justgiving fundraising Sara-Braganza.

Destinations include Portugal, Israel, Iceland, Australia and New Zealand.However, today’s poll reveals many are still deeply reluctant to hop on a plane abroad any time soon.People were asked, once vaccinated, when they would consider a foreign holiday.Just % said they plan to head away in  — % may travel this summer while another % would consider an overseas trip later in the year.The vast majority , said it would be next year before they think about going abroad.Another % said it would be two or three years before a trip outside the UK or Ireland, while % have no plans to go overseas at any point.The remaining % were unsure or had no firm opinion.Fewer older people are willing to consider overseas travel this year. Just % would consider doing so — % this summer and % at any point this year. More than halfsaid it would be next year before they consider jetting off, while % would leave it two or three years.By contrast, almost halfof  to  year olds are considering heading overseas this year — with % hoping to get away in the next few months and % later in the year. Another % will leave it to . Broken down by gender, males of any age are more willing to take a trip abroad — % plan to do so this summer and a further % will at some point in . Another % said it would be next year.However, just over a quarter of females plan to holiday abroad in  — % this summer and % this year. Some % plan to leave trips to .It comes as a public health expert from Belfast warned against summer holidays — despite the traffic light system for foreign travel.Professor Gabriel Scally told holidaymakers to “beware” and also warned it is “irresponsible” to travel to other countries while potentially infected with a dangerous iant.Prof Scally, a member of independent Sage, said: “The regional director of the World Health Organization in Europe issued a statement in the last couple of days saying there shouldn’t be international travel and I would agree with that.“It is undesirable to have people holidaying in international resorts at this time for all sorts of reasons.“It isn’t necessarily safe to travel on airplanes, there was a flight between India and Hong Kong and there were  infections and they were only picked up because of quarantine in Hong Kong.“Flights are dficult, but it isn’t just the flights, it’s what happens at arrivals and departures with queues of people in restricted spaces.“You also have lots of people from dferent countries mixing together at foreign resorts.“If you think back a year, the virus came to the UK and Republic of Ireland by people ing from holidays.”He continued: “It’s important to remember that the vaccine isn’t the cure all.“There’s always the risk posed by iants and it’s irresponsible to go off to another country and potentially take a dangerous iant with you.”Prof Scally also criticised the traffic light system, saying: “We need a proper managed quarantine system for everyone arriving into the country.”The Department of Health and the Executive were contacted for comment.Yesterday an airline industry chief said people who have received both doses of the Covid- vaccine should not face restrictions when travelling to countries on the Government’s amber list.Willie Walsh, director-general of airline body Iata, said people should be allowed to make up their own minds about the risks of travelling to amber list destinationsthey have received their jabs.Those ing from countries on the Government’s amber list must quarantine at home for  days and take pre-departure and post-arrival tests.But Mr Walsh, who is the former chief executive of IAG — the parent company of British Airways — said amber restrictions should be the same as those for green list countries for fully vaccinated passengers.He told the Mail on Sunday: “People were promised the benefit of being vaccinated — a vaccine idend — and they should be given it.“I thinkyou’ve had both shots then there’s no argument you can make to say those restrictions can remain in place, and people should be free to decide for themselvesthey see any risk in travelling to a green or amber country,” the former IAG chief executive added.Most ReadI don#t think he#s laughing now: Christian Jessen to pay record damages over Arlene Foster  tweetPoots stays tight-lipped on whether he’d accept Mass inviteHurt, humiliated, trashed... and outrageously wronged: Arlene Foster’s record £k payout a warning to trolls that you can’t just post what you like and get away with itToddler Harry Magee’s tragic death stuns Aghalee communityAli G oral sex joke doc allowed to keep job at Northern Ireland hospitalTop VideosPlayEdwin Poots full speech as he is ratied new leader of the DUPPlayVideo: Donkey gets emotional when reuniting with ownerPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageCoronavirus QA: Everything you need to know as vaccination programme opens to all adultsNearly  payments issued under £k Covid grant scheme ineligibleCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths, fewer than  cases and vaccine programme extended£m to be paid out to NI businesses that managed to remain open during lockdownLatestKim Kardashian West reveals she tested positive for Covid-What the papers say – May Harry and Robin Williams’ son speak on ‘shared experience’ of public griefElton John says Lil Nas X has ‘balls of steel’Disgruntled worker who killed nine appeared to target victims,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurney PAAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMore than half of people in Northern Ireland believe parents should have the right to refuse a Covid vaccine for their children, our poll shows.The news comes after Northern Ireland’s vaccine roll-out opened to those aged  to  and a raft of Covid restrictions are lted from Monday.“This has been made possible because of the success of the vaccination programme and the majority of people acting on the public health advice,” Health Minister Robin Swann said.According to the Belfast -LucidTalk poll, % of respondents felt parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should not and % said they did not know, were not sure or had no opinion.The figures, however, y depending on the age and religious make-up of those who took part in the poll.Regarding  to  year-olds, a majorityfelt parents should not be able to turn down a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should and % didn’t know or had no opinion.Those aged  to , on the other hand, had starkly contrasting views. Some % said parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children and % said they should not. And % said they didn’t know, were unsure or had no opinion.Vaccines may be refused for a iety of reasons. For instance, earlier this year several countries temporarily halted the roll-out of the AstraZeneca jab due to concerns of rare blood clots.Due to evidence suggesting that younger people may be at greater risk of the extremely rare clots associated with the AstaZeneca vaccine, those in this age group can choose which vaccine to receive.The latest advice states that anyone under  can book a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, or they can make what the Department of Health has described as an “informed decision” and get the AstraZeneca jab at Belfast’s SSE Arena or at participating community pharmacies.More than one million people in Northern Ireland have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine to date.Looking at the religious make-up of those who took part in the poll, it is apparent that Protestants are more likely to feel parents should have a say over vaccinating their children than when compared to Catholics.Some % of Protestant respondents felt this way, while % felt they should not have the right to turn down a jab for their children and % had no opinion, were not sure or didn’t know.Of those designating as Catholic, % felt they should have the right to turn down a vaccine for their children and % did not. The remaining % said they didn’t know or were unsure.In terms of those of no religion, % were in favour of parents having this right and % did not.

A two-phase approach is proposed to progress changes in the current Assembly mandate. The first will be legislation to deliver tangible changes in around  key areas mainly in terms of premises-based gambling, including improving protection for children and young people, as well as some relaxations around hours of operation.The legislation will allow bookmakers and bingo clubs to open on Sundays and Good Friday, while it will be an offence to permit children to play gaming machines. It will also create powers to impose a statutory levy on gambling operators and establish a mandatory code of practice for those holding gambling licenses. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseLewis Keogh FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueLewis KeoghPhase two will require a much longer timescale and include a completely new regulatory framework to control online gambling, including gaming machines.Peter and Sadie are involved with the Gambling With Lives group, set up by family and friends of addicts who have taken their own lives. This is a welcome start to what looks to be a long process,” Peter said. “I’m pleased the Assembly recognises the need for this reform but frustrated that some of the major legislation around online gambling is being kicked down the road.”A  public consultation on gambling laws received nearly  responses and found “strong support” for the creation of an independent gambling regulator here.Unlike Britain, Northern Ireland does not have a gambling commission, something Peter wants to see implemented. He and Sadie believe Lewis developed a taste for gambling aged just nine when he played on arcade machines during ferry trips to France and back.Sadie added: “I’m glad to see children being protected because our son’s gambling journey began while he was at school and things spiralled from there.If these changes stop a few families from having to go through what we have, that will be something.”Ms Hargey said gambling regulations here had not kept pace with industry and technological changes.She added: “It is clear from our consultation that people are content for some of the existing legal constraints on gambling to be relaxed. But they also believe that government, the gambling industry and others need to do much more to prevent, control and combat problem gambling.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadI don#t think he#s laughing now: Christian Jessen to pay record damages over Arlene Foster  tweetPoots stays tight-lipped on whether he’d accept Mass inviteHurt, humiliated, trashed... and outrageously wronged: Arlene Foster’s record £k payout a warning to trolls that you can’t just post what you like and get away with itToddler Harry Magee’s tragic death stuns Aghalee communityAli G oral sex joke doc allowed to keep job at Northern Ireland hospitalLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland athletics meeting back on after wrangleDeirdre Heenan and Mark DayanOpinionSeven points of action which would help address waiting list mess, once and for all Jailed: woman who claimed bombs were under teachers’ carsTributes as UUP veteran Olive Whitten dies following illnessSuspect linked to gun allegedly used to fire shots at PSNI station is top member of Continuity IRA, court toldLatestNorthern Ireland athletics meeting back on after wrangleDeirdre Heenan and Mark DayanOpinionSeven points of action which would help address waiting list mess, once and for all Jailed: woman who claimed bombs were under teachers’ carsTributes as UUP veteran Olive Whitten dies following illnessSuspect linked to gun allegedly used to fire shots at PSNI station is top member of Continuity IRA, court told,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

European Athletics withdrew their permit for this Meet due to administrative concerns,” Athletics Ireland said. However, following criticism it was announced on Thursday that the permit had been restored after signicant lobbying from those within the Irish athletics community.Mr Christie, a well-known local athletics coach, accepted he had been responsible for the mix-up that led to the permit being revoked. “I will certainly hold my hands up on that, call it my inexperience, or my naivety, but I didn’t realise I had to go through the national federation,” he told the . “I did eat humble pie, I did apologise, writing them a couple of emails, begging them not to stop the permit.Mr Christie said he was ecstatic and over the moon for the athletes taking part. “I know this is the news a lot of the competing athletes wanted to hear, and I’d like to thank Athletics Ireland, and Northern Ireland Athletics and UK Athletics, for their assistance, he said. In a joint statement Athletics NI and Athletics Ireland said they had worked together with their UK counterpart to resolve the matter.Athletics Ireland and Athletics Northern Ireland have worked together behind the scenes to jointly support our athletes to facilitate the issue of a European Athletics Permit with Category D ranking points for the Belfast Irish Milers meeting at the Mary Peters Track this Saturday, the statement read.Our commitment to the athletes in both the North and South of Ireland, their health, safety and status has always been the central theme throughout the management of this matter, and we are grateful for the support of UK Athletics in working collaboratively with us in ensuring that this meet could proceed with a European Athletics Area Permit.We wish the athletes and officials a safe, enjoyable meet this weekend and look forward to some excellent performances.Irish Olympic hopefuls set to take part in the event include Mark English, Phil Healy, Paul Robinson, Cian McPhillips and Michelle Finn who will now be available to qualy for ranking points ahead of July’s event.Around  athletes are set to gather for events ranging from the m to the ,m..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadI don#t think he#s laughing now: Christian Jessen to pay record damages over Arlene Foster  tweetPoots stays tight-lipped on whether he’d accept Mass inviteHurt, humiliated, trashed... and outrageously wronged: Arlene Foster’s record £k payout a warning to trolls that you can’t just post what you like and get away with itToddler Harry Magee’s tragic death stuns Aghalee communityAli G oral sex joke doc allowed to keep job at Northern Ireland hospitalTop VideosPlayEdwin Poots full speech as he is ratied new leader of the DUPPlayVideo: Donkey gets emotional when reuniting with ownerPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest Northern IrelandDepartment of Health cannot sanction Professor Ian Young despite public inquiry criticism Allison MorrisOpinionA timely lesson for trolls who inflict hurt with their liesSuspect linked to gun allegedly used to fire shots at PSNI station is top member of Continuity IRA, court toldTributes as UUP veteran Olive Whitten dies following illnessFormer BBC Director General Tony Hall should lose peerage over Bashir’s Prince Diana scandal, says PaisleyLatestDepartment of Health cannot sanction Professor Ian Young despite public inquiry criticism Allison MorrisOpinionA timely lesson for trolls who inflict hurt with their liesTributes as UUP veteran Olive Whitten dies following illnessSuspect linked to gun allegedly used to fire shots at PSNI station is top member of Continuity IRA, court toldFormer BBC Director General Tony Hall should lose peerage over Bashir’s Prince Diana scandal, says Paisley,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Kelvin Boyes PressEyeClaire McNeillyTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailAn Ulster Unionist peer has asked the government to highlight the “shocking statistics” that prove the “damaging impact” of electric scooters.The request from Lord Rogan follows a recent report in the Belfastabout the proleration of ‘e-scooters’ on Northern Ireland’s roads, even though they are banned here.Lord Rogan pointed out that figures provided by English councils show that  people have been injured in e-scooter incidents since last summer.The UUP peer then urged Home Office minister Baroness Williams to “share statistics and provide any related background information” to devolved administrations, including Northern Ireland, in case they may feel minded to follow the government’s “misguided and dangerous policy on e-scooters”.At present e-scooters can only be used on private land in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.In England, however, government safety trials last July allow for rented vehicles on public roads or cycle lanes.Speaking in the House of Lords, Lord Rogan said: “The Belfastreported that the PSNI has stepped up enforcement actions regarding these vehicles after noticing their increased popularity.”He added: “Figures provided by local councils show that  people have been injured in e-scooter incidents since they were legalised in England last summer.”Following Lord Rogan’s request for detail, Baroness Williams pledged to share the data.Lord Rogan also revealed that he had personally had “a couple of narrow escapes from collisions with e-scooters whilst walking through London”.“Many more accidents are sadly inevitable as the trials across England continue,” he said.“The Belfastreport helpfully highlighted the concerns held by the PSNI despite e-scooters being illegal in public places in Northern Ireland.“I look forward to Baroness Williams sharing the damaging information the UK Government possesses on their usage in England.”Lord Rogan added: “I hope that this will be sufficient to remove any intentions Stormont Ministers may have to launch similar trials in Northern Ireland.”The PSNI recently warned electric scooter users that they face hefty fines and vehicle seizurethey operate them on public roads, adding that enforcement action had been “stepped up”.Although environmentally friendly, e-scooters — which can be modied to reach speeds of over  miles per hour — have not been approved for public road usage.They have, however, been used in hundreds of robberies, assaults, thefts and other crimes in ious UK cities over recent months, with criminals preferring them to bicycles or mopeds because they are fast, silent — and unregistered.Inspector Rosie Leech, from the PSNI’s Road Policing Unit, said anyone misusing an e-scooter “should expect to receive a formal warning as a minimum course of action”.“There is also the real possibility of riders being issued with fixed penalty notices.“Officers also have powers to seize a motor vehicle.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the

He said the remarks had caused “huge offence”.Mr Poots later denied his remarks were sectarian, saying they could not be because “most Sinn Fein leaders don’t attend the Catholic Church on a regular basis”..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadI don#t think he#s laughing now: Christian Jessen to pay record damages over Arlene Foster  tweetPoots stays tight-lipped on whether he’d accept Mass inviteHurt, humiliated, trashed... and outrageously wronged: Arlene Foster’s record £k payout a warning to trolls that you can’t just post what you like and get away with itToddler Harry Magee’s tragic death stuns Aghalee communityAli G oral sex joke doc allowed to keep job at Northern Ireland hospitalTop VideosPlayEdwin Poots full speech as he is ratied new leader of the DUPPlayVideo: Donkey gets emotional when reuniting with ownerPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest Northern IrelandOusting of my father as DUP leader ‘killed him’ – Ian PaisleyNew DUP leader Edwin Poots hits out at senior Irish Government figuresDemocratic Unionist Party raty Edwin Poots as new leaderTV doctor’s  tweet could end up costing him over £kEdwin Poots officially ratied as new leader of Democratic Unionist PartyLatestlfie McCalmont: Northern Ireland youngsters must justy Ian Baraclough’s faithKim Kardashian West reveals she tested positive for Covid-What the papers say – May Harry and Robin Williams’ son speak on ‘shared experience’ of public griefElton John says Lil Nas X has ‘balls of steel’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The coup, which cleaned out bookies in Ireland and England, was simple but brilliantly conceived and executed.Curley had noted that there was only one public telephone at the racetrack at Bellewstown in the heart of rural Ireland. There was also a private line, but mysteriously it was out of action that day, presumed to have been cut. In tandem with the Belfast bookie Sean Graham, Curley had organised a small army of associates to bet anything from £ to £ in bookie shops around Ireland and England on his “slow but steady” horse Yellow Sam, running in the .pm Mount Hanover Amateur Handicap hurdle that Wednesday. But crucially he had to prevent news of the gamble getting to the course in order to keep the odds at  .Five minutes before the bets were laid, Benny O’Hanlon, an associate of Curley’s, wedged himself into the only working telephone box at the course and refused to budge, preventing news of the money piling on the horse being relayed to the on-course bookies. So Yellow Sam, a rank outsider with jockey Michael Furlong on board, passed the winning post well ahead of the rest of the field. Curley made an estimated £, on that single race.“We paid out like men,” said the Dublin bookie Terry Rodgers, ruefully. “But what annoyed me later on was the revelation that Curley and Graham had been in cahoots, which is a bit rich for a guy who is always going on about bookies rigging the market. It’s fortunate for Barney that he trained as a theologian, because he can justy everything he does to his Jesuitical conscience.”Curley then bought Middleton Park, a stately home on nearly  acres on the shores of Lough Ennell, in Co Westmeath. It was originally the ancestral home of Sir Cecil Boyd-Rochford, horse trainer to British royalty. At the foot of the great staircase he told me in  that his main reasons for disposing of the mansion was because the Irish telephone system was so unreliable, he didn’t know who might be listening in on the line as he planned his secretive gambling exploits.But instead of selling the estate he raffled it. With an elaborate brochure, a video featuring racing and GAA commentator, Michael O’Hehir and appearances on RTE’s Late Late Show and other media he grossed an estimated £.m selling , tickets at £ each. But when gardai raided the house the week before the draw, they came away with just one ticket, leaving Curley with a warning that what he was doing was illegal.With the draw due to take place at pm on Thursday, February , , in a nearby hotel, Curley surmised that the gardai might seize the tickets before the winner could be picked. In a pre-emptive strike at am that morning, as several gardai arrived following a front page story in the Evening Herald, O’Hehir hastily drew the winning ticket bearing the name of Tony Ray.Curley and O’Hehir were arrested and appeared before Judge William Tormey at Ballynacargy District Court, charged with running an illegal lottery. O’Hehir was cleared as his was a “professional” assignment. The judge, a racing man himself, convicted Curley of a “blatant and illegal” breach of the Lotteries Act and dramatically sentenced him to three months in prison.On appeal just days later, he was given the Probation Acthe agreed to donate £, to St Vincent de Paul. Curley wrote a cheque for £, and walked out a free man with an estimated £m in his back pocket, for a house that was sold some years later for £,.Bernard Joseph Curley, who died last Sunday of cancer at his home in Newmarket, England at the age of , was born in Irvinestown, Co Fermanagh. His parents were Catholic, but his father, a shopkeeper, was an “enthusiastic” gambler and drinker who often left the family in dire financial straits.Curley was educated at the Jesuit seminary of Mungret College, Limerick but left after falling ill with TB shortly before he was due to be ordained.“People were dying all around me like flies,” he said later. “There was not much to be scared about after that.”In his autobiography Giving a Little Back, he said he never held down a regular job. He ran a pub, went bust as a bookie, and then became a showband manager with Frankie McBride and the Polka Dots, getting them into the British charts in  with the slushy ballad, Five Little Fingers.At a gig in Killarney, he was introduced to Maureen Curley from St Helen’s in Lancashire, England and when they married, he estimated that given there were so few Curleys in the world their union was a  million to one shot.But it wasn’t all big paydays. He recalled nursing losses of £, after betting against Vincent O’Brien’s Golden Fleece, favourite for the  Epsom Derby. “My judgment just misfired completely,” he wrote. “A lesser man might have been persuaded to pack it in immediately, but I never panicked and I didn’t allow it to get to me. I took Maureen and the kidsto Calornia and effectively retired for three months.”After the Middleton Park raffle, he moved to Newmarket and took out a trainer’s licence. In his memoirs he said that he needed to make £, a year from gambling, just to keep the operation afloat — and there hadn’t been a year that he didn’t meet that target.In May  after two of his long-priced horses won at substantial odds a third, trained by his former assistant, was backed from   to   and landed a gamble that was said to have earned him in the region of €.m, although some online bookies refused to pay. He had another touch, making an estimated €.m in .One of his protégé’s, the jockey Frankie Dettori, conceded that Curley “got under people’s skin” but added that he was “a one-man band” who owned, trained, raced and gambled on his own horses.In later years most of his energies went into the charity, Direct Aid for Africain Zambia. Supported by Dettori, JP McManus and Sheikh Mohammad of Dubai he established it with a friend from his seminary days Fr James O’Kane, following the death of his -year-old son Charlie in a car accident in .He travelled to Africa regularly and said he got great solace and comfort from the work it did there, after his roller-coaster le as gambler, showman and thorn in the side of authority..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadI don#t think he#s laughing now: Christian Jessen to pay record damages over Arlene Foster  tweetPoots stays tight-lipped on whether he’d accept Mass inviteHurt, humiliated, trashed... and outrageously wronged: Arlene Foster’s record £k payout a warning to trolls that you can’t just post what you like and get away with itToddler Harry Magee’s tragic death stuns Aghalee communityAli G oral sex joke doc allowed to keep job at Northern Ireland hospitalTop VideosPlayEdwin Poots full speech as he is ratied new leader of the DUPPlayVideo: Donkey gets emotional when reuniting with ownerPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest Northern IrelandDepartment of Health cannot sanction Professor Ian Young despite public inquiry criticism Ousting of my father as DUP leader ‘killed him’ – Ian PaisleyNew DUP leader Edwin Poots hits out at senior Irish Government figuresDemocratic Unionist Party raty Edwin Poots as new leaderTV doctor’s  tweet could end up costing him over £kLatestDepartment of Health cannot sanction Professor Ian Young despite public inquiry criticism lfie McCalmont: Northern Ireland youngsters must justy Ian Baraclough’s faithKim Kardashian West reveals she tested positive for Covid-What the papers say – May Harry and Robin Williams’ son speak on ‘shared experience’ of public grief,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Niall CarsonChristian Jessen at an earlier court appearance FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueHearing: First Minister Arlene Foster. Credit: Niall CarsonAlan Erwin and Allison MorrisMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailCelebrity doctor Christian Jessen’s bill for posting a  tweet about outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster may be in excess of £,. Mr Justice McAlinden awarded £, in damages — a record figure for defamation on Twitter — to Mrs Foster for the TV star’s “grossly defamatory” and unfounded rumours. However, an indemnity costs order made against the doctor will see him pick up the bill for Mrs Foster’s legal team, as well as his own. According to one legal expert, those legal costs are likely to be a “substantial six-figure sum”, with the onus on Jessen to arguehe believes that the costs are unreasonable. The tweet was  words in , meaning the potential £, final bill works out at more than £, for every word. Mr Justice McAlinden called the online attack on Mrs Foster “an outrageous libel concerning an inidual of considerable standing, attacking her integrity at a most fundamental level... it involves the trashing, in a very public fashion, of the relationship that Mrs Foster holds dearest in her le. “It affected core aspects of the plaintf’s le, namely, her relationship with her husband and her deep Christian faith.” Mrs Foster sued the Harley Street medic, best known for presenting Channel  shows Embarrassing Bodies and Supersize v Superskinny, over the tweet published to his , followers on December , , and only taken down two weeks later. It involved baseless claims that the then leader of the DUP was in an adulterous relationship with one of her close protection officers. In evidence, she described how the untrue rumours humiliated her at a time when she was involved in talks to restore power-sharing. Mrs Foster told the court how the message, posted two days before Christmas, “trashed” her -year marriage, adding: “It was almost asthis cut to the very core of my le.” Even though she had already secured a default judgment, a ruling on the scale of damages was put on hold after Jessen mounted an eleventh-hour bid to enter a late defence. He claimed he never received court papers sent to his London apartment and was unaware the case had reached hearing. He also insisted he shut out all news last year and moved back in with his mother and father because of the pandemic and his depression. But the judge rejected this account, saying Jessen chose to ignore proceedings “until shocked into action by the scale of the press coverage of Mrs Foster’s evidence”. With the libel retweeted  times and liked by at least , users, Mr Justice McAlinden accepted submissions that others would have formed the view that “ Christian Jessen is tweeting this, then it must be true”. Describing his tweet as “an outrageously bad libel”, he added: “I readily accept the plaintf’s evidence that this… cut her to the core, causing very considerable upset, distress, humiliation, embarrassment and hurt.” Dr Jessen’s “woefully inadequate and deliberately misleading” response to the case, when one was finally made, and the failure to publish any form of apology or retraction were further aggravating features. Announcing the damages, the judge referred to ‘the green book’, used to assess compensation. Mrs Foster’s solicitor, Paul Tweed, described the outcome as a complete vindication for the politician and a potential “watershed” for all women attacked on social media. On Thursday night appearing on the BBC’s Newscast podcast Mrs Foster said she was planning to dedicate her time to combatting online abuse. She said anonymity needed to be challenged, “So that’s the route I want to try and continue with.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadI don#t think he#s laughing now: Christian Jessen to pay record damages over Arlene Foster  tweetPoots stays tight-lipped on whether he’d accept Mass inviteHurt, humiliated, trashed... and outrageously wronged: Arlene Foster’s record £k payout a warning to trolls that you can’t just post what you like and get away with itToddler Harry Magee’s tragic death stuns Aghalee communityAli G oral sex joke doc allowed to keep job at Northern Ireland hospitalLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland athletics meeting back on after wrangleDeirdre Heenan and Mark DayanOpinionSeven points of action which would help address waiting list mess, once and for all Jailed: woman who claimed bombs were under teachers’ carsTributes as UUP veteran Olive Whitten dies following illnessSuspect linked to gun allegedly used to fire shots at PSNI station is top member of Continuity IRA, court toldLatestDeirdre Heenan and Mark DayanOpinionSeven points of action which would help address waiting list mess, once and for all Jailed: woman who claimed bombs were under teachers’ carsTributes as UUP veteran Olive Whitten dies following illnessSuspect linked to gun allegedly used to fire shots at PSNI station is top member of Continuity IRA, court toldLisa SmythOpinionWe’re paying the price for failure of Stormont to deliver necessary change ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mrs Foster gave a peace sign as she left.Paul Bell, a member of the Fermanagh and South Tyrone DUP association for  years, dramatically announced he has quit the party.Talking to the media outside the hotel, he said the party will “shed tens of thousands of votes” because of the way Mrs Foster#s departure was handled.Mr Poots said it was natural people would have strong feelings after a leadership contest.Everybody that goes through an electoral contest will have some passion, passion is good in politics, I like to see people having passion, sometimes even when they are people who are contesting with me, he said.Referring to Mr Bell, the Lagan Valley MLA said sometimes people don#t like the outcome and they do things in the heat of the moment.The -year-old said he had been blamed for things he hadn#t done over the past few weeks, but it would have been inappropriate to defend himself.Mr Poots said he had been confirmed twice as DUP leader and was looking forward to my colleagues joining with me to defend this union that we cherish.The new DUP leader had strong words for the Irish Government, saying that while he respected Taoiseach Micheal Martin, he held Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney responsible for the Northern Ireland Protocol due to their actions during the Brexit negotiation process.He said the protocol was a shame on the Irish Government.Relationships are really, really bad with the Irish Government as a consequence, Mr Poots said.North Antrim MP Ian Paisley said thatanyone understood the pain caused by a political leadership change it was him.He said his late father had been left heartbroken after being forced out as DUP leader, and that it contributed to his poor health.If anyone in this party can talk about dficulty it#s me, you saw what happened to my dad, it killed my father, I know it hurts, Mr Paisley said.We have to keep working as a party and we will make it work for our country because we are the only party that can save the union, retain the union and build the union.He acknowledged Mrs Foster#s departure had been extremely dficult and said there needed to be a rebuilding of relationships.It was a very straightforward and honest meeting, some people poured out their souls, some people were emotional and they were entitled to be that. This party is always described as a bit of a family party and sometimes in your family you have a bit of a ding dong and there was probably a bit of a ding dong, but we#ll pull together, Mr Paisley said.East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson also denied their were isions within the party.People had an opportunity to say, they said it very forthrightly and it was all very amicable at the end of the day and a decision was made, he said.I can#t speak for every inidual. Some people will be unhappy with some changes that happen. All I can say is there was agreement at the end of the meeting as to who we should choose.Nobody was coerced into voting one way or another. They are all big boys and girls who can make up their own minds and gave their own say.Appearing on the BBC’s Newscast podcast, Mrs Foster commented on her ousting as party leader.“It’s not particularly pleasant,” the outgoing First Minister said.“I think that I said a couple of days after what had happened that politics is brutal, but even by DUP standards it was pretty brutal, in terms of what happened.“I had absolutely no idea and was telephoned by a close colleague that this was happening on Monday evening and then by Tuesday morning, it was all in the papers.”Paula Bradley was also confirmed as the DUP’s next deputy leader, replacing Nigel Dodds, after her victory over party veteran Gregory Campbell in the leadership election..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadI don#t think he#s laughing now: Christian Jessen to pay record damages over Arlene Foster  tweetPoots stays tight-lipped on whether he’d accept Mass inviteHurt, humiliated, trashed... and outrageously wronged: Arlene Foster’s record £k payout a warning to trolls that you can’t just post what you like and get away with itToddler Harry Magee’s tragic death stuns Aghalee communityAli G oral sex joke doc allowed to keep job at Northern Ireland hospitalTop VideosPlayEdwin Poots full speech as he is ratied new leader of the DUPPlayVideo: Donkey gets emotional when reuniting with ownerPlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest PoliticsNearly  payments issued under £k Covid grant scheme ineligibleSDLP tipped to co-opt Black Lives Matter activist to councilOusting of Foster not in our name, says Fermanagh DUPSarah CreightonOpinionUnionism needs to be smart on who it talks to in unication debate and can’t bury its head in the sandRules on referendum campaigns ‘must be updated’ ahead of any border pollLatestlfie McCalmont: Northern Ireland youngsters must justy Ian Baraclough’s faithKim Kardashian West reveals she tested positive for Covid-What the papers say – May Harry and Robin Williams’ son speak on ‘shared experience’ of public griefElton John says Lil Nas X has ‘balls of steel’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

End to end swashbuckling football that turns the stomach inside out. Slaughtneils shoot-out with Kilcar in Omagh a few seasons back. Derrys win over Dublin in the  All-Ireland semi-final. Armagh and Kerrys blockbuster in the  All-Ireland Final are some that instantly jump onto this page. But championship is about so much more. It is about character and pulling a result from somewhere, like a rabbit from a hat. I think about Dungivens Ulster winning team of . Their performance against Errigal Ciaran that day in Clones was brilliant. It was a convincing win, but they nearly didnt get out of the first round of the championship in Derry that year. googletag.cmd.push In two nerve-tangling encounters at Drumsurn, they escaped from Glenullins clutches on the seat of their pants. Ruairi Boylans - nearly toppled them in the drawn game, before coming through by a point in a replay, their lowest winning margin of the season, second only to a two-point Ulster semi-final over St Pauls of Belfast. There are many others down the years, but when I think about the term championship team those two games in Drumsurn rush to the forefront of my mind. A team finding a way to win, Glenullin dying with their boots on. Chatting to Mark Lynch for a piece on Derrys encounters with Longford got me thinking. Are Derry really a qualier team  googletag.cmd.push More often than not, it was a sorry story from the house of pain. Before the qualiers began in , Derry were on the wrong end of two massive refereeing decisions. Henry Downeys perfectly time shoulder charge on Paddy McKeever yielded a free in as their Ulster semi-final with Armagh sat in the mixer, with the Orchard County going on to win the first of two Ulster titles. Then,  months later, they got another soft free – with BBC commentator and former Armagh legend Jimmy Smyth admitting as much on commentary – to go ahead before Anthony missed a chance to level the game from a free well outside the .     Sting through the championship records, I start to wonder how the mental scars couldve affected the county as a whole. Derrys runs to the All-Ireland Qualiers yielded the  tilt at Sam, only for running out of diesel coming down the final furlong of the infamous semi-final and Galways Matthew Clancy delivering a hammer blow. As the years went past, the challenge dwindled. The  season ended in a comprehensive enough defeat to Kerry in the semi-final. There was the high-octane battle against the Dubs in the  Quarter-Final and the defeat to Tipperary in the last- clash in Breffni in . Outside of that, Derrys championship record of the last  years is a reality check. Of the  championship games, there were  wins,  defeats and a sole draw, against Tyrone in , Mickey Hartes first game in charge. Derry have played  qualier games, winning . Of the  defeats, three were after extra time and the only extra time win was over Cavan in  at Celtic Park. Of the  victories, only the  win over Mayo and a one-point win over Armagh the same year jump out as scalps. The win over Monaghan in Clones two years later was of note. The rest, on paper, were games Derry were favourites in, including three wins from four against Cavan – the only county Derry havent faced over the last two decades in the Ulster championship. Then you have the Longford story with one win in four games. Add in two wins from four against Laois, another team Derry would fancy beating. In Ulster, Derry have won just  times in  games, with that one draw thrown in. On the face of it, the result looks grim, but scratch the surface and  of those games were against either Donegal or Tyrone. Of that,  were in the first round. The  win, under the baking sun in Ballybofey, was Derrys only win over Donegal in eight attempts. Of the eight clashes with Tyrone, the famous  win in Omagh, when the Red Hands were All-Ireland champions, is the only victory. In fairness, thats a tough series of draws. Five of the defeats to Donegal came in an era when they were jostling in the pecking order behind Dublin. The same can be said for Tyrone. But Glenullin wouldve been fair from Ulster club contenders in , yet couldve dumped Dungiven out on their ear. A team with the McKeevers, Brolly, McGilligan, goalkeeper Eoin McCloskey and rising star Paul Murphy. As Derry go into this years Ulster championship, they search for a first win in the competition since  and there is a decent chance it will be Donegal again. From looking back at the championship records, it changes the attitude on where Derry currently sit. Yes, there is a lot of talent coming along, but there is nothing that breeds growth like winning games. And especially when against the odds. I think back to Castlebar in . After being relegated from Division  and shipping a hammering by Tyrone in Ulster, Derry were seconds away from turning Mayo over. Conor Loftus bagged a goal to change the game and Derry went out with a whimper after extra-time. Two years later, in the Ulster championship opener in Omagh, Derry had Tyrone momentarily on the ropes. But after Shane McGuigans goal, they needed to attack the jugular even more. Darren McCurry had the ball in the net a matter of seconds later, as Tyrone outscored Derry - to -. Then there was last years game with Armagh. If Derry had got anything out of the first ten minutes, when they were all at sea, theyd have had a brilliant chance of victory. Thats three games and three massive uses of the word , but thats where Derrys future lies. Speaking before the start of this season, manager Rory Gallagher highlighted how Derry, in recent years, failed to win games that mattered. He mentioned championship and key relegation or promotion games. The manner of both league wins so far point to a team that can have a real cut at the Ulster championship on the other side of battling for promotion. Derry need to replicate Dungiven from that night in Drumsurn, in the  championship. By hook or by crook, find a way of turning performances into results.

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He waves a cursory greeting and continues on his way. In the time it takes me to gather everything I need together, he passes me again, his step count no doubt rising with every lap of the town. Zoom. Walk. Laptop. Bake. Netflix. Repetition has become endemic over the last year, but its something Moneymore cant be accused of. There is a unique feel to the fronts of the buildings that greet me as I walk around the town. Even the post office, now boarded up, remains unbranded. googletag.cmd.push Moneymores terrain gives the town a layered effect. The pillared entrance of The Manor House provides the backdrop to the towns mini roundabout, welcoming motorists coming down the hill from Smith Street. Rusty scaffolding frames a construction site on my left as I make my way down. A woman waters potted plants in her compact front garden. The distinctive smell of curry is emanating from the two Chinese restaurants at the bottom of the hill. Shutters are down on Antonios pizza, yet to open for the day. More scaffolding sits alongside buildings in mid-construction off High Street, but no work appears to be going on today. googletag.cmd.push Along Lawford Street there are ersion signs in place as Council staff busy themselves in resurfacing the Turnaface Road. The grating sound of the road roller echoes off the houses that line the street leading back to the town centre. You could describe Moneymore as ornate. Older, unique buildings, set at dferent levels, create a layered backdrop, crowned by the spire of St John and St Treas church on the top of the hill.  The hum of a small aircraft passing overhead and the unmistakable smell of freshly-cut grass adds to the sense of a town taking new-found pleasure in the mundane.     A pregnant sky threatens rain. Taken a dip I nip into The Mane Barber Shop, where a neon sign declares the shop open for business. Owner Pauline McGarvey is at her lunch. She says reopening has not been the silver bullet the industry was hoping for. “This week has been terrible. For the first seven days [after reopening] it was great, but its taken a dip again,” she tells me. “The older folk that keep you going – your pensioners and farmers and that during the day – they havent been about the same. A vintage tractor model welcomes visitors to the town from the Tyrone side. “It was a gamble coming into a small town. You do have a bit of passing trade but youre hoping people are going to come in from the likes of Coagh, Lissan and Loup. “I said I would give it six months and see how it turns. Its fine, but its not busy. You have that fear of whether its going to come back.” Pauline has been in Moneymore three years, and until the pandemic ruthlessly attacked all businesses, things had been going well.  has seen a seismic change across all industries, driving many hair and beauty professionals off the high street altogether. “Lots of people are working from home and I have to admit, Im tempted,” she says. “Youre still going to be hit with rates, and you havent stopped paying your water bill, your electricity, your rent. “Yes, we got a bit of help, butyouve no customers in, then that money is all going to go and you still have to find wages too. “Ive seen a lot of hair and beauty people who havent gone back from the first lockdown.” Humanity adapts though, and over the last year, Pauline has embraced the situation in which the world found itself. She got married in February, and has enjoyed the extra time with her family. Keeping an eye on litter in the area. “It was the first time in my le I could actually say I was a mummy. I loved spending time with the weans,” she says. “It felt like wed a whole  years wrapped into one year. It is nice getting back though, you need the routine. Its bittersweet in a way.” Cookstown native Pauline says lockdown has really hit young people in the area hard. Her daughter, Danielle, is in Year , her entire GCSE years undertaken amid a worldwide health crisis. “Even she says she could do with another year at school,” she says. “Theyve missed a full year of preparation for the next step. Theyve been living alone in their bedroom. No formal, nothing. They werent even in school to plan it.” Its a quiet day in the barber shop, on what would normally be a busy Friday afternoon, with people popping in ahead of their weekend plans. There would have been excited chatter, the buzz of anticipation. Last minute changes of plan. Maybe even a wee drink. A look at her schedule confirms a gap of a few hours until Paulines next appointment. Without that steady flow of customers, the day can be long, lonely even. Welcome to Moneymore. Company is a two way street, and the dynamic of conversation, service and industry has been greatly missed by both barber and customer. “Even the most bald man that I have is in here every week,” says Pauline. “Two seconds would do it, but you would stretch it out to ten or  minutes, just because he likes coming in for the company. “Sometimes its just nice to get sitting down and get it done for you. Even though I have good faithful customers, I was nervous and jittery the first day back. “The amount of people who are saying its great to see you back, it gives you that wee glow. It would be nice to see a boom in Moneymore again. “I dont think anybody is going to feel anything dferent. Were all just going with the flow and trying not to stress and worry. “I think youre just going to have to wipe this year out the same as last year.”  The indicators that marked the early, panic-stricken days of the pandemic – the empty streets, closed schools, empty supermarket shelves – have long faded into memory. Only the window dressing remains. Sanitisers at shop doors. Face masks in shops. The odd discarded rubber glove on the street. All three car dealerships on the Magherafelt Road are dotted with customers as I drive past on the way home. The petrol station forecourt is hiving with people. By next Monday, theof indoor hospitality will mark another signicant step on the road to recovery. On the way out of the town, I spot a familiar cowboy hat bobbing up and down at the road side. A man enjoying his rediscovered freedom on the fringes of the Sperrins.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Just over a year before his tragic and untimely death, Karl dragged Ballinascreen to the  title, overturning their U final defeat at the hands of Banagher two years earlier. The restructuring of the age grades, away from U, means the rescheduled  meeting of Lavey and Dungiven will be the last time a trophy will be presented in Karls honour. Karl proudly wearing his Ballinascreen colours. googletag.cmd.push Fittingly, Fridays showdown will be played at Ballinascreen, but his legacy wont end there. A banner placed prominently along the new walking track at Dean McGlinchey Park will keep his memory burning brightly. Either side of Karls photo are images of his Ballinascreen jerseys, football and hurling. His hurl and boots, as well as his distinctive helmet are also pictured. The generations that follow, those too young to remember his performances in the maroon and white, will be forever reminded of Karl. He epitomised sport. His jovial character made a team more than about training and games. On the flip-side, youd want him in your corner when the chips were down. googletag.cmd.push Step back in time. With seven minutes of the  U final remaining, Gavin ONeills penalty levelled matters and it was time for someone to stand up and be counted. Ballinascreen had that somebody. His name was Karl McAuley. After powering upfield, he laid the ball off to Carlus McWilliams and one pass later Dean Flanagan slotted the ball beyond goalkeeper Daryl McDermott for the game-defining goal. Ballinascreen captain on the day was Karls best friend Alastair Clerkin. They grew up a mile apart, were in the same class at the nearby Straw Primary School and soldiered together on the same football teams.     Ironically Alastairs son was born on the anniversary of Karls death. Alastair would place flowers on Karls grave and is still a close friend of the family. Shortly after Karls death, Alastairs mother Bernie left a statue at the grave of two warriors battling for a high ball, which inspired the design of the model handed out to the dozen who followed in Karls footsteps as Man of the Match. It helped Karls spirit stand the test of time. The Mid-Ulster Observers report described his  final midfield performance as a Tour de Force.  The Mid Ulster Observer match report from the  U Final The year after Karls death, Derry minors first trial was at Ballinascreen where had been tipped to play a starring role and nail down a place on the . There was an impeccable minute silence in the clubs hall before an army of nervous and excited trialists embarked on a morning of football. But for that minute, there wasnt a sound. And there will be a lump in every Ballinascreen throat on Friday night when the final U Man of the Match follows in Karls footsteps. He played around the middle for Ballinascreen teams, somewhere he could shape a game from. Those who knew him best, coached him and played alongside him tipped him for a long career. “Karl was brilliant that day,” Clerkin recalls of his box to box U final performance. “He was just everywhere and making things happen...he covered every blade of grass. “He wouldve been very consistent, but in that game, he was on a dferent level by his own standards. It was one of those games when he stood up and dragged the team with him.” It was fitting that Karls spadework made the dference, in the pressure cooker of the closing stages. Clerkin paid him the highest compliment, calling him a big game player. A championship man. Martin Boyle, who coached that U team with Mickey ONeill and Jerome Bradley, said how Karl, in his finest hour, simply dragged his side to victory by refusing to accept a defeat that was staring them in the face. Outside of the white heat of battle, Karl didnt take himself too serious. At training, many wouldve been on the receiving end of his jokes. Then, asflicking a switch, hed put his game face on and deliver by the bucketful, when it mattered. “He was there primarily for the craic and to enjoy himself and he was quite good at football as it happened,” Clerkin adds. “Hed still be playing with all the lads he grew up with...you miss the craic you wouldve had with him.” The banner to be erected at Dean McGlinchey Park.

The Kilrea team, led by James Kielt, who went through their entire club underage careers unbeaten overcame Ballinascreen in the  Feacuteile final. “He was our best player that day at corner back and he was a year young,” Boyle remembers. Boyle is now the Derry minor manager, a team that includes Matthew Downey and Dan Higgins, the last two winners of the U final Man of the Match. “I told them just how special an award it is as Karl was such a special person and sportsman.” Like Clerkin, Boyle echoed Karls off the pitch qualities. “Karl made a lasting impression on everyone fortunate enough to come into contact with him,” Boyle said. “In a team environment he was a dream, brilliant for morale and craic among lads.” At school, he played on St Colms U Derry championship winning team of , their first in many years. When asked for a memory of Karl McAuley, their coach Ciaran Meenagh looked back on their Ulster clash with St Pauls Bessbrook. St Colms were leading by two points, as the game ticked into the last  minutes in a foggy winter afternoon. After an off the ball incident, the game  boiled over. Meenagh points to it as a scary moment for a typical  year-old. But not Karl, who won the hop ball, kicked two late points and alongside Anton Kelly, the pair stemmed the tide. “It was just indicative of his character and his backbone,” Meenagh states. “He was tough and had a savage temperament...he would have gone far...I’m sure of that. “He was just a super lad altogether, what a character. He had a brilliant heart on the field of play.” The McAuley family will feel Karls loss more than anyone. Theyll miss him every day. But, tucked amongst those emotions, they can take strength from how he rubbed off on others. Those who competed with and against him on the playing fields of Derry and beyond held him in the highest regard. Its fitting the last piece of the history from the Derry U football championship will be the presentation of Karls award, the final Tour de Force. Thats his legacy. He will never be forgotten.

After crossing the bridge, I head up the hill and pull the car in opposite the Vivo and the magnicently named Rio Grande bar. Parks Rio Grande, the Faughan River, flows through the centre of the village, which this afternoon sits under an angry-looking sky. A woman walks her dog down Learmount Road, her face set against the stf breeze that is swishing through the trees surrounding the village. The scene on Learmount Road leading up the hill. Rain starts to fall as a mother guides her toddler out the doors of the Vivo, one hand clutching hers and the other gripping the bottle of juice he has just been bought. googletag.cmd.push A large plastic ice cream cone sits hopefully outside the shop. Up the hill comes a learner driver seemingly on a lesson. She stops outside Learmount Resource Centre and disappears into the building, before emerging with her child in tow to resume her lesson. A delivery driver pulls into the yard of Devine Kitchens. He s to his cab and pulls out a hammer. Things must be getting serious. As I cross the bridge, I spot the wheel from an old watermill by the river side, almost reclaimed by its surroundings. A remnant of an  flax mill known as Quigleys Mill. googletag.cmd.push Perhaps the most clear view of the mill is from the top of the hill outside Park Hardware and DIY. Greg McElhinney and Matthew Devine. Inside, owner Greg McElhinney says the last year has been busy. “With construction and everything  closing down last April, we were very busy, which was good for us because people from the local area were able to do home projects,” he tells me. “The weather was good as well, so youd a lot of painting and decorating – fences and gardens and stuff like that – going on. “People were happy there was a local business still operating, because a lot of the bigger hardware stores had closed.     “It got to the stage when it was hard to source materials because suppliers were closed until June time, but people were happy enough to occupy their time. They had nothing  to do.” The remains of Quigleys Mill, Park. Parks postal area recorded an increase in Covid cases last week, and despite the attachment to Derry city skewing the numbers, Greg admits there is still a degree of worry locally. “The majority of the population feel we still have to be serious about this. Its drilled into everybody at this stage, like putting your seatbelt on in the car,” he says. “The worry now is were straddling the Donegal border to a certain extent and case numbers are very high either side of it. “There is more positivity now than there was maybe six weeks ago though. Society is opening up again, and the vaccinations are a positive thing.” Covid has taken its toll on rural le too, and compliance with regulations has come at a social cost for village communities. “Where were based is very much a rural area, with a lot of the farming community and tradesmen and stuff,” says Greg. “You get some people who, by chance, meet up outside the shop here and have an opportunity to have a chat that maybe havent seen each other in a few months. “Those guys would have been at markets or farm meets every week, or pubs, but now you see them sitting out there for half an hour chatting to each other. “The social aspect, face to face, is the biggest thing. “The local community group have done a lot of work with the walkways there over the past number of years, which is very good.” Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty from Learmount Community Development Group. The local community group to which Greg refers is Learmount Community Development Group, which is nestled down a lane next to the entrance to Learmount Forest. Over the last year, Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty have noticed a big increase in people using Parks hidden gem. “We would have come down here some mornings and that car park would be full,” says Caroline. “Our secret Learmount Forest isnt a secret any more, and thats great, because everybody wants out, and weve had drop-ins coming from that.” “The forest has been fantastic for people being able to get out and safely meet their neighbours,” adds Catriona. “Theyll maybe call in at quiet times to have a socially distanced cup of tea. That social aspect has been missed, they are missing company and casual conversation.” Caroline feels the experience of the last year has sharpened focus on the issue of loneliness that had been hiding in plain sight. “We had a man who lives alone and had been sick for two or three days,” she says. “He hadnt been out and had no food in the house, so thankfully we were able to help with that. “You just know people are lonely and looking to get out again, but at the same time are a bit anxious about it. “Theyre happy to take the summer out of it and see what happens. There is certainly a lot of loneliness, isolation and depression though. “You could obviously be in the middle of a housing site and still be lonely, but when you see some of the people on their own, up a lane, they see nobody. They barely even see the postman now.” Working with both young and old people, the group have seen the effect the pandemic and its associated lockdowns have had on both generations.  “A lot of our work is with older people, and whilst theyre saying theyre fed up, some of them are getting a wee bit set in their ways,” says Caroline. “You just know by talking to them. We had a woman who always came in every week, even when it was bad, and she hasnt been in about two months. “Its highlighted how much we miss the social side of things, not being able to get out and meet friends. Even for the youth. “People always think all they need is their phone, because thats all theyre sitting on, but you can see now how the youth are crying out as much for social contact as any other generation.” There is hope though, that with the vaccines roll out and the upcoming warmer weather, that the group will be able to run some of their usual summer events. “We are looking at putting together a summer programme, but wed be a bit nervous ourselves about bringing a group of people into the room,” says Caroline.  “It would be perfectthere was good weather, because it will be planned outdoors. If the weather is bad, well take it over to Park hall, because its a bit bigger than here. “We have funding for dancing and music, which I think people would love to hear. Wed love to have tables out there on a nice evening, with a bit of a barbecue and a bit of music. “Youd like to think by September, we should be able to get going.” On the way back through the village, the shutters are half up on the Rio Grande as preparations continue inside. By the time you read this it will have reopened its doors. Hospitality has ed throughout the county, another step on the road to recovery. The farmers outside Greg McElhinneys store now have somewhere  to shoot the breeze. For the next few weeks at least, Covid fears will be drowned out by clink of glasses, the audible relief of the repressed socialite and the laughter of friends reunited. Dancing, however, is still prohibited under the regulations.

After crossing the bridge, I head up the hill and pull the car in opposite the Vivo and the magnicently named Rio Grande bar. Parks Rio Grande, the Faughan River, flows through the centre of the village, which this afternoon sits under an angry-looking sky. A woman walks her dog down Learmount Road, her face set against the stf breeze that is swishing through the trees surrounding the village. The scene on Learmount Road leading up the hill. Rain starts to fall as a mother guides her toddler out the doors of the Vivo, one hand clutching hers and the other gripping the bottle of juice he has just been bought. googletag.cmd.push A large plastic ice cream cone sits hopefully outside the shop. Up the hill comes a learner driver seemingly on a lesson. She stops outside Learmount Resource Centre and disappears into the building, before emerging with her child in tow to resume her lesson. A delivery driver pulls into the yard of Devine Kitchens. He s to his cab and pulls out a hammer. Things must be getting serious. As I cross the bridge, I spot the wheel from an old watermill by the river side, almost reclaimed by its surroundings. A remnant of an  flax mill known as Quigleys Mill. googletag.cmd.push Perhaps the most clear view of the mill is from the top of the hill outside Park Hardware and DIY. Greg McElhinney and Matthew Devine. Inside, owner Greg McElhinney says the last year has been busy. “With construction and everything  closing down last April, we were very busy, which was good for us because people from the local area were able to do home projects,” he tells me. “The weather was good as well, so youd a lot of painting and decorating – fences and gardens and stuff like that – going on. “People were happy there was a local business still operating, because a lot of the bigger hardware stores had closed.     “It got to the stage when it was hard to source materials because suppliers were closed until June time, but people were happy enough to occupy their time. They had nothing  to do.” The remains of Quigleys Mill, Park. Parks postal area recorded an increase in Covid cases last week, and despite the attachment to Derry city skewing the numbers, Greg admits there is still a degree of worry locally. “The majority of the population feel we still have to be serious about this. Its drilled into everybody at this stage, like putting your seatbelt on in the car,” he says. “The worry now is were straddling the Donegal border to a certain extent and case numbers are very high either side of it. “There is more positivity now than there was maybe six weeks ago though. Society is opening up again, and the vaccinations are a positive thing.” Covid has taken its toll on rural le too, and compliance with regulations has come at a social cost for village communities. “Where were based is very much a rural area, with a lot of the farming community and tradesmen and stuff,” says Greg. “You get some people who, by chance, meet up outside the shop here and have an opportunity to have a chat that maybe havent seen each other in a few months. “Those guys would have been at markets or farm meets every week, or pubs, but now you see them sitting out there for half an hour chatting to each other. “The social aspect, face to face, is the biggest thing. “The local community group have done a lot of work with the walkways there over the past number of years, which is very good.” Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty from Learmount Community Development Group. The local community group to which Greg refers is Learmount Community Development Group, which is nestled down a lane next to the entrance to Learmount Forest. Over the last year, Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty have noticed a big increase in people using Parks hidden gem. “We would have come down here some mornings and that car park would be full,” says Caroline. “Our secret Learmount Forest isnt a secret any more, and thats great, because everybody wants out, and weve had drop-ins coming from that.” “The forest has been fantastic for people being able to get out and safely meet their neighbours,” adds Catriona. “Theyll maybe call in at quiet times to have a socially distanced cup of tea. That social aspect has been missed, they are missing company and casual conversation.” Caroline feels the experience of the last year has sharpened focus on the issue of loneliness that had been hiding in plain sight. “We had a man who lives alone and had been sick for two or three days,” she says. “He hadnt been out and had no food in the house, so thankfully we were able to help with that. “You just know people are lonely and looking to get out again, but at the same time are a bit anxious about it. “Theyre happy to take the summer out of it and see what happens. There is certainly a lot of loneliness, isolation and depression though. “You could obviously be in the middle of a housing site and still be lonely, but when you see some of the people on their own, up a lane, they see nobody. They barely even see the postman now.” Working with both young and old people, the group have seen the effect the pandemic and its associated lockdowns have had on both generations.  “A lot of our work is with older people, and whilst theyre saying theyre fed up, some of them are getting a wee bit set in their ways,” says Caroline. “You just know by talking to them. We had a woman who always came in every week, even when it was bad, and she hasnt been in about two months. “Its highlighted how much we miss the social side of things, not being able to get out and meet friends. Even for the youth. “People always think all they need is their phone, because thats all theyre sitting on, but you can see now how the youth are crying out as much for social contact as any other generation.” There is hope though, that with the vaccines roll out and the upcoming warmer weather, that the group will be able to run some of their usual summer events. “We are looking at putting together a summer programme, but wed be a bit nervous ourselves about bringing a group of people into the room,” says Caroline.  “It would be perfectthere was good weather, because it will be planned outdoors. If the weather is bad, well take it over to Park hall, because its a bit bigger than here. “We have funding for dancing and music, which I think people would love to hear. Wed love to have tables out there on a nice evening, with a bit of a barbecue and a bit of music. “Youd like to think by September, we should be able to get going.” On the way back through the village, the shutters are half up on the Rio Grande as preparations continue inside. By the time you read this it will have reopened its doors. Hospitality has ed throughout the county, another step on the road to recovery. The farmers outside Greg McElhinneys store now have somewhere  to shoot the breeze. For the next few weeks at least, Covid fears will be drowned out by clink of glasses, the audible relief of the repressed socialite and the laughter of friends reunited. Dancing, however, is still prohibited under the regulations. It may need to be done across Parks Rio Grande, rather than inside it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The popular entertainer has been at the forefront of local efforts in helping vulnerable people during the crisis. Micky was invited to the Guildhall this week by Mayor Brian Tierney where he was presented with a special gt to recognise his work during the pandemic. It is the latest award for the local man. Micky also recently won a Spirit of Northern Ireland Award which recognised people who have helped other people during the last year. Micky said he was in total shock to find out about the award, but said he would be accepting it for the people of Derry. googletag.cmd.push In an interview with the Derry News last year, Micky spoke emotionally about the impact that the coronavirus crisis has had on him. When people started asking me for help I felt so emotional. It was so sad, he said. It was often at night when people had maybe had a drink and it gave them the courage to get intouch. They were so embarrassed to ask for help but I said look, this is between me and you. They put their trust in me. No one ever needs to know who got help. I will take that to my grave. googletag.cmd.push I swore to them over my mother and fathers grave that I would never speak about giving them the money. People from all over Derry got help from Donemana, from Eglinton. Nobody went without.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was impossible not to notice the atmosphere of optimism at the Lisnagelvin club recently as City of Derry re-opened after too long away, the cobwebs of covid shaken off by the camaraderie and revelry of those who have seen tough times before and come through it together. Unity has ed to the club after a few uncertain years, and as President Billy Jones greeted everyone, as Charlie McDaid walked around with his hands clasped behind his back ensuring everyone had what they needed, and as Treasurer Jim Ross sat and surveyed the club’swith satisfaction, one word sprang to mind – contentment. googletag.cmd.push Just being back at the club and back amongst friends was a huge step that the club has been waiting for, and with a brand-new competitive season approaching fast, the excitement was tangible. If anything, the cub has strengthened over the past year, with President Jones revealing that there have been over  new members joining City of Derry. “This marks the raising of the flag and I’m just delighted with the turnout,” he said. “The new members are playing with the well-established players and it’s great to have this confidence run through the club at the present time. We welcome anyone who is interested in the bowls to come up to City of Derry and you’ll be made most welcome. googletag.cmd.push “Last year, even Covid didn’t put the membership down it actually brought the membership up. More people were out and about. The garden centre is close by and I think people just put their head over the fence and seen that this was an activity that they could get into, so they came and joined us, and we were very fortunate that the numbers were so good.” There was also excited chatter about a few new star players who have joined the club… “We’re very lucky that people who have moved from other clubs have come joined us,” Billy explained. “The quality of player to come to us is very welcome and it’s very, very good for the future of City of Derry, and we have a good chance of playing for some cups in the IBA. The prospects we have would be very good this year and I’d be delightedwe could recognise some of the talent that’s in City of Derry.”      Freedom City of Derry is now in a position to play two teams in the upcoming league, and because of the signicant boost in numbers through new memberships, there is real hope of some silverware for a club that has always had the potential to go further. For former President and current Treasurer Ross, the club is about opportunity – for competition, for friendships, for peace of mind. “Last year we had no competitive bowls because of the lockdown, although we did play some friendly bowls amongst ourselves. It’s good to come up here and get a bit of freedom because it’s good for the mind,” he said. “This year we’re hoping the league will start at the end of May and the start of June. We have a club now with around  members, and we will likely have two teams in the league, an ‘A’ team and a ‘B’ team. Things are looking good,the virus continues the way it’s going. Most people here would be the older generation, although we have some new stars coming through here and we’re hoping to have a good season. “It does help with getting out and meeting with your friends and colleagues but we’re looking forward to competitive bowls again. That’s what it’s all about. It’s a great hobby. Fingers crossed it starts on schedule. This is our official opening day and we’ve had such a great turnout. The weather hasn’t been that good to us, but the turnout has been great.” Bowling has always been on the periphery of sport in Derry, a real niche market compared to the more glamourous sports that attract a large percentage of the youngsters in the city. Bowling is very much a generational game though and the potential to expand and grow is there more than ever for City of Derry. “Clubs like Ballymoney, Coleraine and Limavady have what they call an academy and they have young fellas coming from schools straight into the teams, but we don’t have that facility,” Jim continues. “We don’t have that facility here, but we would love to have it. It’s hard for us to attract the young people because most of us are the older generation, but we have one or two star players who are younger, andpeople see that we’re progressing we might draw more young people. In years gone by you could have played bowls in Derry seven days a week, especially indoor. We all enjoy the outdoors, and everyone is excited to get it open again and get it done. They are all waiting to see the teams picked so they can get into competitive bowls again.”  Mixed bowls for the first time For the first time in the club’s history, this year will see women integrated into the league, a recent law change permitting mixed teams, opening up yet another door for those who love the game. For Jim, this move only strengthens the club even further. “Women can now join our club and take part which wasn’t the case before,” he revealed. “We had a separate ladies’ team here but they were struggling for numbers. The governing bodies changed the rules and said that women can play with men now and take part in the leagues as equals That strengthens us, especiallyyou have a good lady bowler. We’re quite happy to have them. “Doors are opening that haven’t before, and of course we are all cross-community- it doesn’t matter what colour or what creed you are, we’re just happy to have you. If you can walk and throw a bowl then we want you. “We have some great new signings. We were never top of the league but we were always sort of in the middle of the league but I think this year we could have a very good year, and maybe even get a bit of silverware.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In years gone by you could have played bowls in Derry seven days a week, especially indoor. We all enjoy the outdoors, and everyone is excited to get it open again and get it done. They are all waiting to see the teams picked so they can get into competitive bowls again.”  Mixed bowls for the first time For the first time in the club’s history, this year will see women integrated into the league, a recent law change permitting mixed teams, opening up yet another door for those who love the game. For Jim, this move only strengthens the club even further. “Women can now join our club and take part which wasn’t the case before,” he revealed. “We had a separate ladies’ team here but they were struggling for numbers. The governing bodies changed the rules and said that women can play with men now and take part in the leagues as equals That strengthens us, especiallyyou have a good lady bowler. We’re quite happy to have them. “Doors are opening that haven’t before, and of course we are all cross-community- it doesn’t matter what colour or what creed you are, we’re just happy to have you. If you can walk and throw a bowl then we want you. “We have some great new signings. We were never top of the league but we were always sort of in the middle of the league but I think this year we could have a very good year, and maybe even get a bit of silverware.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As well as being part of a major community development in Creggan which will bring the club’s facilities into the st century, the club have recently unveiled an U girls team, while their senior team heads into the Neal Carlin Cup final against Glack this weekend. Ciaran Wilkinson, part of the Dolan’s team which won the treble back in , is in as manager for the first time, and, following victories over Limavady Reserves, Drum and Faughanvale Reserves, they are just one game away from silverware. googletag.cmd.push It would be a nice way to begin a managerial career that ‘Wilkie’ never, ever saw coming. “I never thought about it but when your body doesn’t let you play anymore, it’s a close second,” he said. “I was just asked would I like to do it and I jumped at it, and got my team around me and that was it. “I’m enjoying the challenge to be honest. It’s nothing compared to playing, but I’m enjoying it. It’s still very early and things are going well, but it always is when you are getting results. It’s only pre-season, it’s not the league or the Championship, but it’s going alright.” googletag.cmd.push Ciaran has his own ideas of how he wants to manage, insisting he wants to change the mindsets of the players to help them realise their potential. “I want boys to believe in their own ability and back themselves,” he explained. That was me as a player no matter who you are up against in that ision, you have to back yourself, so it’s just a matter of getting the players to believe that they are good enough and against anyone in that ision, they’ll give them a game not to fear anybody andyou approach every game like that you have a good a chance as they do.”     Glack are tomorrow night’s opponents, reaching Celtic Park by defeating Craigbane Reserves, Magilligan and Steelstown Reserves. Whilst the silverware would be nice, there is something more important for the new Dolans manager. “I just want them to enjoy it more than anything,” he admitted. “You don’t get to finals every whiparound. I never enjoyed it much as a player, soanything, I’m hoping to get the players to enjoy it win, lose or draw. That’s why we’re playing the game at the end of the day it’s not always about winning. Of course, it would be nice to win, and it’s better when you’re winning, but I’m just drilling it into them to enjoy it. I didn’t win anything until I was almost finished, and I wish I had enjoyed it more, soI can get them to enjoy it, without us focusing on the win, I’ll be happy enough with that to be honest.”  Notable addition A notable addition to the Dolans coaching staff this year is that of Ciara McGurk, someone who knows all about winning due to her success in recent years for both club and county. Still a player with Steelstown, Ciara has now stepped into the coaching side of the game, and such is her reputation in the game, that Wilkinson sees it as a huge benefit to have her as part of the team. The addition of a female coach at senior level adds something dferent he believes. “Ciara is there on merit,” he said. “I have watched her up close and from afar and she’s a great coach. She’s passionate and she brings a set of skills to the table. There’s not many people around the town has that experience or those medals. It’s great. I didn’t even have to think about it when I was asked. It was just about thinking outside the box, and she’s capable, and the fact that she’s a girl didn’t even come into it. It’s what she brings to it and she’s there on merit.” Geoffrey McGonigle, manager of the  treble-winning team, has also agreed toto the coaching set-up at Dolans, meaning there is no shortage of winning experience at the club this year.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His -year playing career ended on the Evergreens in the early s.Joersquos role as match secretary for twenty years was absolutely crucial given his unique ability to dig out players when all seemed lost, recruiting players at Down High on Saturday mornings to fulfil fixtures later that day.Complete strangers would often turn up for second  matches in the early days saying that Joe had instructed them to turn up and play.Despite his tireless work on behalf of the club, Joersquos greatest pleasure throughout his rugby le has been the friends he has made along the way.A keen tourist, he has travelled the world to follow rugby and even took in some of the Lions fixtures in South Africa in .He was tour manager on the legendary  Ballynahinch tour of Canada, as well as partaking in a few trips away with the Evergreens.When promotion to the All-Ireland League was secured in , Joe was a regular spectator at games all over the country and could be seen at every first XV home fixture in his familiar spot on the m line until very recently.The flat cap, long navy Adidas coat, familiar cough and half pint of Harp should conjure up an image of Joe to everyone who knows him, and to countless others who have passed through the Ballynahinch club in recent years not knowing the huge influence he has had on their rugby.Joe is the recipient of the coveted Spence Cup this season. He is truly deserving of this award and it is le-affirming to see that friendships gained through team sports run deep as Sam Robinson, himself a Spence Cup winner, acts as carer for Joe as his health deteriorates.Rugby it seems, is giving something back to one of itrsquos finest local servants.On behalf of the Spence family, Emma Rice commened: ldquoThe Spence Cup is given to a member who shows an example of commitment to the rugby club. Joe Carlislersquos service to the club in time and deed epitomises this.ldquoA society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they will never sit in. We are often guilty of not noticing a tree that gives the shade we sit under, she continued.ldquoPlayers of today may no longer see as much of that familiar face on the m line at Ballymacarn Park, but they will see the roots, the structure, the shade and benefit from what wee Joe once planted. Thank you and congratulations, Joe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Business.jpg","title":"Business owners join forces in their love of baking  ","story":"THEY became virtual supporters of each otherrsquos business during lockdown mdash now two women bakers are working together to raise money for dementia research.Ciara Van Vogt, the owner of Margaretrsquos Cottage BB in Ardglass and Sharon Campbell from Mrs Crsquos Home Kitchen in Dundrum, have raised pound, so far for the Alzheimerrsquos Society from an online bake sale.They supported each otherrsquos business efforts through lockdown last year by connecting on social media but did not meet in person until March.When they did, the two ladies struck up an immediate friendship and decided to put their skills together and collaborate on a project.Sharon said: ldquoDuring lockdown charities have really suffered and there are many worthy causes out there, we both agreed it was hard to support just one.ldquoBoth businesses support their own inidual local charities and will continue to do, but we chose to support an Alzheimerrsquos charity because we both know many people affected by this awful disease.Ciara is a carer for her elderly mother, Mrs Eithne Fitzsimons, who was diagnosed with Alzheimerrsquos disease four years ago.ldquoI lose a bit of Mum every week, and sometimes Mum doesnrsquot know who I am, said Ciara.ldquoLockdown has stopped support groups and activities for people with dementia. Itrsquos been very challenging for carers and their loved ones, and people often forget that carersrsquo lives are adversely affected too.ldquoImagine having a spouse or parent who no longer recognises you and who due to this awful disease you no longer recognise.One of the things that resonates with both women is the thought of any loved one losing all our precious memories.Ciara continued: ldquoResearch into the causes of, and treatment for dementia is critically important but not a priority for UK governments.ldquoWe would love to see this dreadful disease eradicated for future generations. We both have strong ties to Northern Ireland, being from here, although we both spent time living and working in England and Scotland before moving home to settle back in Co Down. Our mutual love of baking and cooking was how we met and became friends.The two bakers organised a virtual bake sale to raise money for dementia research.However they soon realised that due to geography not everyone could buy their fabulous baking, so they set up a JustGiving page to run alongside the bake sale.ldquoPlanning the challenges of a bake sale during lockdown was fun, so too was choosing some of our most popular products to sell to raise money, said Sharon.ldquoThe menu proved so popular. Within ten days we both realised we wouldnrsquot get much sleep as baking for Alzheimerrsquos became a top priority.Early mornings and late nights meant that customers received their sweet treats and funds are still being raised by the pair.If you want to check out their Just Giving page, details are: https:www.justgiving fundraising sharonandciarasbakesale and both ladies can be found on Facebook and Instagram..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Campbell.jpg","title":"Campbell on form as Duns claim derby win  ","story":"DUNDRUM firsts defeated derby rivals Downpatrick by  runs on Friday evening to continue their push for a semi-final spot in the T Shield.Dundrum travelled to the Strangford Road after their pitch was deemed unplayable after heavy rain with the home side winning the toss and, on a cold damp evening, chose to field first.Dundrum opened with Greg Hutley and Stuart Campbell while Downpatrick opened the bowling with Justin Rea and Marty Gartland.Dundrum got off to a fast start adding  for the first wicket inside the first six overs before Hutley was dismissed for  off the bowling of Gartland.Dundrumrsquos run rate began to halt as a result of the combination of good Downpatrick bowling and a slow outfield.Terry Hutley and Campbell added  for the next wicket before Dundrum lost four quick wickets in the form of Campbell , Hutley , James Martinand Joel Maguire .This left Dundrum  for five with Downpatrick on top as Ian Wright and Gavin McNerlin added  for the next wicket before another clump of wickets fell to leave Dundrum  for nine after  overs.McNerlin managed to get Dundrum to  for nine from their  overs as he finished on  not out.The pick of the Downpatrick bowlers was James Ferguson who finished with figures of  for  from his four overs and the game was very much in the balance heading into the second innings.Downpatrick opened with brothers Michael and Daniel Carson whilst Dundrum elected to open the bowling with Davy Glover and Daniel Kearsley.Similar to Dundrumrsquos innings, Downpatrick got off to a fast start, putting on  for the first wicket inside the first six overs.The Downpatrick men combined well and began running fluently between the wickets to put the pressure on the Dundrum bowlers.Daniel Carsonwas dismissed off the bowling of Davy Glover after a good catch by Andrew Foster in the dee, with Paul Linehan next to the crease to join Michael Carson.Linehan looked to be aggressive, hitting a big six to keep the pressure on Dundrum as the two batsmen took the score to  for  inside nine overs.However, Dundrum began to fight back through Campbell and McNerlin. The former dismissed both Carson and Linehan in the same over to swing the match back in favour for Dundrum.This started a Downpatrick collapse with the last eight wickets falling for only  runs. McNerlin finished with figures of  for  from four overs while Campbell finished with  for  from his four overs, completing a -run win for Dundrum.It was a fantastic fight back for Dundrum and Downpatrick will know they let the game get away from them.Dundrum would like to thank Downpatrick Cricket Club for hosting the game with the match ball sponsored by Aiden McCabe from AMC building.Dundrum -Downpatrick  all outT SHIELD.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Despair.jpg","title":"Despair for Down in second defeat  ","story":"DOWN were second best to a Meath side who ran out comfortable winners by a margin of seven points at Armaghrsquos Athletic Grounds on Sunday.Down were forfeiting their home advantage as a result of breaching the GAArsquos Covid- regulations during lockdown and perhaps that, coupled with the torrid weather conditions, attributed to their performance.Paddy Tally signicantly reshuffled his starting line-up following their opening day defeat against Mayo in Castlebar.The Down manager made a total of five changes, with goalkeeper Marc Reid and captain Darren OrsquoHagan the most notable of them all.Meath began the sharper of the two sides, but Down could not fault lady luck as their opponents were reduced to  men following a Eoin Harkey black card.The red and black outfit failed to take advantage of their additional man as Meath began scoring points through Cathal Hickey, Mathew Costello and Andrew Colgan.Corey Quinn did manage to score two points before the quarter for the Mourne county, but he also failed to convert a goal scoring chance which set the tone for the afternoon.The game was not away from Down at this stage as Quinn added to his tally alongside scores from Paul Devlin and Ryan McElroy to trail by only two points at half-time.It was a reverse in roles for the second half, as this time it was Down player Jonny Flynn who was shown the black card, leaving his side down a man.Unlike Down, Meath took full advantage of the extra shirt on the pitch and Cillian OrsquoSullivan buried two goals just before and after the third quarter to put the contest out of sight.Referee Niall Cullen was kept busy with his cards, this time displaying a red to Downrsquos Gerard McGovern to close out a miserable afternoon for Tallyrsquos men.Down now travel to Mullingar this Sunday, where they face off against Westmeath at Cusack Park.Down: M Reid P Fegan, G McGovern, P Murdock, P Laverty, D OrsquoHagan, C Mooney, R McEvoy , J Flynn, J Guinness, B OrsquoHagan , L Kerr, D Guinness, C Quinn , P Devlin .Subs: C Doherty for J Guinness , P Branagan for Mooney , S McConville for Kerr , G Collins for D OrsquoHagan , C Gough for Flynn , C McCrickardfor B OrsquoHagan , D Savage for Quinn Meath: A Colgan , S Lavin, C McGill, C Hickey , E Harkin, S McEntee, D Keogan, B Menton, P Harnan, E Devine , B McMahon , M Costello , J Morris , T OrsquoReilly , C OrsquoSullivan .Subs: R Ryan for Harkin , J Wallace for OrsquoReilly , E Wallacefor Hickey , J Scully for McMahon , J Conlon for Morris , D Campion for OrsquoSullivan , G McCoy for McEntee Referee: Niall Cullen Down -Meath -NFL DIVISION A.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Dozens.jpg","title":"Dozens walk in memory of Seaforde Special Olympian  ","story":"UPWARDS of  people took part in a charity walk around Castlewellan Lake on Saturday in memory of Seaforde man Glenn McBride, who died  weeks ago.Glennwas a medalled Special Olympics competitor who enjoyed soccer and basketball, playing both to a high standard.He was a popular member of of Down Special Olympics Club in Downpatrick and Shimna Stars Special Olympics Club in Newcastle.Glenn won a soccer gold medal with Team Down at the Area Games in Belfast in  and was a member of the Ulster soccer team at the Ireland Games the following year.

But also to strengthen school community and pride in our fantastic school.Mr Austin paid tribute to the schools PTFA for its fundraising, to the board of governors for support and a group of volunteers who worked on the welcome garden.ldquoThe team spirit that has been displayed throughout this project has been uplting and a reflection of the strong school community that exists within St Colmcilles Primary School, he said.ldquoThe board of governors have supported this project throughout and are committed to a cycle of continuous improvement of all aspects of the school, especially its facilities and resourcesHe continued: ldquoThe PTFA have fundraised relentlessly through organising ious raffles, draws, bingos and hampers.

So far, they have contributed pound, to the project which has allowed us to go the extra mile with more extensive resources and a very high spec finish in the ious areas.He said that the welcome garden was created almost exclusively by volunteers such as grandparent Stephen Vaughan, who built the planter boxes, the garden furniture was designed and constructed by brothers Lawrence and Gareth Blaney, the circular stone planter built by parent Fergus Rooney , grounds work was carried out by Pascal Magee and planting by Bill Carew. Plants and shrubs were provided at a discounted rate from Cunningham Flowers in Dundrum.The schoolrsquos head of outdoor education, Sean McReynolds, oversaw the project with building supervisors Brian Tweedie and Bill Carew, classroom assistant Ryan Craig and Gemma Vaughan, the schoolrsquos eco co-ordinator.Parent Roisin McKenna, who along with Andrea McMenamin, Natasha Shields and Rosaleen Cunlfe leads the PTFA committee, said that they had enjoyed ldquoamazing support from parents, the wider school community and local businesses.Roisin said: ldquoThe ethos of our PTFA is about \"making memories\" and this is always at the forefront of our fundraising. We wanted the money we raised to benefit every child in the school and therefore the school have all the children timetabled for outdoor learning everyday.ldquoThis makes our fundraising all worthwhile when you see happy children playing daily outdoors.The PTFA organised fundraising initiatives like bingo, raffles, hampers and draws which have allowed the school to further develop the footprint of the planned facilities for the children.The schoolrsquos Rainbow garden includes a tepee, a water wall for directing and controlling the flow of water, an activity table, a water and sand tray, outdoor shelter, sensory plants with a vivid colour or smell and plastic coated activity table where children can paint use sand and textiles to show their learning.Therersquos also an outdoor classroom which can hold up to  pupils and adults with bespoke seating and a blackboard with outdoor musical equipment.Itrsquos contained within ranch style fencing and is very popular with all the schoolrsquos pupils, particularly those within its learning support centres, many of whom have complex sensory needs.The new play park contains swings, slide, climbing tower, monkey bars, balance equipment, ropes, seesaws seating and planting areas.Children are timetabled at break and lunch times and for certain lessons throughout the day.An eye-catching circular stone planter has been filled with a iety of shrubs and trees in the new Welcome garden.Therersquos also a bespoke reading area overlooking four large rectangular sleeper planter boxes filled with beautul summer flowers, a solar powered water fountain, a bird bath and bird tables..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Politicians.jpg","title":"Politicians gather to mark Northern Ireland centenary  ","story":"CROSSGAR marked Northern Irelandrsquos centenary on Monday with a special event.A number of local politicians including South Down MLA Harry Harvey and Rowallane councillors Billy Walker, Terry Andrews, Robert Burgess and Kathryn Owen met in the village square with each holding a torch which symbolised what happened in Crossgar a century ago when the province was formed.On that occasion, a bonfire was lit in the square by local residents to celebrate the creation of Northern Ireland on election night of the new parliament.The local MP was Sir James Craig, the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland who had personal ties to Crossgar and had been its Westminster MP since .To mark the national and local event, local politicians from all parties were invited to hold a flame in a triangular shape on Monday symbolising the fire that was lit on the birth of the country in .Cllr Walker said he was delighted to have been invited to Crossgar to take part in the special event to mark Northern Irelandrsquos th birthday..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Tributes.jpg","title":"Tributes paid to Down Rec soccer legend Jim Connolly  ","story":"JIM Connolly died on April  after a hard fought two year battle with illness.His passing was marked by a phenomenal level of tributes.Social media,work colleagues, team-mates and opponents alike expressed how well liked and respected he was in all walks of le.He was first and last a family man whether it was his brothers and sisters, Angie and his children or his beloved grandchildren.However Coot, as he was known, had another family which he held dear. He had been a vital cog in the Down Rec team which enjoyed great success in the late Seventies.But it was and remains the case that the Down Rec experience is defined by the enduring friendships which have stood the test of time.Coot grew up in Stream Street and the reason he knocked back opportunities to perform at levels his talent merited may well lie there.That part of Downpatrick had three working class housing developments, Ardpatrick and Russell Park with Stream Street and Ibrox Park in the middle.Ibrox was their playground, the place where Coot first kicked a football.He was a Stream Street kid and it seems he never wanted to be anything .When Jim Prior took him to Down Rec, it was a marriage made in heaven.In that dressing room you had another more senior Stream Street kid. Coot would have idolized Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran in those days as he was the leader of the pack.Russell Park resident Barney Fitzsimmons was there too, a swashbuckling goalscorer who enjoyed something akin to Roy of the Rovers status at the time.Then you had the late great Paddy lsquoGeordyrsquo Galbraith, who combined a hard man reputation with a heart of gold.Peter Mulhall was another player he would have admired, a winner who proved the perfect centre back partner for the laid-back Coot.The total respect he had for them was accorded to all of us even though he was a better player than any of us. That was Coot Connolly.Prior realized that he needed to recruit from outside Downpatrick to fulfill his ambitions for the club and over a period of time he recruited players from Portaferry, Strangford, Ardglass, Dundrum, Crossgar, Saintfield, Killyleagh and Ballygowan.They were brought in for their ability but Jim couldnrsquot have known that the erse personalities therein would create the perfect storm in the dressing room.Neither could he have anticipated the level of support which flowed from those villages in the seasons to come.Dressing rooms are bastions of banter and slagging and with Dart jester-in chief, the group relished every minute they spent together.The five strong Portaferry contingent proved to be a vital ingredient, their earthy Ards humour and the opportunities their accents provided for slagging sealing their popularity.Jackie Leckey and Barney Ross brought another dimension willing as they were to join in the shenanigans on and off the pitch. Coot loved the craic and happily joined in the banter.However, he left the slagging to other less sensitive creatures of which there were plenty.A good example was the time I decided to get the footballers perm which was in vogue at the time. I should have known better.I got slaughtered, Dart declaring that I looked more like Shirley Temple than Kevin Keegan.Those were the days, as the saying goes, but happily there were plenty of good days ahead of us.We have had many reunions with Coot, an ever present and every one of them underlined the strength of the bond we enjoy so much.Sadly those reunions tend to be confined to wakes and funerals nowadays and the baby of our team has now joined Shane Breen, Paddy Galbraith and Marty Ross on the sidelines.Coot would have been the first to remind me that the Rec wasnrsquot only about the players.The one and only Charlie Oakes was highly influential in his role as assistant manager, while Austy Keating doubled as chairman and groundsman for many years.Joe Lyttle was our physio and his son Joea loyal player for years while my sister Tina was a committee member and a fanatical fan.They were all fully paid up members of the Rec family and we continue to mourn their loss.I would love to have name checked every single member of the Rec family in this piece but time and space didnrsquot allow. My apologies.The laughter which rang through Cootrsquos house during his wake was a fitting farewell for someone who loved to laugh.He was a very special human being. We will miss him forever.

Access should only be restrictedany confidential information is discussed. If any person considers that access to meetings is being restricted unnecessarily, their first step should be to approach the council with these concerns.But access remained denied, so the Minister was asked to amend legislation around this sticking point.A spokesperson replied: ldquoGiven legislation currently allows public press access to committees and subcommittees subject to the exclusions previously advised, the Department is not at this time considering making amendments.This was shared with councillors, with all who replied commenting positively around press attendance.Councillor Barry McElduff, Sinn Fein formally called for press to be permitted access to Health Group meetings and Chief Executive Alison McCullagh suggested this could be achieved by upgrading to subcommittee status.Following unanimous agreement in December, BBC Local Democracy enquired when this could be expected, and were advised it was part of an ongoing review.The matter arose last week, and what started out as a victory for democracy, quickly dwindled when members learned upgrading meant quota rules of membership would apply.Councillor Emmet McAleer, Independent suggested retaining working group status, but opening meetings to public and press, but the Chair Councillor Stephen McCann replied: ldquoThat conversation has been had a number of times and we are aware why that cannot happen. However it was given extra clout as a subcommittee, I understand the press would have access. That would address some concerns members have raised in the past.The Chief Executive stressed: ldquoThe only dference is Standing Orders apply in subcommittees, therefore press and public would have normal access.Current Health Group member Councillor Donal OrsquoCofaigh, Independent, acknowledged subcommittee status would cost him his place under the quota, but nonetheless was willing to agreeit meant public and press access.SDLP Councillor Mary Garrity said: ldquoIf itrsquos not legislatively enforceable, we come upon this quandary, whether we like it or not.However she felt working group status meant reporting back to full council and: ldquoAbsent the press, we would still get all our concerns highlighted.The Chief Executive confirmed: ldquoActions would be reported, irrespective of working group or subcommittee status.Councillor Josephine Deehan, Independent found it: ldquoRegrettable we didnrsquot have information regarding legislative requirements prior to making this decision. Irsquom concerned that members of small parties and independents would be excluded. I strongly believe in inclusion and as elected members we have a duty to represent our constituents.She added: ldquoTherersquos not a huge amount of dference between a subcommittee and a working group. In terms of involving the press and public, we would have the opportunity to raise issues at standing committees.Proposing retention of the current working group status to ensure inclusivity and current membership, Councillor Deehan said: ldquoThe only dference is access to the public and press hellipRepresentation and input from members is more important and should be the greater priority.This was seconded by Councillor Garrity.Councillor McElduff requested clarity around press access noting: ldquoObviously where possible, when we arenrsquot talking about issues which are confidential, wersquod want to err on the side of openness and transparency.The Chief Executive pointed to legislation in which: ldquoThere is no provision for press or public to attend working group meetings.Councillor Adam Gannon, SDLP noted the Health Group was: ldquoLooked at to change into a subcommittee because some members wanted it opened to the press. Whilst it would be nice to have public access to everything, it may not always happen and canrsquot always be that way.Concluding the discussion, he said whatever the status of the group: ldquoThe work is still being done. It would be nice for the public to be present, but we donrsquot need the press there to do our work. I know I donrsquot.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He notes the view seen from his home on the shores of Belfast Lough. The Mull of Gallowayless than  miles away. The Mournes, some  miles away. Holywood where John, king of England, lord of Ireland, duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, and Earl of Anjou, stayed a night in  after crossing the Lough from Carrickfergus Castle built in  by the Norman, John de Courcy. The sailors who had brought the king from Bayonne, long before nation states had come into being, were tipped  shillings.He notes the Castlereagh Hills without mentioning Robert Stewart at  a member of the Irish Parliament for Down, who when ennobled as Viscount Castlereagh took his title from the hills near his home.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...He had shown leanings towards the Belfast United Irishmen – enough for the founder, William Drennan, to see in him a young hopeful. A visit to France and what he saw of the aftermath of the French Revolution changed Stewart’s mind. He saw the choice for the ills of the Kingdom of Ireland either a parliamentary union with Great Britain or incorporation into the French Napoleonic Empire, for French troops once landed in Ireland would never leave. An opponent of Castlereagh and the proposed Union was the Marquis of Downshire, a prominent Orangeman.Castlereagh failed to achieve all he had hoped for in the Union . But Belfast was able to take advantage of access to new markets the Union opened and grew from some , inhabitants into an industrial city of over , a century later.Castlereagh became British Foreign Secretary – admired today by Henry Kissinger and William Hague for diplomatic skills as a negotiator at the Congress of Vienna aimed at keeping the peace in Europe. His home in County Down is now a National Trust property.Alexander Stewart, Castlereagh’s grandfather was an elder in what at the time would have been Rosemary Street Meeting House, today’s Rosemary Street Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church.His son John, the father of Castlereagh, conformed to the Church of Ireland making possible the election of his son Robert to the Irish parliament.On a wall close by the church a Blue Plaque notes William Drennan’s birthplace and the history column in the street outside the church records his United Irishmen connection but has no note, surely somewhat odd, given the tourists, of the Stewarts, Castlereagh’s family links.But then neither does the history notes in front of St Patrick’s Roman Catholic Church in Donegall Street record that Castlereagh was amongst the subscribers to the building cost of the earlier chapel on the site. It is not only Castlereagh who is forgotten by Belfast. There is no Blue Plaque above the entrance to Pottinger’s Entry off Anne Street to indicate that the first governor of Hong Kong, Sir Henry Pottinger was born there.WA Miller, Belfast BT——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They are all big boys and girls who can make up their own minds and gave their own say.”Speaking at the event, Mr Poots said: “It’s a bit unreal to be perfectly honest.”Outgoing leader Arlene Foster left before Mr Poots took to the stand to make his inaugural speech as leader, as did other senior figures including Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Gavin Robinson, Diane Dodds and Gregory Campbell.Mr Poots paid tribute to Ms Foster’s leadership of the party.He said: “I want to take an opportunity also to pay tribute to my predecessor.“I know that the last few weeks has been dficult for her, as they have been for all of us.“But I can’t say honestly that no matter what background or place we come from, Arlene is and will be regarded as one of the most foremost women and unionists in British politics.“Irrespective of our dferences in any issues that have brought us here this evening, she is admired by us all.“She has made history, and her time in politics. I have no doubt she will go on to do even greater things. History will ultimately be kind to her in its final analysis. I wish her and her family well.”It comes after the DUP Fermanagh and Tyrone Association released a statement expressing its “disgust” at the treatment of outgoing leader Mrs Foster.Mrs Foster announced her resignation as First Minister and DUP leader last month following an internal revolt against her leadership.Four weeks on, Mrs Foster this week said she has still not had sight of a letter reportedly signed by party colleagues asking her to step aside.Fermanagh and Tyrone DUP Association posted a statement on its Facebook page – shared by MP Gavin Robinson – which stated the treatment of Mrs Foster “was not done in our name” and pledged to “stand firm by her side”.Mrs Foster said she would step down as DUP leader on Friday and as First Minister at the end of June.Mr Poots has signalled that he will become the first DUP leader not to take the First Minister position at Stormont, and will instead nominate a colleague in order to focus on the job of leading the party.MLAs Mervyn Storey and Paul Givan are reportedly being considered for the post.  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularEx-DUP MLA: Arlene Foster has undermined the Union and NI is in a dangerous place – but a united Ireland could workArlene Foster awarded six figure sum in damages from TV presenter Dr. Christian JessenAllister turns question on speeding into Bobby Storey funeral barbDUP member dramatically resigns from party after Edwin Poots ratied as leader Ireland shows itself to be Europe’s most anti-Israel nationMost PopularI hope this sentence brings you comfort, judge tells family, as she jails drink driver who killed friend in head-on smashTV presenter doctor Christian Jessen replied LOL when warned Arlene Foster tweet was  and defamatoryIt is now time for those murdered by the IRA also to get full legacy inquestsPeter Tatchell defends NI street preachers under investigation by PSNI for ‘hate incidents’Edwin Poots is ratied as DUP leader as key figures leave meeting before speech                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kafWEX sc-feJyhm dbjzDR\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedFashion and BeautyDealsHome and GardenPublic NoticesFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt was girl power when ten female walkers joined Joy and sheepdog Bracken from Penarth and District Ramblers at Penarth clftop for an . mile walk, with no stiles only gates and which would see them experiencing the weather of all four seasons in one day. They set off on a socially distanced walk in lovely spring sunshine across the old pitch and putt course before joining part of the old railway line, now a walk and cycle way, and heading through a built up area Lavernock Road led them into Cosmeston Country Park.Past the eastern lake with its floating jetty where canoes can be safely launched and making their way through the eastern paddock with its carpet of pretty cowslips, open meadows led them towards Old Cogan Hall Farm, where they deviated into the churchyard of St Peterrsquos for morning break in glorious warm sunshine reminiscent of summer. Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMore than  local people are urging the Cardf and Vale University Health Boardto build a health centre on Eagleswell Road, where a former primary school closed in .The disused plot of land is currently owned by Vale of Glamorgan council, and is allocated for  potential houses in the local development plan.But campaigners want the council to allow the health board to build a new health centre there, complaining the townrsquos current surgeries arenrsquot up to scratch.Councillor Gwyn John, of the Llantwit First Independent party, is organising the petition. He raised concerns that the hundreds of new houses in and around Llantwit Major arenrsquot seeing the increased investment in local public services needed to cater for the growing population.He said: ldquoThere are more and more houses in the town. Therersquos hardly any green space left and our services are really struggling.Two doctors surgeries currently cater for the town: Coastal Vale and Western Vale. Cllr John claimed Coastal Vale is ldquoat capacity and the Western Vale building is ldquoover  years old.He said: ldquoThe actual building needs replacing, itrsquos not in a great condition. It needs replacing and modernising.Cardf and Vale UHB is drawing up plans for major changes on how clinical services are delivered. This will likely see three lsquohealth and wellbeing centresrsquo with services like x-rays, out-of-hours GPs, community mental health teams, and ambulatory care.MORE NEWS:The health board is also planning nine lsquowellbeing hubsrsquo, either developing existing places like health centres, leisure centres or libraries or in new buildings such as Maelfa in Cardf. These wellbeing hubs will include GP services, midwery, and primary mental health care.     The idea is to move clinical services away from large hospitals like the University Hospital of Wales, at the Heath in Cardf, avoiding the need for people to travel long distances for care.Cllr John supports this move but says residents in the western part of the Vale of Glamorgan are currently undeserved with health services mdash and with the hundreds of new houses being built in the area, Llantwit would be ideal for a new health centre.He is hoping to get many more signatures for his petition to build the new health centre in Llantwit Major, with a table set up on the precinct in the town on Saturday, for residents who arenrsquot on the internet or havenrsquot seen the campaign online yet.He said: ldquoItrsquos all very well building homes, thatrsquos fine. But we have to have the infrastructure.The health board said any investment in new health and wellbeing centres or wellbeing hubs is some time away.A Cardf and Vale UHB spokesperson said: ldquoThe intention is for a wellbeing hub to be placed in the western Vale, but this may be some years away as part of our overall plan. In terms of where the site will be based, this will be subject to an engagement process.ldquoThere will be a health and wellbeing centre in the Vale work will be commencing in terms of engagement in relation to this within the next few months.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoAny need for a new medical centre would be a matter for the Cardf and Vale University Health Board.ldquoNo planning application for such a building has been submitted and currently the land in question has been allocated as a signicant strategic development site for the councilrsquos house building programme.

Restoring, re-energising, not grandstanding or issuing threats or warnings. vw,vw,px, px\"First Minister Arlene Foster ldquoOur institutions are not a bargaining chip in our campaign to get rid of the protocol.ldquoWe will consistently roll back the objectional provisions of the protocol, as we have been doing.ldquoThat involves arguing our case forcefullyand with conviction. It involves making Brussels and Dublin aware that the protocol is intolerable and unworkable.ldquoLegal challenges are one correct tactic, but the guaranteed way of reading our sales of the isive protocol is through the Assembly.He added: ldquoWe will employ political tactics to continue the pressure, and let Dublin see that isnrsquot some hiccup, but rather something that has the worrying capacity to destabilise relationships that they have gained most from.Mr Poots said his challenge was to encourage supporters of unionism to get out and vote.He said: ldquoBy far the biggest enemy is those unionists who do not care enough to come out and vote. We must be the Unionist party that inspires them to reengage and get out to vote.Mr Poots called for a ldquounited unionist coalition ahead of the next Assembly elections.He said the only way of preventing a border poll and getting rid of the protocol was by securing a Unionist majority at the next election.     In signs of growing isions in the party, outgoing leader Arlene Foster left before Mr Poots took to the stand to make his inaugural speech as leader, as did other senior figures including Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Gavin Robinson, Diane Dodds and Gregory Campbell.Paul Bell, a DUP member of  years from Ms Fosterrsquos Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency, dramatically resigned from the party after Mr Pootsrsquo ratication.He hit out at those who ousted the First Minister, and warned the party stands to lose thousands of votes at the next election.ldquoThis is going to be a real problem for the DUP. The votes that are going to be shed by the DUP is not in their hundreds, itrsquos in their thousands. Itrsquos in their tens of thousands, he said.ldquoWe cannot go round the doors, the people in Fermanagh and South Tyrone will vote for anyone but the DUP. That is because, not of an election, that is because of what took place before the election. vw,vw,px, px\"Edwin Poots speaks to the media, after leaving the Crowne Plaza Hotel, Belfast on the evening he was ratied as the new DUP leader Asked about Mr Bellrsquos resignation, Mr Poots said: ldquoSometimes people donrsquot like the outcome and they do things in the heat of the moment.In his speech, Mr Poots paid tribute to Ms Fosterrsquos leadership of the party.He said: ldquoI want to take an opportunity also to pay tribute to my predecessor.ldquoI know that the last few weeks has been dficult for her, as they have been for all of us.ldquoBut I canrsquot say honestly that no matter what background or place we come from, Arlene is and will be regarded as one of the most foremost women and unionists in British politics.ldquoIrrespective of our dferences in any issues that have brought us here this evening, she is admired by us all.ldquoShe has made history, and her time in politics. I have no doubt she will go on to do even greater things. History will ultimately be kind to her in its final analysis. I wish her and her family well.It comes after the DUP Fermanagh and Tyrone Association released a statement expressing its ldquodisgust at the treatment of outgoing leader Mrs Foster.Mrs Foster announced her resignation as First Minister and DUP leader last month following an internal revolt against her leadership.Four weeks on, Mrs Foster this week said she has still not had sight of a letter reportedly signed by party colleagues asking her to step aside.#STATEMENT #Fermanagh and South Tyrone DUP Association met this week to voice their disgust at the manner in which ourhellipPosted by DUP Fermanagh and South Tyrone onWednesday, May , Fermanagh and Tyrone DUP Association posted a statement on its Facebook page ndash shared by MP Gavin Robinson ndash which stated the treatment of Mrs Foster ldquowas not done in our name and pledged to ldquostand firm by her side.Mrs Foster said she would step down as DUP leader on Friday and as First Minister at the end of June.Mr Poots has signalled that he will become the first DUP leader not to take the First Minister position at Stormont, and will instead nominate a colleague in order to focus on the job of leading the party.MLAs Mervyn Storey and Paul Givan are reportedly being considered for the post..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Edwin Poots officially ratied as new leader of Democratic Unionist Party  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
