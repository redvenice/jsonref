He was 25, and engaged in an all-consuming personal project to capture the essence of “the English way of life … before it becomes more Americanised”. A precocious talent, Ray-Jones had won a scholarship from the London School of Printing to study at Yale School of Art when he was 19. He befriended the freewheeling young stars of American photography, Garry Winogrand and Joel Meyerowitz, was mentored by Richard Avedon and returned home in 1965 with notebooks full of strategy. “Get more involved (talk to people),” began one typical list of these notes to self. “Stay with the subject matter (be patient). See if everything in the background relates to the subject matter. NO MIDDLE DISTANCE.”With these principles in mind, Ray-Jones took himself off in a camper van in search of Englishness. He found a good deal of it on beaches – windbreaks and frigid paddling and Thermoses balanced on shingle – and at all levels of pageantry, from Glyndebourne and the Chelsea flower show to local beauty parades and fun fairs. This photograph, in which the horse takes more interest in the cafe than the cafe takes in the horse, was typical of his eye.Tony Ray-Jones died of a sudden and aggressive leukaemia in 1972, his project unfinished. His pictures had achieved a significant following among younger photographers. Among them was Martin Parr, then a student at Manchester Polytechnic, who was “enthralled and excited” by Ray-Jones’s perfectly realised comedies of English manners and took inspiration from them in his own vocation. Parr includes this photograph in a book of Ray-Jones’s English pictures and an exhibition at his foundation. The book stands, he hopes, as a definitive tribute to Ray-Jones’s “ability to make complex images in which every element falls into place”.The English Seen by Tony Ray-Jones is at Martin Parr Foundation, Bristol, Wednesday to 21 December.

This is the question being asked across the art world about the Salvator Mundi - the first Leonardo to be discovered for more than a century - as the Louvre prepares for its blockbuster da Vinci exhibition.With just under two weeks to go before the show opens, there are now serious doubts as to whether the star of the exhibition will be included, as the Paris museum had hoped.The world’s most expensive painting, a depiction of Jesus in Renaissance dress, which sold at auction in 2017 for $450m, would draw huge crowds. Described as a devotional counterpart to the Mona Lisa, Leonardo’s most famous work, it is said to have an “extraordinary, communicative presence”.But the arts world is awash with rumours that its appearance looks unlikely. The Art Newspaper goes further and claims the painting will not feature. A spokeswoman for the Louvre told the Observer: “I confirm the Louvre has asked for the loan of the Salvator Mundi. We don’t have the answer yet and thus, don’t have any further comment.”A no show would be the latest twist in the extraordinary saga of a painting that has attracted as much controversy, intrigue and ision as it has critical acclaim. Questions over its authenticity have raged among art historians for more than a decade.Once attributed to the “school of Giovanni Boltraffio”, an early Renaissance painter who was a pupil of Leonardo, it was then upgraded to “a work by Boltraffio” when sold for £45 in 1958 at an auction in London.A New York art historian and dealer, Robert B Simon, bought it from a New Orleans auction house for just $1,175 in 2005 and it was attributed to Leonardo in 2011.Today, though, some still question the attribution although not, according to Simon, the Louvre. “I know that the painting was requested for the Louvre exhibition – and as a work by Leonardo,” he said. “But obviously the decision about whether to loan it is the owner’s to make. And I have no knowledge of his decision.”Indeed, who actually owns the painting is another source of contention. It was rumoured to be in the hands of the Abu Dhabi royal family. More recently there has been speculation that it is on the super-yacht of Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince who has been forced to deny his involvement in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.Rybolovlev alleges that Bouvier repeated the same trick with no fewer than 38 art masterworks he acquired, including paintings by Picasso, Gauguin, Klimt, Rothko and Modigliani. In a lawsuit launched against Sotheby’s for its part in what he alleges was “the largest art fraud in history”, Rybolovlev claims he was defrauded of more than $1bn.Sotheby’s, which did not return requests for comment, contests the claims, as does Bouvier.The extraordinary alacrity with which the painting’s value sky-rocketed, and the opaque circumstances surrounding its sale and ownership, have prompted calls for the art market to be more heavily regulated.“I don’t see how any art market regulation would have a bearing on the controversy surrounding the sale of the work. The sale of a valuable work of art like the Leonardo is governed by existing laws similar to and often the same as those that concern other valuable properties – whether art, gold, jewellery, land, a building, yacht, or an airplane.“The Salvator Mundi was due to appear at the Louvre museum in Abu Dhabi last year. Then, as now, its no show invited speculation as to where it was really hanging. It could be that the most expensive painting in history – and arguably the most controversial – is not on display anywhere.“I do not know where the painting is,” Simon said. “Although I had heard that some months ago it was being kept in a secure art storage facility in Switzerland.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b5db2489d214555f3820c0d6be184b9fae17995/0_285_5604_3362/master/5604.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3dbc8030e7a1831def57ee4eef70a8f8","title":"all aboard london transport seat designs in pictures","story":"As a boy, Andrew Martin’s father worked for British Rail, and he soon developed a passion for railways.

But now we’ll start to find out if all their earnest protest actually matters.Perhaps the first real test will come on 15 October, when the board of the EU’s European Investment Bank – the largest public bank in the world – meets to decide whether the time has finally come to stop expanding the fossil fuel sector. This should be a no-brainer decision: the bank’s staff has put forward a cogent proposal, supported by campaigners across the continent, that would end loans to new fossil fuel projects by 2020.That plan fits with the facts: when the world’s climate scientists declared last autumn that we would need to have fundamentally transformed our energy sector within a decade, it was clear that the first job was to stop building any new infrastructure. The first rule of holes is, when you’re in one, stop digging.And if the EIB does act, it will send a strong signal to markets and to other lenders. For almost a decade now, observers have understood that restricting the flow of money to the fossil fuel industry is a key part of the climate fight. That’s why endowments and portfolios worth more than $11tn have begun esting their fossil fuel stocks last month the University of California system became the latest big player to join in, scrubbing its $80bn endowment and pension fund of fossil fuel stocks. Heck, even a major American utility announced that it was esting its pension fund because it could see where the future lay.This kind of effort is beginning to actually pinch – Shell said last year that estment had become a material risk to its business. Lending to this industry undercuts those efforts.Ending that lending would also strengthen the growing movement to stop private banks underwriting climate destruction. The big money-centre banks, the kind that lend to governments and businesses, have stepped up their financial support for the fossil fuel industry in the years since the Paris climate agreement, but a growing citizen movement is calling them to account: last week in the US activists closed down branches of Chase Bank, the largest oil and gas lender.The EIB would also be doing a service to everyone who will be hurt financially as the fossil fuel industry founders. As the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, began warning some years ago, there are massive “stranded assets” represented by oil and gas reserves that can’t be burned if we are to meet our climate targets. This “carbon bubble” hangs over our markets like the housing bubble of a decade ago: if the EIB backs away from new fossil fuel lending, it will help with the slow deflation of that bubble, lessening pressure on the system.But the biggest reason for the EIB to take this step is simple: it responds to the cries of both young people and scientists.Researchers have looked on in anguish for many years now, as their warnings have gone largely unheeded – the results so far this year include the hottest month ever recorded on our planet, giant fires across the northern latitudes and a hurricane that stalled over the Bahamas producing what meteorologists called “the longest siege of violent, destructive weather ever observed” on our planet. The iron law of climate crisis is that those who have done the least get hurt the most, but it’s now reaching the stage where even the affluent are at risk: across California last week hundreds of thousands were without power because the state’s largest utility company shut off supplies for fear of sparking forest fires in this hot and arid autumn.Young people have looked at this data and drawn the obvious conclusion: that we must do far more than we are doing at present. They’ve done the work to understand the crisis that shadows their lives, and they’ve asked adults to join in the fight for a livable future. They’ve also said – loud and clear – that they don’t want to be patted on the head and thanked for providing an inspiring moment. They want action.Action is what the EIB can provide. Obviously there will be pressure from the oil and gas industry to keep handing over public money: that’s evident in the gas industry loopholes that have fractured the boldness of the initial proposals. What had the potential to be an unmistakable signal to the world that the end of the fossil fuel age was in sight could end up a more muddled message if the EIB bends to industry pressure.Anyone who believes in physics and chemistry knows that the time for change is here – indeed, it’s past due.The fifteenth of October is a crucial day in the most important fight the planet has ever faced, and a sign of whether Europe’s governments, particularly those of Germany and Italy, who insiders report have been strongly against a fossil-free EIB policy, will respond with open hearts to the outpouring of hope we have seen in the past weeks.• Bill McKibben is the founder of the grassroots climate campaign 350.org and author of Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19ff682916549491f4f48e22b30a6e05ad486e53/155_66_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e9d54472b19447fc159ee8fa18d8396","title":"the guardian view on john bercows departure parliament needs a bold speaker","story":"When parliament returns on Monday, John Bercow will be three weeks from retirement. These weeks are likely to be stormy. MPs could be wrestling with isive Brexit decisions right up to the Speaker’s departure on 31 October, which is also the date of the Brexit deadline. So there will be no gentle cadence about this final farewell. It may all end instead with crashing discord. That would be a fitting send-off to a Speaker who is unprecedentedly polarising but who has been Britain’s most important parliamentarian of modern times.Throughout his decade in office, Mr Bercow has been a controversial Speaker. Originally, he was a rightwing Conservative, but his views have moved to the left. His main support has come from Labour, to the dismay of his own tribe. Many Tories have never forgiven him. Some have come to detest him – a farewell snub from them remains likely. Some of the reasons are understandable. Mr Bercow is often patronising from the chair, and has been far too fond of verbose lectures to MPs. He has been accused of worse behaviour by staff, with charges (which he denies) of bullying and harassment in the Commons. Calls for new leadership have grown louder. On all these counts, there is now the overdue chance of a new start, a better working atmosphere and a tougher approach towards unacceptable behaviour.Brexit has, however, been Mr Bercow’s finest hour. Since the leave vote in 2016, he has presided over an increasingly explosive convergence of challenges to the ways in which parliament and government work. The all-encompassing nature of Brexit’s effects on Britain is one. The impact of a referendum verdict that slashes a deep gash across the sovereignty of parliament is a second. The destabilising effect of the hung parliament that was elected in 2017 is a third. The recent emergence of an unelected prime minister who is effectively at war with parliament is a fourth. Together, these events have generated isions and passions that have come close to bringing parliament to its knees. Few Speakers have faced such sustained parliamentary instability for so long. But Mr Bercow has risen to the challenge. Flawed though he is, a kind of greatness was thrust upon him by immensely difficult events.Mr Bercow is a Westminster moderniser. This remains essential work. He has opened parliament up for visitors and expanded its educational and civic presence. In the chamber, he has consistently championed backbench MPs against ministers, allowing prime minister’s questions to extend to almost an hour. He has pioneered the use of urgent questions and emergency debates, thus ensuring that big issues are debated by parliament when MPs want, not when it is convenient for ministers. On Brexit, he has become increasingly ready to allow backbenchers to challenge the claim of modern governments, even in a hung parliament, to sole control of the agenda. Sometimes it has been messy, sometimes disappointing. Occasionally, though, it has been heroic and in the deepest and best traditions of parliament. With Gina Miller, Mr Bercow has done more than anyone in modern times to ensure that the elected parliament rightly retains the authority to be the nation’s sovereign decision-maker.The question in the Speakership election on 4 November, after Mr Bercow leaves the Commons, is what comes next. By leaving now, Mr Bercow is trying to ensure his successor is not a Tory Brexiter. Many candidates are promising MPs a quieter and more comfortable life. This is worrying and wrong. Parliament is neither a club nor a conventional workplace. It is the engine house of democracy. The Brexit process has strengthened parliament, but in many eyes it has weakened its moral authority. Britain may soon face a “people v parliament” election. The country needs a dynamic parliament that embodies the people of all corners of Britain in all their multiple identities and concerns. It does not need a cowed parliament that bends the knee to a lawless government that claims other sources of authority. Mr Bercow stood up for representative democracy when it really mattered. It will still matter after he goes. Parliament needs a worthy champion, ideally without his faults, to continue his work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38b071c3525f964c2b743510ab45a5274d054b61/0_307_5191_3114/master/5191.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8868d163d4a1a699d30893d39f37eba","title":"you dont have to settle the joy of living and dying alone","story":"Data confirms more women have realized there are far worse things than dying alone, which is bad news for the patriarchyNot long ago I had a discussion with a friend about why she married, and ultimately orced, someone she knew wasn’t right for her. She said she bought into society’s deafening message that being with a man – any man – is better than being alone, and certainly better than dying alone, which is allegedly the worst fate anyone, especially any woman, can suffer.When I told her that I’ve never feared dying alone, and in fact have sometimes feared the opposite, she told me I was incredibly lucky. Because this meant I wouldn’t end up settling for a life that doesn’t actually make me happy, even if society tells me it’s supposed to.Apparently I’m not alone. (Pun intended!) Data confirms that more women have begun to realize that there are far worse things than dying alone, which is great news for women but bad news for the patriarchy.“Broke men are hurting women’s marriage prospects,” the NY Post recently declared, citing a study from the Journal of Family and Marriage. The article claimed that “most American women hope to marry” but there is a shortage of men with stable incomes and lives, making it tough for women to do so.That Twitter clash perfectly captures a growing cultural ide. There are those who still believe that traditional marriage is the natural order of things – and that those not participating in this institution are failing society, and must be desperately unhappy and lonely.Then there are the rest of us, who believe that traditional marriage is great for some, but not for everybody, and we certainly don’t feel like lonely failures for choosing to opt-out. (And yes, for many of us it is an active choice, not just an economic outcome.)Contrary to decades of prevailing wisdom that those who marry are better off, a 2017 study published in the Journal of Women’s Health found that women who stay single or who orce are actually healthier than those who stay married. By contrast, married men are healthier than men who are not. Why the discrepancy?For starters, men are less likely to go to the doctor than women, unless of course women – ie wives – nudge them. Women are also traditionally better at maintaining social networks than men. When a man orces, he may see his physical and emotional health slide. He loses the person concerned with keeping him healthy and much of his social network. By contrast, women who orce just see their relationships evolve from investing in a man to investing more heavily in other social or community connections.For years, the feminist writer Linda Hirshman courted controversy by advising that marriage, unless to an exceptional man, is often a “bad bargain” for women. With every child a woman has, she sees her pay and long-term professional opportunities decline, particularly if she leaves the workforce for a significant period of time.Furthermore, marriage has historically presented women with two options, neither good: marry a man and sacrifice your autonomy and career goals to become financially dependent on him. Or marry a man and maintain your own career but be prepared to have a “second shift” career taking care of him and the home. Even among more open-minded millennial men, the female spouse still ends up doing the majority of caregiving and housekeeping.More women, however, are foregoing marriage and motherhood. In doing so, they trade in their “second shift” and instead begin taking care of themselves. To use Hirshman’s language, they are rejecting a “bad bargain”. This new status quo frustrates men who feel entitled to female companionship, such as angry male “incels”.While trying to explain the danger of incels (“involuntary celibates”) to my mother, I was surprised to hear her say, “Well, they’re not entirely wrong.” Realizing my horror, she went on to explain that women used to need a man to survive. That led to a lot of bad marriages and deterred orces. She loves that, thanks to modern feminism, she gets to see women like me make decisions that are not predicated on needing a man to keep a roof over my head. “You don’t have to settle,” she said.Women have more economic power and freedom to set standards regarding the men they will be with, and what they will put up with from those men, than at any time in history. More women are deciding that being in a bad marriage, or trying to co-parent with an irresponsible man, is much worse than dying alone.Once dying alone is no longer scary to women, men lose power. So it shouldn’t be surprising that some incels are outraged. It’s no different than those who mourn the days when they didn’t have to compete for jobs against women and racial minorities. It must be frustrating to lose power you once had but didn’t necessarily deserve.Which is why I owe a big thank you to my mom. Despite being married for nearly 50 years, she’s never pressured me to get married (even when she’s been a fan of the man I’m dating). But the main reason I owe her thanks is because she’s never minded going to dinner by herself. Until I grew older I didn’t realize such a small act was actually strangely politically subversive. Countless adults are terrified of simply going to the movies by themselves. I increasingly think Chris Rock was right when, years ago, he joked that a lot of people marry just to have someone to go to dinner and the movies with. Funny, but sadly, probably true.It made me wonder how many people have endured unhappy relationships just so they wouldn’t be perceived as lonely. For so long, society has perpetuated the stigma that you need someone by your side to be seen as whole.But more women are dismantling this stigma and eschewing the “bad bargain”. They are finally deciding that being alone isn’t the same as being lonely. They’ve realized that they can channel the energy that for so long went into uplifting men into instead lifting themselves. That means more women staying in the workplace, more women running for office and more women grabbing their rightful seats at tables of power.That’s not to say women shouldn’t marry and have children. It is to say women should feel empowered to do so, only if they truly want to and with partners who are worthy of them, who champion and nurture their success, not hold them back or drag them down. More women are embracing that message, and that could ultimately do more for women’s equality than any government policy ever will."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b455c043fe18b3f5853ffb28b8c32f9ca4134450/0_0_2024_1213/master/2024.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2bd5d6e8b45b39542fb19513aab56863 1400w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of dawn","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘dawn’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘dawn’.Share your photos of what dawn means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 16 October at 10am.

I’ve forgotten… Do you want a banana?”I’m OK for a banana, thanks. We’re in Humphrys’s homely kitchen in his house in west London. And yes, the long-serving co-presenter of Radio 4’s Today programme has been cross with me before. About a year ago, as the Observer’s radio reviewer, I’d written an article about the Today programme that wasn’t entirely complimentary, and Humphrys had fired off an angry email at me, making some points I agreed with, and several I didn’t. I answered, and, after a bit of to-ing and fro-ing, we ended up on fairly good terms. So now, here we are. I’m armed with umpteen readers’ questions for him – many hostile, I must say – and Humphrys is all set to answer them.Now 76, wiry and fiery, dressed in cosy fleece, Humphrys finally retired from Today a week or so ago, after more than three decades at the helm during which he became the show’s best-known host. He’s published his memoirs to coincide with that retirement, and A Day Like Today is a 400-page doorstopper of a book that describes Humphrys’s early life growing up poor but proud in Splott, Wales, and moves through his career as a newspaper reporter, foreign correspondent and TV news presenter. It is very detailed on his years at Today (he joined in 1987, at the age of 43), which provide about two-thirds of the book. Though he doesn’t reveal much about his private life, he is straightforward in his opinions about other people: he doesn’t seem to like Eddie Mair or Jane Garvey very much, for instance.“Eddie Mair is a brilliant broadcaster,” he says today, “but I dislike his style of broadcasting when applied to a hard news programme. And Jane Garvey is too opinionated for my taste. You shouldn’t lace questions with your own views, and Jane tells the listener what she thinks about everything. But then it is Woman’s Hour, not Today.”This last point seems at the very least ironic, given that one reason Humphrys’s detractors dislike him is that they believe they can tell his opinion of interviewees by the way he interviews them. Humphrys argues hard to me that they can’t: though he’s assumed to be a Brexiteer, he voted remain, and he cites a time when a very good friend of his came on to Today, and Humphrys gave him a roasting. (It was Patrick Holden, then director of the Soil Association.)“I’ve known Patrick for 40 years,” he says, “and I believe in everything he’s done and does, I believe organic farming is vital, but when I interviewed him, I put the opposite argument to him. I am a devil’s advocate. That is what I do.”John Humphrys, for many, came to epitomise both the good and bad about the Today programme. His tenacious interviewing style was admired when it was used to effect against politicians but, post-Brexit, as the country ided along non-party lines, many felt that his rottweiler questioning technique was used on the wrong people. And his interviews with non-politicians – fashion journalists, artists, authors, scientists – could seem naive, even inept. In his book, he admits that, though Today’s researchers always prepared him briefs for interviews, he mostly didn’t read them. Is this true?“Yes,” he says. “I mean I am notoriously… ‘stupid’ is the only word. Mostly you don’t know what interviews you’re going to be doing until you see them, and the sensible thing to do is to sit down and read the brief very carefully. I don’t do that. It’s a sort of brinksmanship, and also I don’t want to already know the answers to my questions. Not with politicians, but if you’re talking to real people about real things – somebody who’s just swum the channel 19 times or something – then if you ask them a question that you genuinely don’t know the answer to, you are genuinely surprised.”He’s a strange mix, John Humphrys. He gets upset if presenters voice opinions, but is quick to give his own. He rues the BBC’s liberal bias, but is a natural liberal himself. He is, I think, a highly emotional man, who decries emotion in reporting. He seeks precise answers but sometimes struggles to articulate accurately what he wants to say. And, though he often falls foul of feminists, he is pro-women.“I detest the word feminism, because of course I’m a feminist,” he says. “God, why does one have to say it? Obviously, obviously… Racism is a profoundly moral issue, as is feminism. That’s why I refused to wear one of those “This is what a feminist looks like” T-shirts. No, it isn’t. This is what a white man looks like, who happens to believe that women are equal to men. I mean, even saying it makes you sound like a dickhead.”You seem to prefer being interviewed by women, I say.“I do,” he says. “Maybe I trust them more. I like talking to women.”Are you more competitive with men?“Yes! Of course. It’s instinctive, I think. It’s not learned. Or it might be. I went to an all-boys school.”Humphrys runs a charity, the Kitchen Tables Charity Trust, which helps feed money to small charities in the developing world, mostly those that work with children. We talk a bit about it, how it works, and about his feelings around the misuse of power and the lack of respect for “ordinary” people. When he was a young journalist, he witnessed the tragedy at Aberfan – he thumps the table when he tells me about it – and saw terrible things, too, when he reported from South Africa.“You see children dying of starvation, and you know, you know it’s because of men who want power,” he says. “Men who want power so much that they will do anything. And it is always the men. With our charity, we don’t give any money to men, ever. Because in our experience, if you give the money to a woman, whether it’s running a little business, or a school, or a charity, it’s used for good reasons. You give it to the man, it’s often pissed against the wall. I would always opt for women because I think they are more – this will get me in trouble with the right-thinking brigade – because I think women are more sensitive to the fear of abuse of childen. The ultimate measure of a society is first, how we deal with children, and second, how we deal with very old people who can’t help themselves. That’s how you judge the humanity of a society and humanity is what it is all about.”Humphrys can’t help himself. He’s thumping the table again, already all riled up.

It isn’t just the getting up at half past three in the morning and having to go to bed at half past eight at night. It’s all the other stuff. You’ve got to read all the newspapers, or try to. You’ve got to keep in touch with everything that’s happening all the time. And that dominates your life. And I’ve had enough of that.Who do you wish you’d interviewed and never got the chance to, and why?I’m not a royalist, but: the Queen. She is unique. I got invited to one of these private lunches – note, private lunches – three others and me, with Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh. And after we’d had the lunch, I did ask her if she would do an interview with me. She likes to take her coffee, not in the dining room, but in the adjoining room so she can throw bits of food to her doggies. I wondered why she said it in such a posh way, but it’s dorgis, she explained to me. Dachshund corgi, join it together, dorgis. Anyway, I asked her for an interview and I went into a big spiel and said, these are the reasons why you could, you know? And she listened to me very patiently and she said: “No… And what’s more, Mr Humphrys, if one were ever to do such an interview, it would certainly not be with you.”Miranda Sawyer: Were you shocked that Johnson didn’t come on when you were on Today?Ha! I retire and within days, he’s on.I would like to know what John Humphrys thinks the UK will gain should we leave the EU.I don’t know. It’s much easier to say what we’ll gain, or at least, keep if we don’t leave the union. But obviously we must, and I speak as somebody who voted to remain.MS: Why do you think people think you voted for Brexit?I’ve no idea! My reasons to vote to remain are many and varied, and largely to do with, you know, no more war in western Europe and being born in 1943, and all that kind of thing. But people who voted to leave were more… passionate is such a ghastly word… more motivated than those who voted remain, because they really did, I think, believe in sovereignty and freedom. Largely, those arguments did not resonate with me. What worries me is that there will be trouble if we don’t leave, unless there is something pretty concrete in its place. Not riots in the street, but if people are told: “You voted, but now you can just fuck off and die,” that’s worrying.What are your feelings about the effect your earning so much more than them had on your female colleagues, particularly Sarah Montague?Sarah was upset and she was right to be upset. Absolutely right. I didn’t know how much she was earning. I have never talked to any other presenter on the Today programme about how much we earn. I think Sarah’s wonderful. But we never had a conversation about our pay.MS: Not even after it had come out?No. I suppose it is odd in a way. But no. I can’t explain it.MS: There’s another part to this question… What are your thoughts on whether you might have volunteered to take a very large pay cut?I did volunteer. Three times. The first time was when I went back on to the staff, because I’d gone freelance in my mid-30s, when the BBC were keen on making you do it. I regretted it because it meant you had to set up a company and all that kind of crap, which I hated. But they made you do it. I’ve still got the bloody memo saying: “If you don’t set up a company we can’t pay you.” I got rid of my private company and became a sole trader because I did not like the idea of not paying tax. And the BBC in the end accepted that I could do that legitimately and they could pay me.MS: Why do you think the BBC wanted journalists to set up as companies?We’re talking about nearly 40 years ago, of course, but I think it was a ruse by the BBC at the time to avoid paying national insurance. Where were we? I’ve forgotten the question.MS: You taking a pay cut…Yes. I’d always thought we should have disclosed our pay, I know I sound like goody two shoes, but it is the case. The important one was when it was announced that presenters’ pay was going to be revealed. I had a chat with James Harding and he said: “There’s going to be a disparity.” And I said: “Well, I’ll cut my pay,” and I think I went down, I don’t know, a hundred grand. A lot, anyway. And that was that. But they’d left it too late and when the pay was announced, though I’d taken a pay cut, my pay was announced as, I think £650,000. And it made me the sixth- or seventh-highest paid. It was Mastermind, and my previous salary. And later, two years after that, I volunteered another cut. I ended up with earning about half what I had been earning. I’m not ashamed of it.MS: But if you aren’t white and you live in a majority white environment, you’re automatically an expert on racism. I mean, just through walking through the world.That’s true. Of course, of course. But you’re not an expert in Donald Trump’s political motives. And that’s… there is a difference there. It’s quite a subtle one, but there is a difference. I think.MS: Do you think the BBC handled the situation badly?Yes. The BBC invariably handles these things badly. It’s because the BBC’s strengths are also its weaknesses. It’s just that the BBC is not didactic. It isn’t an authoritarian organisation. So there cannot be a single clear BBC view. And I think that’s reassuring.Which interviewee surprised you the most, and why?It was an old woman. I went back to South Africa when they had the first Mandela elections. They’d opened the polling booths a day early for old people, people in wheelchairs, pregnant women, so they wouldn’t be crushed to death in the queue. And I went out too and there were massive, massive queues… oh, it was deeply moving. And I looked for somebody who looked like promising material for a live interview. I settled on a very old lady – she looked about 90 – standing next to a young woman, who was very pregnant. I wanted a bit of righteous anger, a bit of: “These bastards, apartheid,” all that kind of thing. And 8.10 came and I did a little introduction and I said to the old lady: “You’re going to be voting soon, what does it mean to you?” And she quietly said: “Mmm, for me, not very much.” And I thought: “Oh, shit.” And then she hesitated for a moment and she leaned across and patted the swollen stomach of the young woman, and she said: “But for the young man in this lady’s stomach, it will mean everything. Because he will be granted the gift of dignity that has been denied to me all my life.” And it was… amazing.Do you feel you ever crossed the line into editorialising, by making contentious statements or challenging interviewees with opinions, particularly in relation to Brexit or climate change?Well, the answer is obviously yes, there’s yet to be a presenter born who hasn’t crossed that line. Also, if you put a contentious view to an interviewee, it doesn’t matter whether you say: “This is the view held by Joe Bloggs,” the audience will hear your voice saying: “There’s no such thing as climate change,” and they’ll think you believe it and will say: “What a wanker he is.” Quite rightly. Except that you haven’t said it, you’ve attributed to somebody else. But yes, sometimes you will get a bit… you go over the top.MS: What about tone? People react so differently to your tone.Well, over the years you establish a relationship with somebody like Heseltine, or John Prescott, or Tony Blair, and you know what to expect and then you have that sort of conversation. That is inevitably going to upset a lot of people who might regard Tony Blair or John Prescott as the spawn of Satan. They will react, because we all hear everything in different ways, don’t we? You are allowed to express controversial views that may not be your own, and I think, for instance, Justin Webb got short-changed over that when he interviewed Nigel Lawson about global warming.MS: People didn’t want Nigel Lawson on at all, because he’s a climate change denier.Quite. I’ve always hated the word denier because it makes it sound like climate change is a religion.MS: The word is used in the same way as Holocaust denier. The Holocaust happened. Climate change is happening.That is true, but there was a very long period of time when we didn’t know that it was happening. The Holocaust has never been, ever, in any doubt, at all.Lots of people probably ask you for advice because of your experience, but what you would say is the most important thing you’ve learned from younger staff members?I know inevitably that I am not going to be “in touch” with young people, in spite of the fact that I have children and grandchildren. Obviously I have a set of prejudices, of attitudes that have developed over the past 76 years. Working with so many young people – and by young, I’m afraid I mean anybody under the age of 30 – it’s like you enter into another world. You always learn something.Is it appropriate to holiday with David Davis and then also to interview him at 8:10 on numerous occasions for a nice cosy chat about Brexit?All those holidays, David Davis and I, they’ve all come as news to me. This is the glory of Twitter. There was a bloke who worked for David Davis for a couple of years, and then had a nervous breakdown of some sort, and appeared on Twitter sounding off about various things, including the “fact” that I had gone on holiday with David Davis. But I’ve had lunch with David Davis twice in the 35 years that I’ve known him, and that’s it.MS: Who do you go on holiday with, John?I don’t go on holiday very often, unfortunately. Ideally with my partner. I’ve never been on a holiday with a politician. I can’t imagine anything worse. In my 33 years on the Today programme, I’ve had lunch with, maybe… half a dozen?MS: Who would they be?One of them was the chancellor after Geoffrey Howe… Norman Lamont. OK, so I’ve had lunch with David Davis. I’ve had lunch with Norman Lamont. I’ve had lunch with, I can’t remember this guy’s name, but he was a very senior figure in Blair’s administration. I had tea in the House of Commons with Gordon Brown. I had a coffee in his office with Tony Blair, in his office in the House of Commons. I think that’s it. No Theresa May, no Maggie Thatcher, no Cameron, none of his lot.MS: What about newspaper proprietors and editors? Do you ever lunch with them?I’ve had lunch with a few. Dacre, at Dacre Towers, as it was all those years ago. Once. People like Charles Moore and… oh, I had dinner once with the last editor of the . What’s his name? Plays the piano.MS: Alan Rusbridger.Yes. I had dinner with Alan Rusbridger. I am not a great socialiser.Do you think you would have had the same success and earning power at the BBC if you’d been a woman?No, not in the early days. It’s difficult. Kate Adie was a little bit older than me and she was far more successful than me in the early days. She’s bloody good. And because she was a woman, and an extremely courageous woman, and brilliant, Kate brought something to her reporting that I would not have been able to bring. The management thing is where the BBC goes wrong. It has been hideously under-managed by women, especially when you consider the women who have worked there – Helen Boaden, for instance, who I wanted to be director general... I’ve been banging on for 15 years about we must have a female director general. No female director general, ever? It’s shocking.Would you encourage any young person to go into journalism today?I wouldn’t be encouraging, no, because it is an immensely competitive field. When my son wanted to be a cellist, he had an audition at the Royal College, and I went in with him to turn the pages of the music. When he finished, the tutor said: “Hmm, I would advise you not to become a professional cellist.” You can imagine my son’s face. And then the tutor said: “Unless doing anything else would make you very unhappy.” That’s corny, but that’s how I feel about journalism.You are happy to promote the Daily Mail. You trust them with the story of your life. Do you observe any political bias in the Daily Mail?This is about the serialisation of my book extracts in the Mail. The deal was done by the publisher.MS: Do you understand why some people don’t like the Daily Mail?I have always read the Daily Mail as a journalist because it speaks to an awful lot of people. Its views may in some cases not be compatible with mine. As the views of the  are sometimes not compatible with mine. People should be able to read views other than their own, or their own views, whichever they choose. They have the choice. And if you’re going to say the Mail is a vicious, pernicious, hideous, biased, prejudiced, cruel, wicked newspaper, then that’s fine. You’re entitled to say that. I don’t happen to believe that its campaigns around plastic or people with dementia or racism – Stephen Lawrence – are exemplary. But to say that the 5 million people who read the Daily Mail are themselves somehow inferior to, let us say, the people who read the  or the Observer… that is grotesque. It is hugely offensive. I mean, I know people who read the Daily Mail whom I like.In his most recent book, the New York Times columnist David Brooks talks about how people scale two mountains in their lives. The main part of their lives is focused on the self – being a success, making a mark – but having reached the pinnacle of the first mountain, they sometimes find it unsatisfying or empty, and realise that there are even bigger things in life that they want to achieve. And so they climb the second mountain, one focused on things that have real value. John, having reached the pinnacle of your first mountain, what second mountain are you planning to climb?I wouldn’t often say this of Jonathan Sacks, who is a deeply thoughtful man, but he’s wrong, the underlying assumption of the question is wrong. I haven’t scaled a mountain. I’ve been successful because I’ve done a job well enough to stay in the job for a long time, and if you stay in any job for long enough, you get respect for the fact that you survived. But I haven’t done anything that I think when… when my children, grandchildren and partner, whoever, stand around my death bed, I’d be able to say: “You see, I did that.” And one’s hope is that one might do something, and it could be something immensely small but important, but I don’t feel I have yet.MS: What are you planning to do that might be that thing?Well, maybe… trees? I’m a guy who has planted a few woodlands in my time, and I would love to find out something about woodlands, about trees, just from observation and talking to lots of people who know, but that’s an interest rather than a mountain to climb.MS: It’s a crucial interest at the moment.But more important than that, I’ve been a very average father. I’ve provided and all that, but I’ve never felt that I’ve been… I’m not massively proud of how I’ve been a father… I’ve excused my personal behaviour, the way that I’ve related to and treated the people who are closest and most important to me. And obviously my children are top of that list.Why are you so suspicious of art?I’m not! You’d have to be a moron to be suspicious of art. When I see a Turner masterpiece or listen to a piece of Bach or read a wonderful book, I am swept away. But I am sceptical about, for instance, found art. I don’t understand how something becomes art because someone important says it’s art. It’s such an interesting conversation but it gets you nowhere. I can’t help feeling that Damien Hirst is not worthy of being in the same room as Turner, but my knowledge is not huge. It’s more heart than head for me, disgracefully, because it’s instinctive.Were you open about your conservative views with your editors when you were presenter on the Today programme? And did they try to compensate in any way?That is such a stupid question. I am not conservative, you know. I am genuinely one of those pathetic people who has very strong views about issues. I think it’s quite difficult to be a hack for as long as I’ve been and come out of that with firm politics. I’m a reporter and my views are informed by what I see and the people I talk to. So every other bloody week I change my mind about something or other, and when you vote, you look for the party that comes closest to what you believe.Why did you insist on wearing the worst headphones in the world?Because, Simon, because when I’m sitting in a studio, I want to hear what the interviewee is saying, and those headphones enable me to do that. But they also let me communicate with the person sitting on my left, and I like to be able to communicate with my fellow presenters, as well as with the outside world. If I was in a studio by myself, then maybe I would have those bloody headphones that make you look like a pensioned-off airline pilot. But – get a life, Mayo!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90eb0e77ed2cb22b92ecf222d2802883c2d1a800/0_87_1003_602/master/1003.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34a765ca7bf0436539448085d91278f6","title":"cocktails culture and craft beer a locals guide to canadas halifax and neighbouring regions","story":"The secret is out. Halifax and its surrounds are a laidback, coastal paradise where postcard perfect seaside towns and vibrant nightlife make for a good time, recommends local Jaime JacquesFoodies take note, a culinary boom is happening in Halifax right now, and the land is linked to everything. Visitors can expect to find ciders made with robust heritage apples, beers infused with locally grown blueberries, and of course, seafood everywhere, including some of the best lobsters to be found on the North American Atlantic coastline. The city is home to seven universities, and it’s got the youthful spirit to prove it. Breweries, cafes, live music and general levity can be found around every corner. Here are a few neighbourhoods and nearby regions that visitors shouldn’t miss to get a true taste of Canada’s most playful port city, a destination that’s only a six-hour flight from the UK.One of the city’s oldest neighbourhoods, the North End has been revived and transformed of late. The streets are an eclectic mix of colourful saltbox houses, old industrial warehouses and hip restaurants serving up craft beer, local wines and creative fare.For a casual afternoon pint in the summer, there’s nowhere better than the patio at Good Robot Brewing Company, where there is a rotating cast of all-star brews on the go and the vibe is always friendly and fun. The small but funky 2 Crows Brewing Co also has 12 taps and a brand new reveal every Saturday. Bar manager Mitch Gilbert recommends the Pollyanna Wild Northeast IPA, a juicy, tropical, bitter IPA that’s been flying off the shelves.“We propagate and grow our own yeast grains,” says Gilbert. “Then we add fruits sourced from Nova Scotia and malt from neighbouring Prince Edward Island. The results yield a quite extensive selection of barrel-aged beers.”For an unforgettable brunch, check out Edna, the bright and airy neighbourhood favourite, full of foraged wildflowers, a wide selection of beers and ciders, and some of the city’s best steaks, burgers and seafood. Later in the day, visit Field Guide – it’s just across the way and the perfect place to start off an evening.

It’s worth a visit, and not only for the view from the top. From there, head downtown, stopping for a stroll in the Public Gardens. Don’t miss the amazing Halifax Central Library, a cultural hub with award-winning architecture and two excellent cafes inside.Head to Argyle Street for a bite or a pint or two after a day of exploring the city. The strip is one of Halifax’s nightlife hubs, where patios line both sides of the pedestrian-only zone.

Heading up the local favourites is the wildly popular Canteen, conveniently located only steps away from the ferry terminal. There’s also the casual Battery Park, offering a slew of craft beers and home to Ace Burger Co, voted the best burgers in Halifax for several years running. For coffee, hit up Two If By Sea, the bright and friendly neighbourhood cafe that’s next door.Visitors to Halifax should also consider a trip to Nova Scotia’s wine country – it’s just an hour from the city. Leading the way is Lightfoot \u0026amp Wolfville Vineyards, a biodynamic, organic winery with strong Acadian roots. Owner Rachel Lightfoot’s family has been farming in the valley for eight generations, creating German-style wines including riesling and pinot noir.“For us, being in tune with the land means being constantly connected to the past and future generations,” she says. Lightfoot recommends trying their bestseller, the Terroir Series Scheurebe. “Nova Scotia’s ocean-influenced cool climate provides freshness and energy, melding with the inherent aromatic intensity of the scheurebe grape to create a truly unique wine,” she says.Another notable favourite is Luckett Vineyards. Pete Luckett is a transplanted Brit who emigrated to Nova Scotia and became a local celebrity. The restaurant is highly recommended, especially the charcuterie board. For beer lovers, Church Brewing Company offers an exceptional collection of craft beers and ciders and locally sourced hearty meals.The area surrounding Tatamagouche boasts several beaches, and because the Trans Canada Trail runs through it, visitors can walk, bike or run their way through town. The village, just under two hours from Halifax by car, is also home to the popular Tatamagouche Brewing Co. The brewery is inside the former village library, bought and reinvented by local craft beer enthusiast Christiane Jost.“The great thing about the beer scene here is that breweries are in every corner of this province,” she says. “We offer world-class beer with unique twists, using local ingredients.”Jost also recommends local restaurants Train Station Inn and the North Shore Diner. “They are both open seasonally, and create fresh food that showcases our local produce,” she says.The idyllic seaside villages of Mahone Bay, Peggy’s Cove, Chester and Old Town Lunenburg, a Unesco world heritage site, make up the south shore, and a scenic coastal drive to visit all four is one of the highlights of a visit to the region. For a self-guided tour, rent a car and enjoy the drive at your leisure, exploring the colourful seaside towns along the way. The area is peppered with local cafes, galleries and boutique shops, perfect for random stops. Over the years, there has also been a surge of creative cuisine along the route, focusing on fresh seafood, seasonal greens and berries, and of course, ciders and beer.Try starting out at The Barn in Mahone Bay or No9 Coffee Bar in Lunenburg for excellent food, coffee and ambience.

Here’s the locals’ guide to British Columbia’s laid-back capitalSet on the southern tip of stunning Vancouver Island, Victoria may be Vancouver’s smaller sibling in terms of size, but what it lacks in big city hustle is more than made up for by its cultural and historical clout, fantastic bar and dining scene, gorgeous natural surrounds , walkability and local charm. And as with any new city to explore, it is the local side of things that you’ll want to get acquainted with on your visit. So, where do Victorians go for the best cocktail, brunch, day trip or cultural fix? Read on to find out …Hot tourist spots such as FanTan Alley, the Parliament buildings and Fisherman’s Wharf are not to be missed from any Victoria trip itinerary, but making time for the smaller attractions is also important – and small is the very essence of the Victoria Bug Zoo, a two-room mini-zoo that will delight (and potentially disgust) visitors of all ages. Housing about 50 species of live tropical bugs to view and experience, the zoo’s friendly and knowledgeable tour guides will have even insectophobes seeing these creepy but fascinating critters in a new light.Speaking of insects, there are sure to be many hanging out at Butchart Gardens.

Today, the gardens are a national historic site,  more than 22 hectares and showcase more than 900 types of plant, as well as a carousel, night illuminations, boat tours, firework displays, and an outdoor ice-skating rink in the winter. Whatever the season, this is one attraction worth adding to the itinerary.

Instead, try and get lost in the more erse and culturally immersive areas in the city, like Kensington Market.’ Lorena Agolli, Sole Survivor ownerMore or less everyone in Toronto can agree that Riverdale and the adjacent neighbourhood of Leslieville are having a moment. While most of this guide features hotspots in the west end, the sweeping views of the skyline and flourishing culinary scene puts this east end spot on the map.Toronto’s appetite for brunch is huge – and its menus reflect the city’s status as one of the most erse in the world, fusing cultures, ingredients and techniques from across the globe. Leslieville knows its way around a brunch better than pretty much anywhere else in Toronto.

At an early workshop exploring the issues, it emerged that all but two of the young performers had been excluded from school. Some are care leavers, some have mental health problems, others have been young offenders. Many have been affected by the consequences of knife crime, which they link to the increasing number of exclusions.“All the people who got locked out of education either got into drugs or into knife crime,” said 18-year-old Ilani Marriott-Lodge, who was herself excluded from classes in year 11 and put in isolation after she dyed her hair blonde.“The rules were so insane.” She was forced to sit her exams on her own, and was then kicked out of college. “I felt like I had let my mum down,” she said.Some said they felt let down by the education system, which failed to listen or understand their needs. “I used to get myself in trouble a lot,” said 19-year-old Rakiya Hasan, who was excluded but fought her way back into education and is now at university. Others she knows have not been so lucky.“Once the system gives up on the student, that student is very, very vulnerable. Seeing it first-hand, people being stabbed and killed, people turning to drugs, it really breaks my heart when I hear some young person has been permanently excluded. It’s a very slim chance someone can come back from exclusion.”Permanent exclusion rates in schools in England are at their highest for nearly a decade at 7,900 in 2017–8, equivalent to around 42 pupils permanently excluded per day. Almost eight out of 10 children who are permanently excluded come from vulnerable backgrounds.The play is being put on by Intermission Youth Theatre (IYT), which uses drama to engage disadvantaged and alienated young people and is supported by patrons Naomie Harris and Mark Rylance. A 10-month drama programme culminates in a four-week run of Excluded, starting on 6 November, at the company’s base at St Saviour’s church in Walton Place.“The cruelty of exclusion happens for many reasons,” said Rylance. “We have young people who are excluded from school, from family, from community, from themselves. Youth who need a mission to integrate themselves in a community by developing trust, expression and creative imagination and hopefully friendship through theatre-making.”It’s a transformative experience for the young people involved. At a Monday night rehearsal, the mood is warm and good-humoured. Everyone is greeted with a hug the performers throw themselves into their roles and enjoy making each other laugh. It feels like a really fun English lesson.The play was written by Intermission’s artistic director Darren Raymond, who fell in love with drama – and Shakespeare in particular – while serving a three-year prison sentence. His previous works include an updated version of Othello set against a backdrop of urban violence. Like his proteges, he felt excluded by school and ended up bunking off to sell drugs.“School is an important chapter that shapes all of our lives,” said Raymond. “With a record number of teachers leaving the profession, the exclusion of the arts in the curriculum and high levels of student exclusions, some would argue that education is in a state of crisis.“It’s dangerous. The consequences are the things we are seeing now – young people out of control on the streets, and prepared to do anything without thinking of the consequences of their actions.”Raymond’s play transports some of Shakespeare’s best known characters into the contemporary classroom. Hamlet’s father has died and his mental health is fragile, which leads to outbursts in class Macbeth meanwhile has been permanently excluded for fighting and gets involved in county lines.“I know people who have been permanently excluded from school and they found themselves down that path,” said 21-year-old Kai Mason. “In 2016 my friend was murdered. He was excluded from school. He didn’t have anything to do.” Mason spent much of year 11 in an isolation booth at school. “It felt like the day went on forever.“I tried my best to be a good kid. I always seemed to end up in a situation where I was in trouble.” When his friend died he was left depressed and suicidal. Now, he’s planning to go to drama school.Marriott-Lodge is also planning a career in acting and already has a number of stage appearances under her belt. “I’m so lucky. The amount of crap, the gang rubbish I’ve been through, I should be dead now.”“I attended two funerals in the beginning of 2019 because of knife crime,” said Hasan. “It was so emotional. It doesn’t have to happen.”She added that if more money was put into projects like Intermission, more lives could be turned around. “In Intermission they look at us as aspiring creatives. They really listen to what we want to do.“Every kid, even those ones that are excluded, they are good kids, but they are misunderstood. At the end of the day, this is the future. You are letting a lot of talent, and a lot of brain, and a lot of ideas go to waste if you let these students go.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f0450b4cfd7dada3fa993fa211e804950f709e5/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a876a6493610937bdc5f8a5899df795f","title":"do you work for a fossil fuel company share your experiences","story":"If you work for a fossil fuel firm, we’d like to hear from you.

James Cartwright meets the fearless female activists behind the yellow pinniesWhile the world applauds the child protesters taking to the streets, fewer eyes are on their mums and grandmothers, whose activism is altogether quieter. In August 2014, gangs of older women in yellow tabards and headscarves started to become a common sight on Preston New Road in Lancashire. They call themselves the “Nanas”, though not all are grandmas. They took the name as a nod to trust, family and tea, leaning into stereotypes of northern matriarchy. Their first project was to capture a field under planning application by Cuadrilla, a UK fossil fuels company seeking exploratory drilling rights for shale gas. They hopped over the fence, set up tents and claimed squatters’ rights, staying for three weeks. By the time they left, the Nanas had earned the support of 14,000 local residents and appointments at Manchester’s High Court, and their action, along with that of other campaigners, led to Lancashire County Council rejecting Cuadrilla’s fracking application, a decision later overturned by the then secretary of state, Sajid Javid.In the years since, the Nanas have mounted an often good-humoured war of attrition against Cuadrilla, whose drilling has caused tremors in the area. At the Bell Mouth, the entrance to the Preston New Road site, they sing, dance, knit, pray, read poems and monologues, and obstruct fracking activity wherever possible. They even have their own stage show and samba band. And every Wednesday, dressed in white, they stage a call for calm at a site where tensions between protesters and police often erupt into violence.In November 2018, Cuadrilla stopped drilling after multiple earth tremors, two of which breached the government’s traffic light system that requires fracking to be paused in the event of seismic activity that exceeds a magnitude of 0.5. Fracking resumed on 15 August 2019, but activity was suspended 11 days later, after the UK’s largest fracking-induced seismic event.Two weeks ago, just a couple of days before the Nanas celebrated 1,000 days of activism at Preston New Road, Cuadrilla announced that it would engage in no further fracking activity on the site before its licence expires at the end of November. The Nanas are now free to enjoy a frack-free Christmas, though they remain on site to make sure.I’ve been an armchair activist for years. I’m a lesbian, and in the early 80s I’d done a bit of Section 28 business and got chased down my own street. But as the years went on I stopped being as active. I’d see things and think, “Huh, isn’t that dreadful?” and hope someone else would do something about it. The earthquakes were the first time I heard about the Preston New Road site, and I lost a lot of sleep. I’d just adopted two small boys and this was happening on my doorstep. Had I not become a mother I probably wouldn’t have looked into it any further. But I wanted to know exactly what was going on. It’s about my kids and their future. I’ve got to protect them.At first I researched both sides, the pros and cons, because you do tend to think that people who are protesting something might be a little extreme, a little bit nuts. And some are. But that’s life. You look at any group of people and there are always a couple of nutters. That’s how the idea of the Nanas came about. A few of us wanted to engage the public without being threatening or aggressive. There’s nothing more gentle and unthreatening than your nana, and if your nana tells you something you listen, because nanas know best. We took the old matriarchal image of Hilda Ogden, put on our yellow tabards and headscarves, armed ourselves with feather dusters and little teapots and went to capture that field at daft o’clock in the morning.There are some moments in your life that stand out, and that’s up there with one of the best of mine. Watching the sun rise after we’d done, I felt as though I was on the right side of history. I no longer cared if the police came and picked me up because I knew I was doing the right thing.I’ve lived in all sorts of countries and at all sorts of income levels. I worked as a journalist in Hong Kong and managed pubs in London. I’ve lived the good life with a maid and membership of the yacht club, and I’ve lived the harder life as a single parent rummaging for change down the back of a sofa. I’d always assumed I was fairly broad-minded, and then I came to activism and realised I wasn’t at all. Finding an army of women of a certain age was the biggest surprise – the realisation that there was this untapped resource. We’re cute, we’re a bit broken, we’re easily damaged – if the cops manhandle us, they’re going to look awful for it.In the early days we made such a difference so quickly. Within months the campaign here grew and we’d built towers at the site and were sleeping in the entrance way, blocking lorries and getting moved at least 10 times a day by the police. That was great, we knew we were having an impact.We’ve been here for more than 960 days now, and everything we’ve done has included humour, but there’s a ball of rage inside me. Every Wednesday, when we do the call for calm, I generally put down the anger and think of it as a fresh start. We started Nana Samba as a kind of anger management for the Nanas. I took a drum and two sticks and I beat the hell out of it and I thought, “I like this!” Then I realised that when I’m drumming I’m harder to arrest. If I’m walking in front of a truck with a drum, you can’t really get a grip on me. I’m getting quite good with the rhythms, too.We get asked what we’d do if it was all over – wouldn’t we miss the comradeship? I don’t have to worry now that we’ve got a samba band. We’re booked through to 2020. We had a gig last week, we’ve got a gig next month. We’ll just pursue our art and keep campaigning to protect our young.My mum’s quite ill and needs help walking. She wanted to come down here to look around and asked me to come with her. At the end of the day she went home and I didn’t. I moved into camp a week later. I’ve been here 14 months now.I’m a photographer, so when I first came down I thought it would be a good project, but very quickly I started leaving my camera at home and taking part in the protest myself. Since then I’ve explored a lot of different areas of activism. I went straight from being an observer to jumping in at the deep end. It’s only recently that I’ve started to explore the gentler side of protest, and that’s why I joined the Nanas.I’ve got two baby sisters and I want to protect the world for them. But I’ve also just worked my arse off for three years finishing my degree. I’d go to college and then come straight here to do a night shift then go back to college the next day. In 12 years, none of that hard work will matter if the world doesn’t exist. I can’t have the future I imagined for myself if all this continues – I can’t think about having a family. There’s no way I’d want to bring more humans into a world that’s about to end.I’ve had talks with some of the security guards at the site and a few of them are against fracking themselves, but they need to feed their families. They don’t want to be there, but they have to do it. We’ve created a system where people can’t risk talking about injustice because they might restrict their freedoms. It’s a real risk.Sometimes it seems like it’s you against the world, but the past few months have felt a lot more hopeful. The youth strikes have been amazing. Everyone’s finding their place with different protests.I found out about fracking in the summer of 2017. I retired from the civil service in January 2018, so I’ve been able to spend a lot of time up here. I was a senior executive officer investigating suicides in prisons. Before that I was a probation officer, and before that I was a police officer. When I was in that job I had to work at the miners’ strikes, so I understand that the police here can’t choose the beat they’re on.But I’ve watched the way they behave and I hate it. I’ve been subject to assault by the police myself. It astounds me that just because I’m standing at the gate protesting a police officer feels they have the right to punch me in the breast. I would never have got away with anything like it while I was in the job.At first I wasn’t sure if I should tell people that I used to be police, but everyone knows now and it has its benefits to some degree. I’m good at helping people out if they get arrested, putting their cases together and getting Freedom of Information Act requests done. I feel like I’m a useful person to have around.Having a Nana name makes you part of the community. Everyone has to agree to their own and it says something particular about you. I got mine when Vivienne Westwood came to visit. She came up specifically to dance to Abba’s Dancing Queen in the Bell Mouth. When she arrived there wasn’t much room for her to dance and she looked a bit lost, so I just put my arm around her and she gave me a kiss.Since I’ve become an activist I’ve done things that I’d never have dreamed of doing before. I’ve joined the samba band, performed in a play and been to protest rallies in London and at the Conservative conference. Activism has given me a different outlook on life, and made me feel much more whole in myself.To be honest, it wasn’t the fracking that initially drew me to this place, it was the community – their honesty and their truthfulness and their resolve. I’ve sympathised with the cause for a long time, and because I’m in the performing arts people would always ask me to come down and choreograph a performance or a song at the gates. It was only when I gave up my job as a programme leader at a local uni that I was able to get more involved.I started to come to the call for calm on Wednesdays and spoke a lot to Becky, Tina’s niece. She was telling me about taking the field in 2014 and I just said, “Stop, can I record you?” We spoke for about 45 minutes, and when I listened back to it I knew I had to do something with it.Now I’ve done 11 interviews and created a piece of theatre called Nanas with Banners. It’s a mix of spoken word, music and dancing. Our next gig is in Sheffield later this month.The main motivation is to communicate that we aren’t typical activists, we’re just mothers and sisters and hairdressers and nurses and whatever else. It’s about normalising us and showing our extraordinary nature. When I first did the readings all the women were in floods of tears.I have a very conservative friend who has no sympathy with what’s going on here, but he came to see the play and afterwards said: “You’ve almost turned me. One day I’ll come down there with you and meet the Nanas.” He hasn’t come yet, but if I’ve done nothing else with these performances then I have at least changed one person’s perspective."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c9119dd13afc4588c496405a27197e42b2fc009/1192_74_2892_1736/master/2892.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb0196d9fd5d4507a2aedc3459e2d8bb","title":"chelsea arsenal womens super league match report","story":"The Chelsea manager, Emma Hayes, was full of praise for the depth and versatility of her team after a thunderbolt from the substitute Maria Thorisdottir earned a precious victory and ended the 11-game winning run of the Women’s Super League champions, Arsenal.“If you get it right you’re an unbelievable manager, if you don’t you’re a pile of shite,” Hayes said with a grin. “I got it right today, that for me is what wisdom is about, you’ve got to get more right than not, more often.”The visiting team took an early lead through Daniëlle van de Donk but Beth England, who scored on her first start for the Lionesses on Tuesday, levelled in style. With Chelsea’s stronger bench undoubtedly the difference, the fresh legs of Ramona Bachmann and Thorisdottir combined to seal the win in front of 4,149 fans.“I said to the players at half-time: ‘I promise you, you score a goal and you watch this house lift,’ and it just went vroom, and I thought there’s only one outcome, 4,000 people in here, we are going to smash it, happy days.”If Chelsea were out for revenge for the 5-0 drubbing Arsenal dealt out at Kingsmeadow almost exactly one year ago, then it showed. The Blues exploded out of the blocks, Fran Kirby looking particularly fresh as they drove into the box from kick-off. The champions needed just nine minutes to open the scoring. Vivianne Miedema, who has scored four of Arsenal’s 18 goals in all competitions this season, danced into the box before slipping the ball to Van de Donk who coolly slotted past Ann-Katrin Berger.It was something of a relief for the Gunners, who looked bright going forward but struggled to contain the pace and slick passing between Kirby, Guro Reiten and the magical Ji So-yun. Chelsea searched for the reply, and Ji was at the heart of every positive attack.Lia Walti, making her first league start as Arsenal ease her back into action following injury, was robbed by Ji in the middle and the South Korean broke into the box, turned round Jen Beattie but lashed her left-footed shot just wide from 20 yards out.After the break Chelsea came out with the bit between their teeth. “I said that we’re going to have to be more aggressive,” said Hayes.“This is a really tricky one because I don’t want to tell you how I did it. Because the manager is then going to read those comments and make sure he doesn’t do it again. But I did something. That’s for you to analyse. That’s your job, not mine.”They pressed with an intensity that forced Arsenal into sloppy mistakes, with more time on the ball for Ji becoming critical. England, who was a little anonymous in the first half, was the first to trouble the Arsenal back line, picking up Ji’s pinpoint cross but firing over. With Arsenal looking a tad shell shocked, it felt inevitable that they would relinquish the lead, and it was England that would capitalise.Beattie was dispossessed in the middle but a hungrier Kirby steamed into the space left by Katie McCabe before squaring to England who, with her back to goal, flicked it up, swivelled and volleyed past Manuela Zinsberger from close range.If Arsenal needed a wake-up call then the goal provided it, but Chelsea continued to press with intent. To add intensity in the middle, Joe Montemurro swapped Lia Walti for the fresh legs of Jordan Nobbs but with their bench options limited and Chelsea throwing on Bachmann and Thorisdottir, the edge stayed with the Blues.With five minutes left to play Bachmann squared to the Norwegian Thorisdottir, who slammed home from 25 yards to send the heaving crowd wild. “Yes,” said Montemurro bluntly when asked whether the score reflected the game. “We were good in the first half but they were better in the second.“We couldn’t keep the ball and our intensity is all ball-based. We were making a lot of fundamental errors which is unlike us and we got punished for it. With the squad that Chelsea have got, with the inidual talent they’ve got, with the size of the squad that they’ve got they should be up there every year. So today is obviously an indication of who they are, they’re a good team, they’re a powerful team.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f622fdcffd7fff25709f7667f38c51e3e5aa078/0_111_5385_3232/master/5385.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13e30e4adcfa98293cbe396974545970","title":"wales v croatia euro 2020 qualifier live","story":"“Please knock off the anti-Welsh stuff,” says David Crouch. “Welsh is not the language of animals.”Are you calling me an animal?Funnily enough I just said exactly the same thing to my dog, Pêl-droed.Italy and Russia have qualified for Euro 2020.

If they win the lot they will be at Euro 2020, although there’s a credible scenario whereby two wins is enough.It’s all pretty complicated, but in essence a draw tonight would be a very good result for Wales, never mind a win, and even defeat would not completely crush the dreams of small children who were too young for Euro 2016 and dream of seeing their side at a major tournament.Although Wales are playing the World Cup finalists, and are without the injured Aaron Ramsey, they will quietly fancy their chances tonight. Their home record under Ryan Giggs is pretty solid, even if the performances haven’t always been convincing, while Croatia’s away form in this group hasn’t been great. They hammered Slovakia 4-0, sure, bring that up if you must, but they also lost in Hungary and drew in Azerbaijan.Those results mean they can’t take anything for granted in this group. A win tonight would ensure qualification for Euro 2020 a defeat would leave them vulnerable to a potential sting when they host Slovakia in their final game. Kick off is at 7.45pm.

But for some Instagrammers it’s also now a job. Amelia Tait meets the influencers making a career out of blogging about Disney food, Disney fashion and Disney funWhen she was living in New York City, AJ Wolfe would read guidebooks about Walt Disney World on her way to work. Wolfe used the books to “escape from real life” on her commute. Fifteen years later, she makes a living doing a job that didn’t even exist then, and many can hardly believe exists now – eating sweets at the Most Magical Place on Earth.Since 2009, Wolfe, a mother of one from Texas, has posted pictures and food reviews of Disney food online at her Disney Food Blog, which has evolved into a wildly successful website, video channel and Instagram page. She has accumulated more than 82m views on YouTube and has more than 530,000 followers on Instagram. Like most content creators, Wolfe earns money by selling adverts and taking sponsorships directly from brands. She can hardly believe it. “It’s… incredible,” she says. Wolfe, 41, travels to Disney World once a month. On those days, she gets up at 6am, visits the park, tastes and takes pictures of the food and works until 2am editing content. “It’s an unsustainable way of living if you’re there every day,” she says, “but if you’re only there for a few days…”A decade ago, Wolfe relied on credit cards to pay for her frequent Disney trips. Now, she’s essentially paid to go. “I like to say Disney World is the opposite of New York: perfectly manicured, cultivated happiness versus the gritty reality of the city that never sleeps,” she explains. “I think that’s why Disney approaches ‘obsessive’ levels for some people. It’s such a marked escape from the worries and stresses of their real, day-to-day life.” For years, “Disney was an absolute obsession for me,” she says. Now it’s her career.Wolfe is one of hundreds of people who make a living posting Disney content online, and one of many millions who enjoy consuming it. Though usually not officially affiliated with the brand itself, people who photograph themselves in Disney parks have collectively earned a small fortune by posting about the mouse.We’re familiar with the concept of Instagram influencers – people who live polished and perfect lives that we love (and hate) to follow. But in a world oversaturated with #beauty and #bikini shots, niche influencers are on the rise, too. There are influencers who only post about Harry Potter – dressing up as characters and attempting to cook foods mentioned in the books – and influencers obsessed with Poundland, who show off their weekly bargains. There are vegan influencers, Christian influencers, dog influencers, kidfluencers. “You surround yourself with your tribe,” Wolfe theorises of the trend. “Disney is a happy place, a getaway, so it makes sense that you want to e into it. When I’m not in Disney World, I do the same thing. I think everyone wants to get a little taste of vacation life.”Over the past few years, marketing agencies have begun to understand the benefits of “micro influencers”. Typically, they have fewer followers than the traditionally internet famous, but small-time influencers are valuable because their followers are often more loyal and thus more likely to purchase recommended products. In an age of increasing distrust towards influencers, marketers feel micro influencers who command the attention of a close-knit group will provide a better return on investment.Chelsea Watson is a Disney Instagrammer (@StyledByMagic 65,000 followers) whose grid is bursting with bright colours and classic influencer shots. She twirls her skirts, pouts her lips and strikes over-the-shoulder poses. The key difference between Watson, 24, and other famous Instagrammers – the model Kylie Jenner, for example, or Britain’s girl-next-door Zoella – is the mouse ears atop Watson’s head. “I know my family don’t always fully understand how it works,” Watson says, of her influencing career.In 2017, she and her husband moved to Florida from New Hampshire so Watson could pursue a Disney career full-time and she now visits the parks “at least twice a week”. Her posts are dedicated to Disney-inspired fashion and accessories. She creates roughly three sponsored posts a month brands pay her to advertise their products in a picture. Though she won’t talk exact figures, this is now her sole income. “In a sense, I’m just like any other fashion blogger,” she says. “The dream is to always do something you love.”Watson has a passion for fashion. But she also has a passion for Disney. When we speak over Skype, her hair is half-up-half-down in a big scrunchie, and she is wearing a Dumbo T-shirt in which the cartoon elephant’s ears are tied into a cute little knot. “Disney was such a formidable part of my generation’s upbringing. We consumed so much as we were growing up that it made a lasting impact.”In a remarkably prescient essay from 1992, NYU professor David Forgacs wrote that anyone born after 1925 is a “Disney baby”, brought up on a diet of films, stories and merchandise dictated by the mouse. “Disney babies grow, ideally, into Disney adults,” he wrote, arguing that Disney adults have Disney babies of their own. Forgacs spoke of the way the parks marketed nostalgia and played with the boundaries between adolescent and child, in order to profit. “Children are a major source of Disney income, but only indirectly: it is adults who spend money on them,” he reminds us. This summer, a New York Post writer declared: “Sorry, childless millennials going to Disney World is weird,” after a mother’s Facebook rant went viral: “People without children need to be banned!!!!” But Watson and Wolfe say their audiences are erse. They are followed by families, elderly couples and childless millennials. “I’m always taken aback by the mix of people,” Watson says. Why does she think people find her content so compelling? “I think it has a lot to do with the climate in general,” she says. “In today’s world, people want something happy and positive to focus on. Disney really is for everyone. It’s not just for kids.” She argues that Disney influencers give people “a place to come together and talk about things they love. Be happy. Get away from the negativity for a while.”No one in Watson’s personal life has criticised her for being a grown adult who loves Disney, but other Disney influencers haven’t been so lucky. Britt and Jared are a married couple from Louisiana who have 32,000 followers on their Disney Instagram and YouTube profiles combined. They both still work full time (Jared as a pharmacist, Britt as a hairstylist), though Britt has doubled her income by selling homemade Mickey Mouse ears on Instagram.They are watching 1999’s Tarzan just before I Skype them and they tell me about a Mickey Mouse scarecrow outside their house for the autumn season.“Do you ever get judged by people?” I ask. “Oh my God,” Britt exclaims. Jared offers a prolonged laugh punctuated with a simple, “Yeah!” A few years ago, when Britt worked in a bank, she saw her colleague was swamped with work and offered to help. “Don’t you have a colouring book to colour?” her colleague had retorted. “That’s the rudest thing anybody has ever said to me,” says Britt. “Just because I like Disney doesn’t make me immature. It makes me way more open-minded and broad, that I could find magic in places that you’re struggling to find magic in.”Magic isn’t the only thing the couple find at Disney World. Britt says they were “broke as a joke” before she began selling her ears. Now, if the couple have a big bill or need money quickly, she can open up her ear shop and instantly sell 40-50 pairs, which she will make in the course of a month. But the couple say they’re not just motivated by money, they enjoy the opportunity – through the Disney vlogs they post every Monday – to share the parks with those who can’t afford to visit them in real life.“We’ve had people message us from all over the world saying they were suicidal and our videos helped them through the darkest parts of their lives,” Britt says. “It’s helped them through sicknesses. It’s helped them through family feuds. It’s helped them through their own depression, their own fights. It’s amazing that us going on vacation is helping someone else.”Once, in the Magic Kingdom, the couple saw a Colombian woman standing alone, crying as she looked at ornaments in the year-round Christmas shop. She told them she was a cancer survivor and that her family had pooled all their money to send her to Disney World, but couldn’t afford for anyone else to accompany her. “It was almost like an out-of-body experience,” says Britt. “I looked around… I can literally wake up any day and get on a plane and go to Disney World. I have a career out of going to this place I’ve made friends. It put into perspective how grateful we are to be able to do what we do.”They also enjoy Disney parks because they feel secure there. “We don’t ever have to worry about not feeling safe. The world is really scary now,” says Jared. When Britt goes to Disney, she is happy in the knowledge that everyone else is visiting for the same reason she is. “When you go to a place like New York City, you don’t know what the person standing next to you is there for.”A reputation for being the happiest place on Earth means Disneyland has always been profitable, but it’s undoubtable the company benefits from the influencer trend. Since 2018, Disneyland Paris has run an influencer programme called InsidEARS, giving a select number of influencers early access to information in the hope they’ll promote the parks to a millennial audience, often Dinks (dual income, no kids) who have cash to spare.Steph and Dave, 34 and 32, are InsidEARS from Eastbourne. They have 30,000 YouTube subscribers and 14,000 Instagram followers. When they Skype me from their home office, they are sitting in front of a copy of the “Purple Wall” in Disney’s Magic Kingdom park. Above the fireplace in their living room is a painting of Mufasa and Simba from The Lion King. “We have to create some story when we have an electrician come into the house,” laughs Steph. “But when people comment online and say, ‘You brighten my day up,’ that’s the best thing ever.”Steph and Dave’s viewers are mostly aged between 25-35. “A lot of people think Disney is a kids’ thing,” says Dave. “I’m going to keep this going until I’m old and wrinkly, and still going to the parks.” Do Disney influencers ever get sick of Disney? None of the influencers I speak to can comprehend the idea of being sick of Disney. Their biggest fear is that their career will somehow dampen their love of the brand. “I don’t ever want to get in the mindset that it’s always work for me,” says Chelsea Watson. “I don’t ever want to lose that sense of magic.”Believe it or not, Disney influencing can be difficult – a job is, after all, a job. There’s a pressure to always be online, multiple outfit changes in the park, long days, and the ever-increasing expectations of fans. Still, as far as opportunities to earn money go, it seems you can hardly beat reviewing a Mickey-shaped ice-cream, or showing off your latest Disney products haul.“We just get out there and enjoy ourselves,” says Dave. He says the couple often film themselves “giddy as kids” at the airport before arriving at the parks, and that this is some of their most popular content. “People share the same feelings we do,” he says, “so that must be the reason it does so well.”In essence, these influencers allow viewers all the escapism of a Disney holiday without the price tag. “When you go to Disney World, you forget that the world has become so dark outside,” says Britt, in Louisiana. Food blogger Wolfe concurs: “When you’re at Disney World, you’re able to escape your stresses. And it’s wonderful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0ce0e5136d9fd14b6e235b6d0a562e2e81700b2/0_207_5692_3415/master/5692.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bf9adf1bc4a7a2f80523993cbdb62e4","title":"are pets really good for us or just hairy health hazards","story":"Many animal-lovers think a cat or dog can help you live a longer, happier, healthier life. But does the science back them up?My childhood dog was called Biff. Biff was a handful. He was a loud, cocky shetland sheepdog who oozed bravado and bravery. Yet, underneath it all, he struggled with the dog version of impostor syndrome. Biff was a bag of masked insecurity. He was like the kid in school who says he has seen all the scary movies, but refuses to go to any sleepovers where scary movies are played the kid who has “a girlfriend at another school”. It was that fragile side I especially loved about Biff during my teenage years. We shared an insecurity that neither of us had the cognitive skills to put into words. This was a friendship – one that lasted as he grew older, grumpier and more infirm.He was an exceptionally licky dog, and loved nothing more than slurping his tongue over our jeans, shoes, socks and coats. Officially, this behaviour was something we attempted to quash – but, every few nights, I would tiptoe into the kitchen and allow him to lick my naked hands and wrists to his heart’s content. For me, the sensation was tickly and calming, and never once disgusting, even though those around me told me it was not a good idea, mainly because it was highly likely that, on any given day, Biff had stuck his snout into some poor fox’s rotting cadaver. I didn’t care. I washed my hands like a surgeon afterwards, obviously. But it was what Biff wanted.I haven’t had a dog since Biff (I’m nearly 40), and my family and I are deciding whether it’s time to get our own dog. This feels like a very big decision. Part of the reason we want a dog is that we want to walk more. We want to be healthier. We want to be happier. But questions flutter anxiously in the pit of my stomach. Will having a pet really make us happier? Will we be healthier? Does having a pet always make us better people?The good news, at face value, is this: if you are looking for proof that having a pet improves your general health, the evidence abounds. For instance, there is plenty about how a bout of pet-stroking can lower your heart rate (and the pet’s), easing your body into a less stressed condition. This seems to apply across the spectrum, from dogs and cats to snakes and goats. And there’s more. There’s evidence from Germany and Australia (sample size: 10,000) that pet-owners make fewer visits to the doctor and, from China, that pet-owners sleep more soundly than those who aren’t. Just last week, the American Heart Association reported that the survival prospects for people who have had heart attacks and strokes are better in dog-owners than in those who are not.You could also argue that pet ownership helps us to feel better about ourselves. A loving owner can give an animal a far better life than it otherwise would have had: always-friendly faces, constant compassion, cuddles and hands to lick late at night – not just to help pathogenic resistance but just because it makes both parties happier, warmer and more contented residents of planet Earth. That was what Biff and I had. Two species, both with equal rights to the same shared, loving home. Connection.This stuff is hard to measure, but research has shown that dogs and cats see a spike in their levels of the “love molecule” oxytocin when interacting with their owners. If they feel so much affection for us, we must be doing something right.So far so good: it really does seem there’s some truth to the claim that pets are good for us. But closer inspection reveals some problematic and murkier truths.As many academics have pointed out, other factors contribute to our general health – income, for instance, which is inherently linked to pet ownership because pets cost money. Bluntly, the truth behind some of these studies may simply be that those with more money can, on the whole, afford the luxuries of good health and pet ownership. One large-scale study in California involving 5,200 families failed to find a relationship between owning a pet and overall health after correcting for income and the affluency of the local neighbourhood. Other studies have had similar results. And some even suggest pets are bad for us. One study of 21,000 people in Finland, for instance, suggested that pet owners are more, not less, likely to have higher blood pressure and cholesterol levels.If you really want to go there, there are some pretty alarming downsides to pet ownership. In England, for instance, between 6,000 and 7,000 people are admitted to hospital for dog bites each year. Tripping over pets is another potential danger – each year, this sends an estimated 87,000 people to hospitals in the US, particularly elderly people. And what of the parasites that pets bring into the house – the fleas, ticks and mites? And the potentially fatal diseases they can transmit to humans, from pathogens such as salmonella (from reptiles) and capnocytophaga that can be passed to humans in cat and dog saliva? For many people, the answer to whether pets are good for us is clearly no – although, to be fair, you are far more likely to be exposed to disease or violence by another human than by a dog, cat or pygmy hedgehog.There are emotional downsides, too. One of the often forgotten aspects of pet ownership is having to care for animals into their old age, sometimes dealing with diseases that last months or years. Assuming you are a responsible pet owner, who takes this as seriously as you would caring for a human family member, this is a heavy emotional burden. A 2017 study involving 238 human participants found that pet owners with chronically ill pets had higher levels of stress and anxiety, coupled with a lower quality of life. And after death? My guess is that a family grieving for their recently dead cat is not going to appear in an advert for Pets at Home any time soon.If we were able to put all these pros and cons into a melting pot and come up with a definitive answer to the question of whether or not pets are good for us, what would the answer be? The answer would be … complicated. Because humans and our circumstances are so universally mixed up and complex. The simple truth is that having a pet has good and bad sides, and it may not be for everyone. Which means we have a duty to think carefully before acquiring one. We need to imagine the good times we might have with a pet and to consider the bad times, too: the insecurity, the grumpiness in old age, the infirmity.I think I have talked my way out of having a dog. If so, that’s OK. Loving animals doesn’t mean you have to have one. Ask not what a pet can do for you, but what you can do for a pet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93d83f876741f2353666808024a96739bbdae84d/338_898_7344_4406/master/7344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb2bab063c3d4e4afb3b62bb45b807e4","title":"how do you make the perfect cup of tea","story":"The key to a good cup of tea is high-quality ingredients. For the tea itself, use leaves rather than bags, as the pieces are larger and give more flavour. While bags give the water a burst of colour and provide a quick brew, the flavour is duller. Using leaves doesn’t mean you have to use a pot: you can get great infuser baskets that allow you to make just one cup.As for the water, if you live in an area where it is hard, invest in a filter. Hard water has a higher mineral content and is the reason for the oily scum you see sometimes on the surface of tea. For black teas, the water should be boiling as it hits the leaves, so heat your crockery with a little hot water beforehand. With green teas, you want the water a little cooler – about 70C to 80C.The amount of milk you add is a personal preference, but strong black teas such as breakfast tea should be drunk with milk, as they are blended to be taken that way. Milk should be added only once the tea is ready.Sugar should be added to chai tea only, but it is important to remember that tea is about enjoyment – it is a question of what you like more than anything else.Angela Pryce, a tea sommelier, was talking to Anna Michaux"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26c3d000edf7bfa90ccffd431ef0c0656437e454/0_290_4776_2866/master/4776.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdd5d4bee62fd913ce20eaf7684b1618","title":"my family is split over brexit now we want to move abroad mariella frostrup","story":"Explain your choices to your parents and don’t tell them they were wrong to vote Leave, says Mariella Frostrup. No matter what happens we all, Remainers and Brexiters, have to learn to live harmoniouslyThe dilemma We’ve had a child since the referendum, and I feel a Brexit-related chasm is opening up between our family’s generations. My husband and I are moderate in our political views and both voted to remain in the EU. My parents and mother-in-law voted to leave. I look at my daughter and feel devastated that her world is potentially going to be smaller than mine, with fewer opportunities to live, love and work as she pleases. Our own parents are dependent upon us for varying levels of care. This has been mildly frustrating in the past, but we both have loving families and a strong sense of duty. We’ve talked about leaving the UK for a more open and inclusive society, but don’t want to leave our parents dependent on paid-for care. Whichever option we explore, we’re increasingly resentful our parents voted for us to be in this position (based on various arguments, some with racist undertones), and that they don’t even recognise the situation. Should we raise it with them? I fear a permanent rift, but brewing resentment doesn’t feel healthy either.Mariella replies Talk about the nation’s debate in a microcosm! It was only a matter of time before this toxic political fracas, currently iding us like the most bitter of orces, came to haunt lifestyle pages as well as the headlines. So many families and friendships have been torn asunder by the passion disgorged on both sides, with the only comfort being that it’s a long while since people engaged with politics with such ferocity.Brexit has unleashed a tsunami of frustration and fear and, as you point out, the generational ide is part of the fracture. What chance do you think you have of changing your parents’ minds? That seems to me to be the crux of this impasse. Those of us holding out for a second referendum do so with scant belief that the voting percentages would change dramatically. What seems to have occurred since that fateful June morning, when our children lost their right to roam among their closest neighbours, is greater entrenchment and growing resentment on both sides.I’m the first to admit that remain’s argument was lacklustre, out-of-touch and ultimately patronising. Their “better together” principle may have been right, but the delivery was badly flawed. It was like a complacent spouse explaining that while they might be dreary, the alternative would be a roller-coaster ride of uncertainty. Clearly, plenty are up for that ride! Far more compelling rationale has flowed from the likes of Ken Clarke and Michael Heseltine, whose broader view of history and statesmanlike declarations about co-operation and democracy might have carried the crowd.On the opposite side are those who were sold the Brexit dream by a bunch of desperados who make secondhand car salesmen look like paragons of truth and virtue. Those torch bearers are like the serial adulterer – no matter how many times they are exposed as having deceived us, they plead their commitment and promise tomorrow will be different. The one imperative to have been swept from the table is what kickstarted the debacle in the beginning – the need for EU reform. Reform not just to ensure member states don’t end up in a bitter battle like ours, but to shape a cumbersome governing body for a fast-moving, globalising world.I’ve not witnessed political chaos on this level since the early 80s when strike action, union fury and the Iron Lady combined to create a social revolution of seismic strength that in many ways set the scene for the strife today.Where does your little family fracas fit in all this? Right in the epicentre, I’d say. No matter what happens we are all, Remainers and Brexiters, going to have to learn to harmoniously co-habit on our small island with understanding, patience, empathy and reduced hyperbole. At the moment, like you, we’re all waiting to see what the outcome will be but actually, the time to start mending fences is now.Your parents have made a choice that may or may not influence where you choose to raise your children. It doesn’t mean you have to fall out just that their choice has had an impact on yours. So, I wouldn’t try to change their minds or convince them they’ve got it wrong. Instead, illustrate to them that many of their fears – whether of marauding migrants or lack of self-determination – are unjustified. Be honest, but without acrimony when you explain the decisions you’ve made, bearing in mind their wellbeing and with your child’s future at the forefront of your mind.The only non-negotiable in this whole debacle is that we can’t compromise on our determination to carve a better future. In or out, we owe it to ourselves to ensure that we become again a nation we can be proud to inhabit for its values of inclusion, intelligent debate, democracy and basic human and equal rights. That’s plenty to be getting on with.

So I guess we can forgive James Forsyth, the Spectator’s political editor, for his hyperbolic claim last week that he had been the recipient of “the most explosive Downing Street memo in modern times”.In fairness, it was hugely interesting, and not just for its content. It was a rare example of a supposedly confidential source being cavalier about his own identity. Step forward Dominic Cummings, special adviser to Boris Johnson. Allegedly? No, for sure.Eventually, despite a measure of initial reticence, several newspapers felt confident enough to name him.This episode was further proof that Brexit is changing Britain’s political and journalistic culture. It certainly merits the description as the most explosive political event since … well, since any living politician and living political journalist can remember. Quite simply, there has been nothing like it in the collective experience of Westminster and Fleet Street.Let’s deal first with the significance of the memo’s eye-popping content.Cummings was detailing the government’s game plan should it be necessary to extend the Brexit deadline still further. In that event, to quote the  columnist Gaby Hinsliff, No 10 was, in effect, “threatening almighty vengeance”.Aside from providing a delighted Forsyth with an intimate view of the state of the negotiations, it not only revealed No 10’s strategy but also its frustration over the failure to achieve its primary objective to take the UK out of the EU on 31 October.Then came the pushback, the threat of a drama to come. Cummings wrote of “legal advice” that means “we can do all sorts of things to scupper delay which for obvious reasons we aren’t going into details about”.We must presume Cummings’s “leak” was intended as a message to MPs from all parties and, possibly, Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, along with EU leaders in Brussels. But what was striking was his flagrancy. It was as if he wanted to be recognised as the author. Here was a man, blandly described in time-honoured fashion by Forsyth as “a contact in No 10”, virtually outing himself as the source.This was so unusual that, in spite of political journalists knowing his identity, several felt constrained from saying so. Instead, their reports referred to him with the usual range of indirect terms: “a No 10 source” (the Times and ) “a senior government source” (Daily Mail) and “aides” (the Sun, pluralising an inidual).Others were less inhibited. The Daily  referred to “a memo widely believed to be a text sent by Dominic Cummings”.  was a little more guarded. It reported that Julian Smith, the Northern Ireland secretary, had “issued a rebuke to the person who briefed anonymously to the Spectator, believed to be the prime minister’s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings”.Simon Walters, in the Mail, did not hold back. He wrote: “The Downing Street ‘source’ quoted by the Spectator bore the unmistakably contemptuous and crude tone of Johnson’s de facto chief of staff Dominic Cummings.” While that sentence could be said to reflect Walters’s personal animosity towards Cummings, I tend to think it speaks volumes about the changing political viewpoint of the Mail itself. There’s a story in the making.Back to Cummings. Whatever one thinks of him, there is something wonderfully refreshing about his way of going about his business. His memo to Forsyth is part of a pattern. He has not concealed his fingerprints on a number of previous leaks from No 10, especially in the lead-up to the supreme court ruling against the prorogation of parliament.Not for Cummings the usual backroom role of an adviser. No smoke and mirrors for him. He is a very public eminence grise who enjoys the limelight and, apparently, revels in the consequent notoriety. He appears determined to be his own man rather than be part of someone else’s story.Whether or not this is bad for the country – we shall see – it cannot be denied it’s rather good for our trade. We thrive on colourful characters courting controversy. Journalism is often the beneficiary of big egos in the sense that, in promoting themselves, they inevitably provide stories. One problem for Cummings is how he deals with journalists in the coming weeks. Can he hope to brief on an entirely confidential basis? With this and other lengthy examples of his writing style in the public domain, it’s impossible to conceal his authorship. Then again, he obviously doesn’t want to be anonymous.It is unlikely that the Cummings way will lead to a change in how political journalists obtain their information. Down the years there has often been criticism about the cosiness of the lobby system and the opacity of Westminster and Whitehall sources. But it’s a necessity. Off-the-record conversations allow information to reach the public domain that would otherwise remain secret.Nor, as some critics believe, is it a system widely open to abuse. Reporters working in a competitive media environment police each other by checking on the truth of an opponent’s story. Indeed, when scoops occur, one of the more unedifying practices is the hunt for the source by rivals. Although one’s own confidential sources must be respected, other people’s are not.Most of the time, the system of unattributable briefings is uncontroversial and, in such circumstances, single sourcing is also accepted as the norm. No one can conceive of doing it differently. Even in the US, where a culture of openness contrasts with Britain’s more secretive climate, journalists rely on “deep background” to flesh out their stories. Politics thrives on concealment of some kind.So, in spite of the darkness of his message, let me applaud Cummings, the messenger who has stepped out of the shadows. We may not have him for long, of course, but let’s enjoy him while we can.

But this weekend, at Sandford holiday park in Poole, an uprising of women in music took place with Hear Her festival, an all-female line-up of artists from across a spectrum of folk, pop and indie rock.Backed by Diva magazine, the event was co-curated by musician KT Tunstall and headlined by Manchester synth-disco artist Shura and Mercury-nominated Northern Irish singer-songwriter Soak. As well as featuring only female-identifying acts, Hear Her was entirely curated and managed by women (and had female trainee sound engineers from the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts learning the ropes on the sound desk).Actress, musician, and Diva music editor Heather Peace founded Hear Her in 2018 as a response to what she saw as a lack of platforms for emerging female artists. “The festival line-up balance, it’s appalling,” she said.The fact that this shift is happening, in her opinion, is even more reason to have a boutique all-female event like Hear Her – because bigger festivals are now “actively looking for female artists”.Emily Eavis was recently quoted as saying that whilst she would love to book women in the top slots at Glastonbury, “the pool isn’t big enough … Everyone’s hungry for women, but they’re just not there.”Northern Irish artist Soak, who played her first headline festival slot for Hear Her this weekend, disagrees that there aren’t women available to fill those main stage spots. “I would argue that there are those people, but they’re not being given … the good slots at festivals in order to build their fanbase and their stagecraft. There’s definitely not enough nurturing being put into women.Margate-based synth-pop artist Lanta, who also played on Saturday at Hear Her, agrees. “We have to really recognise that the reason why female-led bands and artists aren’t being perceived as doing well enough is that they have to be let through by the gatekeepers,” she says. “I don’t think there’s one solution to such a complex situation. I do think accountability has to rest a bit with festivals. Because I’ve discovered so many amazing bands at festivals.”Peace has no ambitions to make Hear Her bigger than its current capacity of under 1,000 people “I like the small, safe space feel. There’s a real feeling of kindness in the room.” But she does hope that it can create a ripple effect that goes beyond Sandford. “I just want Hear Her to become a space where the bigger festivals might look at what we’re promoting, and take them to the next level.”Among the predominantly female and LGBTQ crowd, that kindness was palpable at the weekend. “It’s been really lovely,” said 31-year-old Mo, a festival attendee from Edinburgh. “There’s not enough spaces that are focused on women in music and inclusive. I miss lesbian nights and queer, women-focused events – there’s been a bit of a dearth of that.”In the future, when line-ups generally are more balanced, Peace says she would love to welcome men to play at Hear Her festival, too. For now, the all-female line-up is a necessary tool for change.“It’s interesting that an all-female bill is such a novelty,” says Soak. “It should just be like, ‘Oh, cool.’ I hope more of it happens and it shows just how well you can pull off a festival with all-female line-ups.

Hostile briefings flowed out of Downing Street, enraging EU officials. Both sides now admit an agreement before the European council summit next week is unlikely. At the heart of all of this, one issue has remained unresolved: the Irish border. If the UK is determined to leave the EU single market and customs union, how does it comply with the Good Friday agreement and the necessity of an open border with the Republic of Ireland?  Joining Anushka Asthana to discuss it all are the ’s Brexit correspondent Lisa O’Carroll and Ireland correspondent Rory Carroll.

The 25-year-old Kenyan ran 2:14:04 to beat Radcliffe’s best of 2:15:25 by an astonishing 81 seconds.The whispers all week in Chicago had been that Kosgei was intending to make a serious assault on Radcliffe’s time. In cold and sunny conditions – perfect for the marathon – she knew the attempt was on, especially when the winds died down on Sunday morning.Kosgei immediately set out her stall by going through five miles in 25:10, way inside world record pace. Some feared that she had massively overcooked her pace and would eventually boil over. But even though Kosgei slowed her pace she still went through halfway in 66.59, over a minute faster than Radcliffe’s time in setting her world record in 2003.There appeared to be a moment where Kosgei did not seem to be quite as comfortable, but when she ran the five kilometers between 25 and 30 km in 15:45 pace it was clear that she the record was in her grasp. And so it proved.Afterwards an elated Kosgei admitted she was surprised to run so fast. “I am feeling good, and I am happy because I was not expecting this,” she said. “But I felt my body was moving, moving, moving so I went for it.”Meanwhile Radcliffe, who posed for photographs with the Kenyan afterwards, admitted it was a bittersweet moment. “If you had told me when I set it in 2003, that it would last that long I wouldn’t have believed it,” she said. “But I always knew this time would come - and when I saw how fast Brigid was running today I knew the record would go if she could maintain her pace.”If there is one question mark over Kosgei’s thundering achievement it is that her agent, Federico Rosa, has had a high number of athletes who have been banned. They include Asbel Kiprop, the former world 1500m champion, Jemima Sumgong, the 2016 London marathon and Olympic champion, and Rita Jeptoo, who won this race in 2013. However there is no suggestion of wrongoing by Kosgei or Rosa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e20a32d965ef987dc16c32ad5b0d8c9f0d3e150/0_190_4729_2838/master/4729.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bed9dc509e92ce3e7865eb8f9a4421ac","title":"formula one japanese grand prix valtteri bottas mercedes constructors championship","story":"Such is Lewis Hamilton’s determination to win that even as his Mercedes team made history, frustration initially coloured the crowning moment. The world champion has been at the heart of their success and, as always, he had wanted to be at its head when Mercedes indelibly made their mark on Formula One at the Japanese Grand Prix.There was disappointment in the aftermath of his third place at Suzuka but ultimately Hamilton took huge satisfaction in helping secure Mercedes’ place in the annals of F1. With teammate Valtteri Bottas taking the win, the two have ensured Mercedes clinched their sixth consecutive constructors’ title and that they will be the first team to take six consecutive drivers’ and constructors’ doubles.Formula One has had periods of team dominance but the achievement of Mercedes is unprecedented. The sixth team title matches that of Ferrari between 1999 and 2004 but – with Hamilton and Bottas extending their lead such that only they can win the drivers’ championship – a record‑breaking sixth double belongs to Mercedes.Bottas has just kept his championship hopes alive but Hamilton remains on course to take a sixth of his own. His frustration with the team’s strategy swiftly turned to celebration and honour as he dedicated the title to Niki Lauda, Mercedes non-executive director who died in May this year.“I think the whole team and the whole of Mercedes will probably dedicate this to Niki,” he said. “It has been a difficult, a tough year for us. Every time I walk into the garage I see Niki’s headphones and his cap. I know he’ll be proud, I know his family will be as well. The team should be proud too.”The British driver leads Bottas by 64 points: 104 remain and he will take the championship if he is 78 in front after the Mexican Grand Prix. Bottas’s win was a controlled and impressive drive but it is Hamilton, with nine victories, who has done the damage this season and the vast majority of the previous five. He has taken four titles since 2014, when Mercedes emerged as pre-eminent in a formula defined by its engine as the turbo-hybrid era.With nine wins from 16 races Hamilton has shown a relentless will to win that lies behind his disappointment in Suzuka. He felt that Mercedes were left wanting with his strategy but had been on the back foot after qualifying which took place four hours earlier having been postponed because of typhoon Hagibis.Ferrari showed exceptional pace over the single lap. Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc locked out the front row, with Bottas third and Hamilton fourth. Indeed had both the Ferrari drivers not once more made mistakes, Mercedes would surely have been denied their celebrations for now at least.The start and opening corner, as is often the case at Suzuka, proved crucial. Bottas made a blistering start to take the lead, while Vettel only crept away having moved before the lights went out but then checked the car. The German was investigated for a jump start, no action was taken but the damage was done. Leclerc in turn, drifted wide while understeering through turn one and hit a charging Max Verstappen. The Ferrari driver took wing damage and was forced to pit for a replacement. Verstappen, who had been blameless, had to retire because of the damage and Leclerc took 15sec of penalties relegating him to seventh.With Bottas leading, Mercedes opted to pit him twice and try Hamilton on a single stop. But while it worked perfectly for the Finn, Hamilton’s chances unravelled. He lost too much time going long on his first stint and then the team switched to a two-stop, after having had him push his tyres too hard. A late surge on new rubber was not enough to pass Vettel, who held second, while the world champion bewailed the wrong options over team radio. “We’ll go and sit and talk to the engineers and strategists,” he said. “I think today could have been done better.”The team principal, Toto Wolff, admitted it had been a 50-50 call in opting not to stick to the one-stop and understood the world champion’s dissent. “Every driver is keen to maximise every opportunity to win and when that doesn’t happen it is frustrating,” he said.Yet for all that Hamilton wanted more they had still ensured both titles were now in Mercedes’ hands and it was perhaps taking a little while to sink in. “The sixth one, beating a record set by Ferrari 15 years ago is extremely special but I am not able to get it yet,” Wolff said.Indeed it was Vettel who gave his competitors a sportingly accurate assessment. “They are very close to perfection every time they go out on track,” he said. “So very consistent, very little mistakes. That’s certainly part of what makes them so strong.”Hamilton will move on swiftly, he has a title to secure and while his place in the history books is already assured, so too now is that of his team. He has always stressed that they win and lose together but while Japan might have felt personally like the latter, it is very much the former that has become the norm. So much so that this period of F1 will not be remembered by the engine formula that defines it but by the team that has dominated it. The Mercedes era.Red Bull’s Alexander Albon was in fourth, with Carlos Sainz in fifth for McLaren. Daniel Ricciardo came from 16th on the grid to sixth for Renault, with his teammate Nico Hülkenberg in tenth. However the FIA has sealed and impounded the Renault steering wheels and ECUs after a protest by Racing Point over their brake bias system that will now be investigated. Toro Rosso’s Pierre Gasly was eighth, with Racing Point’s Sergio Pérez in ninth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5af1a5bd0048a9d326ba90c33ab692ddffa21564/22_131_3845_2307/master/3845.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ca81ed8e141c4660f4c2965591e61fa","title":"japan scotland rugby world cup match report","story":"Some results deserve to be lit up in neon and this historic victory for Japan was one of them. Never before has any team from Asia reached the quarter-finals of a Rugby World Cup, let alone played such an inspirational brand of rugby. This was not just an emotional occasion for the host nation but an electrifying moment for the global game as a whole.Because this was finally the day when the patronising tier two label still used by some to denote Japan’s status in the sport officially ceased to exist. As was the case against Ireland, the Brave Blossoms were irresistible at times and were more than good value for their four-try success against a Scotland team who, for only the second time, are going home before the knockout stages commence.Japan now face South Africa in the last eight on Sunday, four years on from their famous 2015 win against the Springboks in Brighton.The backdrop to the whole occasion made this arguably even more special. Less than 12 hours earlier the fixture had still been in serious doubt, with Japan still reeling from the aftermath of Typhoon Hagibis that had left both death and destruction in its wake. Rugby, at such times, is usually an afterthought but Jamie Joseph’s inspiring team are providing their nation with at least a measure of solace.And it was Scotland who were on the receiving end. It was less a case of them playing or defending poorly and more another object lesson in Japanese excellence.The wing Kenki Fukuoka, scorer of the try that skewered the Irish, added two more big-occasion tries to his collection and he and his teammates led 28-7 at one stage before Gregor Townsend’s side mounted a valiant second-half fightback.Any team in the world would have loved to play as Japan did in the first half. Quick, smart, precise and innovative they were a credit to Joseph and his long-time coaching partner Tony Brown and rapidly forced Scotland into damage limitation mode. Despite an encouraging early score by Finn Russell, who had almost set up Darcy Graham for a try a few moments previously, the hosts were a red and white blur of constant motion and their three first-half tries were all out of the top drawer.As if Fukuoka’s offload for the first try by the increasingly prolific Kotaro Matsushima was not special enough, Japan were soon barrelling through the middle and Luke Thompson put his loosehead prop Keita Inagaki over by the posts. They would have been further ahead had Yu Tamura not missed a couple of penalty attempts but Scotland were not spared for long.With half-time approaching Japan poured forward down the left once more and the excellent Timothy Lafaele put in a neat grubber behind the Scottish defensive line. The ball bounced a little higher than Fukuoka might have liked but the buzzing winger still gathered it one-handed and surged past Stuart Hogg to score his side’s third try.Scotland could hardly complain about the 21-7 half-time margin, with Japan having enjoyed three-quarters of territory and possession and carried for 339 metres compared to 54. If they were relieved to see Jonny Gray avoid a card of any colour after a clash of heads with Shota Horie, they had increasingly little answer as Japan, with their skipper Michael Leitch again prominent, simply raised the tempo by another notch.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterWithin three minutes of the restart the Scottish centre Chris Harris was collared in his own half, had the ball ripped from his horrified grasp and Fukuoka tore unstoppably away for the try bonus point that effectively sealed Scotland’s fate.With the Scots also needing to win by more than seven points to make the qualification equation work, they basically required another Twickenham-style second-half resurrection. For a second or two, they hinted at a similar miracle.First the prop WP Nel crashed unstoppably over and then Russell, having taken a quick throw himself, sparked a glorious counterattack which ended with replacement Zander Fagerson scoring his side’s third try. The two blue-shirted flankers Jamie Ritchie and Magnus Bradbury could scarcely have given more but, ultimately, a couple of costly final-quarter errors killed both their momentum and their whole campaign.At least they were involved in one of the great World Cup occasions. From the pre-match silence in remembrance of the typhoon’s victims to the hair-on-the-neck emotion of the Japanese anthem and the vivid nature of the rugby, this was as good as anything at this tournament to date and up there among the most evocative spectacles the game has known. Maybe France’s comeback at Twickenham against New Zealand 20 years ago was more stunningly executed but not since South Africa won on home soil in 1995 has a host nation raised their game to such thrilling effect.At the final whistle, it really did feel as if rugby in Japan and had ascended to a whole new level. Were Scotland unlucky? Hardly. This was the first time they have lost a capped Test to Japan. On this evidence, it is unlikely to be the last."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d1041ea4a1321f43c9f1aaa600d2c72cf01d180/0_146_2967_1780/master/2967.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c356b09c6474a7e2f7b578d71e6daed4","title":"mo farah chicago marathon lawrence cherono","story":"A miserable fortnight for Mo Farah took a sharp turn for the worse in Chicago on Sunday as he trudged home more than four minutes behind the leaders in his worst ever marathon time. While the Kenyan Lawrence Cherono bounded to victory in 2hr 5min 45sec, Farah had pain etched across his face as he crossed the line in eighth place in a modest 2:09.58.Every time Britain’s most successful has run the marathon since retiring from the track in 2017, he has insisted that he is still learning how to best deal with going 26.2 miles.But on an unseasonally bitter day in the midwest, Farah learned perhaps the biggest lesson of all: that for all his devastating prowess on the track, when it comes to the ultimate test of distance running his old powers do not work nearly as well.Perhaps Farah’s poor performance can be partly attributed to outside factors. It cannot have been easy seeing his former coach Alberto Salazar banned for four years for doping offences – or UK Athletics dropping his personal physiotherapist and confidant, Neil Black, as performance director. Yet when Farah spoke to the press on Friday he promised he was in great form – and would not be distracted. But his increasingly punchy exchanges with the media, in which he appeared to be more critical of them than Salazar before accusing them of racism, can not have made for a smooth buildup.Either way, it was evident from early on that this was not going to be Farah’s day when he began to slip off a moderate pace after just eight miles. By the time the leaders went through halfway in 1:02.14, he was 40 seconds back in seventh and in no man’s land with just his training partner Bashir Abdi for company.True, Farah did at least perform better than the two Nike Oregon Project athletes still coached by Salazar – with his former friend Galen Rupp dropping out with a calf strain after 23 miles, and Jordan Hasay withdrawing after feeling a sharp pain in her hamstring after two miles.Increasingly, however, Farah looked every one of his 36 years. With 20 miles he was two minutes off the pace and looking like he wanted the ground to swallow him up. And while he deserves credit for continuing, this will be a bitter blow to his increasingly faint hopes of winning a marathon medal at the Olympic Games in Tokyo next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09f5c5be5959ec048506ed0bb4a5e484e85e77d0/0_64_5572_3343/master/5572.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba7ec285ec54259579f5136b5d367299","title":"simone biles gymnastics 24th medal world championship beam balance gold","story":"Simone Biles became the most decorated gymnast in world championship history on Sunday when she won the beam and floor finals to take her career tally to 25 medals.Soon after securing a convincing victory on the beam in Stuttgart to overtake Belarusian Vitaly Scherbo’s record tally of 23 world medals, the 22-year-old Biles successfully defended her floor title to win medal number 25.The four-time Olympic champion is now the owner of 19 gold medals across four championships against 12 for Scherbo, who competed in five world events between 1991 and 1996.Making her final appearance of the week in front of a raucous crowd, Biles wasted no time as she landed a superb triple-twisting double back flip – known as the ‘Biles II’ – on her first pass.Biles’s double layout with a half turn put her out of bounds for a 0.1 penalty but she did enough to post a winning score of 15.133.“Honestly, I just couldn’t move. I was so tired,” Biles said of her final pose on the stage. “This is really the best worlds performance I have ever put out.”The Americans took a one-two finish as Sunisa Lee finished with 14.133 for the silver medal, while Russian Angelina Melnikova came third.Earlier, Biles had delivered a polished routine on the beam before a full twisting double tuck dismount for an impressive 15.066. Although Biles had twice before won the world beam title, in 2014 and 2015, it has not always been plain sailing for her on the apparatus.Her slip on the landing of a front tucked somersault at the 2016 Rio Olympics meant she had to settle for a bronze in the event. Last year again, she dropped off the beam during the women’s all-around final at the world championships.But she has regained her swagger this week, under the watchful eyes of balance beam coach Cecile Landi, and posted top scores in all four attempts – qualifying, the team and all-around finals and Sunday’s apparatus final.“It meant a lot because Cecile has really been working on bringing my confidence back up to where it used to be on the beam,” Biles said. “To go out there and nail the routine, just like I do in practice, it felt really good and I knew she was really proud.”As another title-winning score was announced in the arena, Biles punched the air in jubilation before joining celebrations with the U.S. team.“I was really excited,” she added. “I thought it was going to be at least 14.8, 14.9, but to see 15, I was like well that’s pretty crazy, so I was very proud.” Last year’s winner Liu Tingting of China took silver with 14.433, while team mate Li Shijia won the bronze.Biles finished her campaign in Stuttgart with five gold medals from six events to mark ideal preparations for next year’s Tokyo Olympics. Her barnstorming run included a record fifth all-around gold, an inidual vault title, as well as helping the U.S. to a fifth straight world team title."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa1cacc85b98d95770532237795fd27829767fd3/0_67_4353_2613/master/4353.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f07b557262eccbafabcd9f7d1b491ec5","title":"japan typhoon rugby world cup","story":"It was a short silence, scarcely a minute, but there was so much in it. All the swirling, clashing, contradictory emotions of a match unlike any other that has ever been played, just hours after Typhoon Hagibis had blown through Japan, while the floodwaters were still high around the ground, the rescue work not finished, the repair work not even begun. No one was even sure exactly who, or how many, the silence was for. They were still counting the victims, and had been all day. At dawn the tally was four, then it climbed to nine. By the time they started the game it was 24, by half time it was 26, and it reached 28 soon after it was over.You’d ask, then, whether they should have even been playing. And World Rugby had exactly that conversation early on Sunday morning. They decided they had to defer to the Japanese members of the local organising committee. Why play sport, why watch it, while there were still so many people missing, when the levees are broken and the rivers are overflowing, when, in Kawasaki, 16 miles to the east of Yokohama, almost a million people had been evacuated in the night, and in Sagamihara, 30 miles to the north, they were still counting how many had died in a mudslide that wiped out a street of houses.For distraction, perhaps, and as a way of reclaiming some normality, as an act of defiance, even, a vital sign that we, at least, are alive and determined to enjoy what we’ve got.The hosts were driven by their sense of pride, too, but, according to an executive who was in on the meeting, the main reason, the one the Japanese officials kept coming back to, was that they wanted to prove to the world that they could do it.One of the reasons that the damage wasn’t worse here in Yokohama was that the stadium has been built in the middle of the flood basin that takes the overflow from the Tsurumi river. It’s built on stilts, to let the water run underneath. So the stadium is physically part of the city’s flood defences. And now it is spiritually part of them, too.Officials slept in the stadium on Saturday night, while the typhoon blew outside, so they could start assessing the damage the minute it stopped. At dawn the repair crews came in, and started pumping the floodwater out of the dressing room, where it was an inch deep, while the fire-service triple-checked all the electrics. Later they hosed down the pitch, to clear off the mud and debris. Meanwhile the organising committee were coordinating with the government and regional authorities, with all three emergency services, the water authorities, the road authorities, the train and bus companies, trying to untangle a cat’s cradle of complications.In Japan all the talk has been about how this World Cup is about omotenashi, Japanese hospitality. The word doesn’t exactly translate, but, in the sketchy understanding I have of it after four weeks here, it’s about doing more than your very best to please your guest.But this was several steps further again, well beyond what anyone could have expected. Which might be why so many people got it all so wrong in the days before the match. Why they imagined that Japan wanted to have this match cancelled, that they would rather have been awarded the draw than face the Scots, a team against whom they had only ever lost. They even suggested it was all part of some grand conspiracy to hobble the Scots.The chief executive of the Scottish Rugby Union, Mark Dodson, got it all wrong too. Dodson let fly about how the SRU had taken legal advice, raged how he wasn’t going to let his team be “collateral damage”. It was an embarrassingly wild misreading of what’s been going on here, of the mood among the Japanese, and how determined they were to play, and to win, this game.That silence gave way to the Japanese national anthem, Kimigayo. They have a complicated relationship with the song in Japan. There are a lot of people who prefer not to sing it. Which is why, during this tournament, they have been running a campaign encouraging the fans to join in with it. Tens of thousands did here, a stirring, solemn rendition that seemed to swell louder and louder until it echoed all around the city. And you knew then that Scotland were done for, that they were up against a team who were being driven by powerful forces, far beyond anything they had to muster themselves, a team who, like their country, were determined to prove to everyone that they could.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterIn that first half Japan unleashed a 30-minute spell of rugby of such ferocity, such focus, and intent, it would have cut apart any team in the tournament, including South Africa, who they will play on Sunday.

David is probably safe this week, which leaves Chris, Dev and Emma W at the mercy of the public – Chris and Dev are both popular with the viewers, so I’m putting my money on an AlexEmma W dance-off, which Emma will probably win.Kick off is at 7.15pm, feel free to watch along as this theory is proved to be a load of old rubbish – if there’s one thing we’ve learned from Strictly over the years, there’s always at least one shock eviction that causes us all to throw our toys out of the pram. Could be this week, let’s wait and see. Have managed to avoid spoilers so far! Thank you all for joining in with your comments, I’ll be back here tomorrow for the Results Show at 7.15pm, so don’t forget to come back. In the meantime you can find me on Twitter @heidistephens if you want to say hello. Enjoy the rest of your Saturday, and I’ll see you tomorrow! HxSo that’s it for the dancing, and the voting is now open! Karim and Amy and Kelvin and Oti are at the top of the leaderboard, with Alex and Neil and Will and Janette at the bottom. Scoring tonight was even more bonkers than usual, and the music choices were a bit crackers too. Time for a recap – my votes this evening would go to Emma and Anton, Kelvin and Oti and Dev and Dianne. Oh hang on, forgot Michelle. How many votes am I allowed?Who do you reckon for the bottom two? Tough one to call this week – feels like Chris and Karen and Alex and Neil might be a possibility, or maybe Emma and Aljaz? Could be any one of half a dozen couples this week, the mad scoring has thrown everything wide open.Scores: 9,10,9,10 – a total of 38 for Karim and Amy. Ditching the panda suit was a very good idea. Shirley thought it was an amazing close to the show – Karim kept the frame throughout. Bruno thought it had power, passion and precision, Karim killed it. Craig loved finally seeing a male celebrity lead and it was incredible. Motsi thought it was the best dance of the evening.I have no idea what’s real any more.

Thomas Piketty, the French economist, has just published his follow-up to the bestselling Capital. Titled Capital and Ideology, it expands on the themes of the first book. Sales of Capital topped 2m copies but have not put him in the running, possibly because at 48 he is too young to have built up enough citations among economists.Thomas Sowell, 89, has the track record and another bestselling book under his belt, but fails to make the cut. Sowell is a senior fellow at the Hoover institution, Stanford University, and his brand of laissez-faire, anti-government economics is at the opposite end of the spectrum to the leftwing Piketty.He has followed up Economic Facts and Fallacies and Black Rednecks and White Liberals with a new book, Discrimination and Disparities.Clarivate Analytics said it ranked academics by the number of citations they have gathered throughout their careers because it is “a quantitative narrative of how their discoveries have influenced their peers, the broader scientific community and the world at large”.Last year the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which will announce the prizewinner on Monday for the Sveriges Riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel, rewarded two economists, William Nordhaus and Paul Romer.They were honoured for their research into two of the most “basic and pressing” economic issues of the age. Nordhaus, a Yale economist, warned policymakers in the 1970s that their economic models were not properly taking account of the impact of global warming.Romer was praised for his work on endogenous growth theory, the notion that countries can improve their underlying performance if they concentrate on supply-side measures such as research and development, innovation and skills. Moving away from classical models that rely on the private sector to boost investment, he urges governments to intervene to boost R\u0026ampD and skills."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/663d36f3bd33b78c4c44b44ce1813b8d978cc883/0_0_4400_2640/master/4400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f744234932c3a7e2740acee850b63a54","title":"john henry newman is first briton to be canonised in 43 years","story":"Prince Charles described Victorian theologian as a ‘fearless defender of the truth’ Prince Charles described John Henry Newman as a “fearless defender of the truth” after the British cardinal became a saint in front of an estimated 20,000 pilgrims in St Peter’s Square.Newman, also a theologian, scholar and poet, was regarded as one of the most influential figures of the Victorian age and is the first Briton to be made a saint since 1976, when John Ogilvie was canonised by Pope Paul VI.“In this age, during which he has been made a saint, Newman’s example remains compelling and relevant,” Charles said during a reception after the canonisation in Vatican City on Sunday.“He was able to advocate without accusation and, perhaps most of all, to see differences as places of encounter rather than exclusion … these are principles that continue to inspire and to guide each new generation.“Today is a cause of celebration for us all … he was a priest, poet and thinker ahead of his time, and perhaps above all, he was a fearless defender of the truth whose impact on the world was as profound as it is enduring.”Newman, born in London in 1801, was a Church of England priest before controversially converting to Catholicism in 1845.His journey towards sainthood began after the Vatican declared that it was due to his intercession that two people, Jack Sullivan and Melissa Villalobos, were miraculously cured from serious illnesses. Sullivan, an American deacon who had suffered a spine condition, and Villalobos, who suffered life-threatening complications when pregnant with her fifth child, attended the canonisation.Sullivan, who had been told he would end up paralysed, described the pain endured as “being on a higher level than a woman going through labour”. Newman was beatified in 2010 after Pope Benedict XV approved Sullivan’s recovery.Pope Francis then credited Newman with curing Villalobos, who went on to have two more children.“It’s such a joyous day for me to see Newman become a saint,” Villalobos said. “I feel like I’ve been waiting for this since the minute I was created and here it is. Some people lived an entire life hoping for his canonisation and it never came, so it’s a real blessing to see it and be part of it.”Both Sullivan and Villalobos, from Chicago, became devoted to Newman after watching a show dedicated to him on EWTN, a Catholic TV channel.“I was struck by his tenderness, which came across when I read his letters,” added Villalobos. “He was a colossal genius, an intellectual powerhouse. And he also had a tremendous loving heart.”Newman was declared a saint by Pope Francis alongside four women – Brazilian sister Dulce Lopes Pointes Swiss laywoman Marguerite Bays Indian sister Mariam Thresia and Italian sister Giuseppine Vannini.He was known as a powerful preacher whose sermons could change lives. Some 15,000 people lined the streets for his funeral in Birmingham in 1890.Linda, a lay chaplain from Nottingham who did not wish to give her surname, travelled to Rome with her family. She said: “For me, Newman was a person who struggled but never gave up. He wanted the laity to have knowledge, not just blindly follow the faith.”It was after a trip to Rome in 1833 that Newman felt called to the Oxford Movement, which sought to renew the Church of England by returning it to its Catholic sources. On converting to Catholicism, he instructed bishops to “listen to the laity”.Newman also helped reform Oxford University and founded University College Dublin.“Newman represents integrity and the importance of struggling to find wholeness in the self,” said Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Westminster. “His view on education, for example, was very much against the manipulation of education purely for economic reasons.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29e64c6aa53996f93c7a7de31a9b3dfa620823ef/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2616ee7ae9df3c1d6feea60687b85c74","title":"the kurds a bitter history of betrayal","story":"Donald Trump has given the green light for a Turkish invasion of Kurdish territory. He’s not the first US leader to turn his back on this ethnic groupThe old Kurdish proverb is quoted so often that it would be hackneyed if it were not so true. An ethnic minority of about 30 million people spread across the Middle East, the Kurds have “no friends but the mountains”, they say. The aphorism proved itself again this week.The Kurds, the fourth-largest ethnic group in the region, have been campaigning for their own state since the late 1800s. In the dismemberment of the Ottoman empire that followed the first world war, they saw their chance. The boundaries of a possible Kurdistan were considered in the negotiations after the 1918 armistice, but after Turkey fought back, the French and British tore up those plans and ided Kurdish-inhabited lands between Turkey, Iraq and Syria.A short-lived Kurdish kingdom inside modern-day Iraq was crushed by 1924 with the assistance of the British.Last week’s decision by the White House not to stand in the way of Turkish invasion builds on a bitter history of Kurds being embraced, then spurned by capricious American administrations going back to 1975.That year, Iraqi president Saddam Hussein made a surprise peace deal with the Shah of Iran. American guns and money that had been flowing to the Kurdish peshmerga forces fighting Hussein were abruptly cut off. The Iraqi dictator’s army promptly counterattacked the stranded Kurdish fighters.By the 1980s, the Americans viewed Hussein more favourably. The Ronald Reagan administration continued supporting his war against the now-Islamic Republic of Iran even as his soldiers gassed and bombed Kurdish communities in a campaign that Iraqi courts have now recognised as a genocide. A chemical weapons attack in the northern city of Halabja in March 1988 killed up to 5,000 people, mostly civilians.In 1990 Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait turned him back into an American enemy. A US-led force pushed Iraq out of Kuwait and the George Bush administration encouraged Iraq’s Shiites and Kurds to rise up against Hussein’s regime. Iraq’s southern uprising was crushed, but resistance in the north, followed by the imposition of a no-fly zone by western forces led by a UK initiative, allowed the creation of an autonomous Kurdish zone which became an autonomous republic. This ultimately failed as they got no US support and were routed when the Iraqi army regrouped.The Kurdish nationalist struggle had a resurgence in Turkey in the 1980s with the formation of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK). The militant group has waged a guerrilla war against the Turkish state for 35 years. The conflict has killed an estimated 40,000 people and the PKK is classified as a terrorist group by the US, EU and UK, among others.In the chaos of the Syrian civil war, Kurdish fighters took control of key cities from the Syrian army, and defended them from Islamic State when the group began to expand after 2014. The US, desperate for a reliable ally in Syria, assisted the Kurdish fight against IS with air strikes and, eventually, money and weapons. Turkey watched the budding alliance with increasing alarm.After last week’s phone call with the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Trump surprised the world – and many in his own administration – by announcing US troops would stand aside, effectively allowing the Turkish army to enter north-eastern Syria and clear the border areas of the Kurdish fighters that Ankara considers to be terrorists, and who until a few days ago were the US’s staunchest allies in the fight against IS."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26cdfcec7a99cdf9af6a589ee7d0ae617e43c2a8/0_390_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ee7f0378cb609411b9724cb94e19130","title":"winston trew to clear his name","story":"Jamaican was one of ‘Oval Four’ jailed in London in 1972 in controversial circumstances“I am out of prison but the conviction is still on my record,” a 23-year-old Winston Trew told his local south London paper when he was released from jail in 1973. “We wanted to clear our names. The wounds are too painful to leave it at that. Prison was horrible. At first we were full of hope that we would be released but everything seemed to drag on … I shall try to get some redress for my bitter experience.”He could hardly have imagined that it would be another 46 years before that redress finally arrived.Born in Jamaica in 1950, Trew was the son of a police officer in what was still a colonial force. His parents came to England in the early 1950s as part of the Windrush generation. Winston, his older sister and two younger brothers joined them in London shortly afterwards.After leaving school and having embarked on a government training course in electrical engineering, he became involved in politics. In 1970, he joined the Fasimbas (Young Lions), the youth wing of an organisation called the South East London Parents’ Organisation. One of their roles was educating youngsters of Caribbean origin about their backgrounds and history and helping those with reading problems as part of their education at a supplementary school.On the night of his arrest, Trew had been at a meeting in north London and was on his way home. The effect of his arrest and imprisonment was enormous.“It shattered me,” he said this week. “My marriage broke up. I lost confidence and I felt incredibly lonely.” His father had died in 1959 and the trial and sentence caused great distress to his mother. Derek Ridgewell was the detective sergeant who led the arrests.Trew said: “Ridgewell threw a hand grenade into my life and shattered it but I am not a person who gives up easily. Over the years I managed to rebuild my life and restore my confidence.”After jail, he worked briefly for Aims of Industry whose head, Michael Ivens, was active in the Howard League for Penal Reform. He also wrote for Time Out and City Limits magazines on such topics as the “sus” laws – which enabled police officers to stop and search members of the public even if they had no hard evidence that a crime had been committed – the Notting Hill carnival riots and the 1981 New Cross fire in which 13 young black people died. It was through a news story in Time Out in 1980 that he first learned that Ridgewell had been arrested but he was told that an appeal at that stage had little chance of success.He took a degree in social sciences at the North East London Polytechnic (now the University of East London) and went into youth work for a number of years before joining South Bank University as a lecturer in social sciences from 1987 to 2000. He suffered a stroke in 2003 and, as part of his recovery, he researched his case again, using the Freedom of Information Act and found out that Ridgewell had died in prison. His book on the case, Black for a Cause, was published in 2010."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit a day in the life of an irish border crossing","story":"Ambrose “Bo” McGurgan is checking the tyres on his six-axle lorry at the Applegreen truck stop near Castlebellingham, Co Louth, south of the Irish Border. It is the only check he will undergo before crossing over into Northern Ireland.From the end of this month all that could change with the UK’s exit from the EU on October 31st, the date British prime minister Boris Johnson wants Brexit to happen.McGurgan fears the return of the dreaded customs checks of more than a quarter century ago. He remembers the hard border when 300 or 400 trucks could be parked up for hours awaiting customs clearance.“It will be going back to square one, like in the 70s. It would be a disaster. You could be sitting all day in Dundalk waiting to get cleared,” he tells The .It is 11am on a Monday and the Armagh man has been working for six hours and has already lifted and “tipped” a trailer in Dublin and is heading across the Border for another delivery in Newtownards, Co Down.He is hauling a mixed load of food and industrial goods – sauces and engineering bolts – but requires no paperwork as he drives, unhindered, across an open border between two jurisdictions currently within the EU. A return to the border of the past, that McGurgan waited hours to cross. is very real again.Johnson’s government proposed to the EU last week to replace the contentious backstop guarantee to avoid a hard Irish border with a plan to impose a new customs border on the island of Ireland.The deluge of paperwork, the queues of lorries, the hours-long delays, the potential targeting of customs officers by people upset with the return of a visible border “would be a disaster,” says McGurgan.“People don’t realise how bad it is going to be. We, the older generation, we have done it all. We know how bad it is. There will be customs men shot. There will be. Everybody is fighting for a loaf,” he said.McGurgan’s truck was one of 6,639 goods vehicles to cross the Border on the A1 dual-carriageway between Dublin and Belfast last Monday. This is the busiest crossing on the Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Traffic counters operated by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the agency monitoring the State’s roads, show that on average five goods vehicles crossed this point of the Border every minute on Monday.This is where the impact of the UK leaving without a deal has the potential to cause the most complications.Next to McGurgan’s truck is fellow haulier Brendan McParland, also a veteran Border-crosser. He is heading to Dungannon, Co Tyrone, with a load of peat after dropping plasterboard in Athy, Co Kildare.He usually hauls European steel, landed at Warrenpoint in Co Down, across the Border to Dublin, Kilkenny or Carlow. Normally he can complete two return runs to Dublin in one day from Warrenpoint.“If the Border was to come, you couldn’t guarantee you would even get one load done,” he said, munching on a sandwich in the cab of his lorry.Michael Harbinson is one of several lorry drivers stopped at Applegreen transporting Coca-Cola products from its manufacturing facility in Knockmore Hill outside Belfast to customers in the Republic.He believes an all-island economic unit is the way to avoid a hard Border. Not everyone wants this when it comes to both customs and EU single market rules north and south. The DUP also wants Northern Ireland to be able to vote to opt in to an all-island zone covering EU single market rules for goods every four years.“If the North takes a deal still tied with the South, it is the best of both worlds. It is the DUP who is ruining it. They just stand firm in their stance,” said Harbinson.At the last junction before the southern M1-N1 crosses the Border and turns into the northern A1 there is a fuel service station. It lies between Jonesborough, Co Armagh, and Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.Colin Byrne, one of the pump attendants of the junction 20 service station, has no clue how the UK and EU would manage this Border if Britain leaves without a deal.“That’s the six million dollar question. Sure how many back roads are there across the Border. It is not doable, simply not doable,” he said.Johnson has ruled out customs checks at or near the Border but has not specified in his plan where “designated locations” for some required checks might be. Byrne offers a foretaste of how checks might work: “every once in a while,” he says, the Garda and customs check vehicles at the southbound exit 18 off the M1 into Dundalk. “If you saw the mayhem that that causes,” he said.On the bridge over the A1 dual-carriageway next to the Carrickdale Hotel there is a constant drone of noise as an “artic” or smaller “rigid” lorry or a light goods vehicle is always coming or going.This is the north-south White Van Man highway.Between 5am and 7pm last Monday – the busiest period of the day – 5,722 goods vehicles cross the Border. That is one goods vehicle every eight seconds. This traffic is split 50:50 in either direction.“It shows trade is equally balanced going in either direction,” said Séamus Leheny, policy manager of the Freight Transport Association, speaking loudly to be heard over the hum of traffic on the bridge.“It is the artery of trade on the island of Ireland. It connects the two largest cities and to have any type of barrier on this, or ersions, or checks, it would inhabit trade and growth economically on either side of the Border here.”Interrupting the flow of traffic here would have a huge impact, he says lorries would “soon stack up” and could be waiting hours if they had to have paperwork inspected or their load physically inspected.The stakes on finding a fix to the Brexit-Border conundrum are high. Leheny explains that five times as much freight crosses the Irish Border than moves between Northern Ireland and Britain, the North’s biggest market, but it is lower in value because it is mostly ingredients and components, and not completed products.“What we make in Northern Ireland, it is comprised of bits and pieces sourced from every corner of the island of Ireland. If we have a hard border, the existence of those products that we make in Northern Ireland are jeopardised because you would have delays, tariffs and the sanitary controls as well,” he said.In the retail game, this Border crossing is an essential supply chain route for multinationals. Northern Ireland supermarkets are stocked from distribution centres in the Republic, and vice versa. Then there are the food products made with ingredients coming from both north and south of the Border.Aodhán Michael Connolly, director of Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, says that a supermarket chicken salad sandwich can have ingredients involving six border movements (north-south and east-west, between the North and Britain), while “the humble cottage pie” can have eight, including a cheese topping produced and processed on different sides of the Border. Each movement involves tariffs so the overall costs could be huge.“That border crossing isn’t just to move goods A to B. It is a lifeline to the supply chain and to those small and medium-sized enterprises right down to the farmers who are in our supply chain,” he said. “If there isn’t frictionless movement across that border, each of those costs will have to go down the supply chain and it is going to make things tougher for the Northern Ireland consumer.”Connolly sees Johnson’s plan as “unworkable” if it is the final deal because a customs border would amount to a hard border, but it is “progress” to open negotiations because it includes an all-island zone for goods.Driving one of his nine trucks across the Border on the A1, Declan Trainor, a cattle and goods haulier, believes the island of Ireland should be “treated as a whole and as one island”.He has no idea how the Border, just a few hundred metres from his office at Carrickcarnan, will look on November 1st, or how he will be able to continue transporting tiles from mainland Europe to Northern Ireland.“It is the unknown. That is the scary part. The Government hasn’t really said how to prepare for it. They are only guessing themselves now so how are you supposed to prepare?” he said. “You don’t know whether it is a dance you are going to or a war. Sure how do you dress for it?”Speaking a few days later, Trainor says Johnson’s “two borders for four years” proposal has left him even more confused. It has also made people who rely on free trade and free movement of goods across the Border “desperate,” he said.“Whatever concern we had, we are more concerned now,” he said.How busy is the M1A1\u0026nbspcrossing?The Border crossing on the M1 motorwayA1 dual-carriageway between Dublin and Belfast is the busiest thoroughfare along the 499-kilometre open frontier between the Republic and Northern Ireland.The four-lane crossing between Newry and Dundalk is about five times busier than the next busiest crossing over the Blackwater river between Emyvale, Co Monaghan, and Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone, based on traffic figures counted daily by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the State agency that manages the Irish road network.The agency uses a system of counters under the surface of strategically important roads across the country that can differentiate vehicles by wheel axle lengths. This allows the agency to gather data and analyse the volume of traffic and type of vehicles passing on the road for every hour of every day.The counter at Junction 20 on the A1 at Ravensdale between Jonesborough, Co Armagh, and Carrickcarnan, Co Louth, showed that Monday, September 30th – a month before the UK’s scheduled exit from the EU – was a typically busy day for traffic for this major transport route on the island of Ireland.Some 25,301 vehicles crossed the Border over the 24-hour period: 18,175 cars, 6,639 goods vehicles (including the heaviest articulated lorries), 318 buses and 24 motorbikes. That means 17 vehicles crossed the Border on average every minute last Monday. One goods vehicle crossed the Border every 12 seconds.Hauliers, traders and businesses along the Border say any kind of delays stopping traffic on this corridor after Brexit would quickly result in heavy congestion and tailbacks.The busiest times of day are during the morning rush-hour between 8am and 9am, when traffic volumes peaked at 1,935 vehicles, and the late afternoon peak between 4pm and 5pm at 1,897 vehicles.The bulk of the traffic crosses the Border between the hours of 7am and 7pm when 19,625 vehicles were counted last Monday, or on average of 1,635 an hour.The traffic is evenly split between northbound and southbound vehicles. However, more than twice as many goods vehicles head southbound between 5am and 9am – making deliveries to the Republic or transporting goods to Dublin Port in time to make the 8am ferry departures to England out of Dublin Port.This route is a critical artery for goods travelling from Northern Ireland south into the Republic. Some 3,425 goods vehicles crossed the Border heading south into the Republic last Monday.This worked out an average of 143 per hour. In other words, one goods vehicle crossed the Border into the Republic on the main Dublin-Belfast road every 25 seconds last Monday.To put this in a national context, this part of the A1 is almost as busy or busier every day than the main Dublin to Galway M4 road at Kinnegad (26,400 vehicles on average a day), the main Dublin to Cork M7 road at Portlaoise (25,700 vehicles) and than the main Dublin to Wexford M11 road at Arklow (22,800 vehicles).Cross-Border workersTen minutes drive south of the Border, dozens of parked cars – nearly all Northern Irish-registered vehicles – line either side of the road off Junction 17 of the M1 near Dundalk in Co Louth.They belong to Northern Irish tradesmen, mostly from across the Border in south Armagh, who park and car-pool into the Republic for work. They are mostly construction works, plumbers and electricians.“There are thousands of people going to and from work every day, crossing the Border every couple of minutes. There are thousands and thousands of guys down south working and Dublin is most of where the work is,” said Neil Byrne, a plumber from Mullaghbane near Forkhill.The Armagh man usually arrives at around 5.50am to park his car and catch his lift to Dublin. He has worked “all over the south” including in Kildare and Athlone.Byrne says he and his fellow commuters to the Republic are concerned about a crash-out Brexit and the return of a hard border resulting in hours and hours of traffic delays crossing the Border.He doesn’t believe a hard border would work it does not make sense to have one, he says. “It is one small country in my opinion: it doesn’t matter whether you are north or south, Ireland is Ireland and you have to get to your work regardless,” he said.Delays and traffic jams are not his only worry.“If there’s a Border, it has the whole issue of the Troubles starting again because in my own personal opinion it is going to happen the exact same way it did back then: customs guys get attacked, then there is a police presence, then they get attacked and then there is a military presence,” he said. “It doesn’t take much to set it off.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The first is that the Church must listen to its local congregations, or laity the second is that Church teaching, or doctrine, “develops” over time. At present, the Amazon has a chronic shortage of priests. Some reformers insist that what the locals want most is the ordination of married men, not just to raise recruitment but to reflect better the culture of the region.Conservatives say that if the Amazonians cannot understand celibacy then it is the job of the Church to explain it to them. Conservatives call this the mission of the Church some liberals regard it as closer to European colonialism.As Vatican City was abuzz ahead of Sunday\u0027s events, Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke, often dubbed America\u0027s leading clerical critic of Pope Francis, told The  in Rome that he was praying to Newman to “intercede” to protect the Church from error. Pope Francis arrives to celebrate the Canonisation Mass for John Henry NewmanInfluential figures like the journalist Christopher Lamb, on the other hand, argue that Newman would have approved of the synod. “His spirit is now here,” he says. “The ideas that he put forward have now embedded in the Church.”Mr Lamb has accused some Catholics in the media of making “demeaning, xenophobic and at times racist remarks” against indigenous peoples during the synod.He sees Newman as having been critical of an over mighty, Euro-centric church and favouring greater decentralisation.“The power of the Catholic Church is that you can be totally part of your local culture but also part of the universal church,” he says. “That’s what Newman was.”Cardinal Burke, however, fears Newman is sometimes subject to misinterpretation.Sitting in his Roman apartment, with letters by Newman framed on the wall, the cardinal suggests that the Church can only properly consult communities on faith matters when that community is already Catholic.“For instance, in the working document of the synod it says that when we go into these pagan places and places where the gospel hasn’t been preached, we go there looking for revelation in the culture itself.”The synod\u0027s preparatory document calls “the Lordship of Christ… into question because Christ is just one more element of what they call the Cosmos”. The cardinal is careful with his words, but grassroots conservative clergy are increasingly more outspoken. Over lunch near the Vatican, Fr Ed Tomlinson, a parish priest from Kent, argues that the Amazon question is being used for a broader assault on Church teaching by Sixties liberals. “What we’ve really got is the boomer generation once again trying to sell us the sexual revolution… speaking through the mask of the Amazon because it a) hides their true motives and b) it means anyone who criticises them can be described as racist.”A portrait of Cardinal Newman by Sir John Everett Millais hangs in the National Portrait GalleryHe finds it suspicious that there is such an overlap between the aims of European liberal priests and indigenous peoples: “It just seems a little neat to me.”Rev Dr Stephen Morgan, a Catholic deacon, suggests that the subtlety of Newman’s teaching is being lost.Conservatives are worried that the synod is being used to tweak practices in a way that will fundamentally alter not just the appearance but the character, even the beliefs of the Catholic Church.Some fear the Synod for the Pan-Amazon Region could open the way to married priestsOn the other hand, Austen Ivereigh, a sympathetic biographer of Pope Francis, says that ultimately “consultation and deliberation on matters of Church discipline and faith are now part of the norm of this pontificate and here’s an obvious link with Newman’s teachings”.Although he was a thorough believer in Catholic doctrine and authority, Newman, says Ivereigh, disliked authoritarianism and centralisation “in a very English way…. He is a person who very honesty looks for the truth and is prepared to go wherever the truth takes him.“He is a conscience hero. That’s very modern,” says Ivereigh, suggesting that this is perhaps what makes him so appealing today. Newman “is a searcher, and we live in an age of religious searching, he adds.Vatican City and Holy SeeBritish orphans missing in northern Syria after mass escape of Islamic State families Domestic rabbits often lead miserable, disease-ridden lives because owners wrongly believe they need minimal careHollywood stars attend Saudi Arabia film showcase year after Khashoggi killingHarry Dunn: Parents reject apology from Anne Sacoolas as they fly to the United StatesRobert de Niro says rise of CGI means career could be \u0026#39extended another 30 years\u0026#39US meets Taliban in attempt to revive Afghanistan talksBoris Johnson tells Cabinet there is a \u0026#39way forward\u0026#39 to achieve a Brexit deal that respects Good Friday AgreementPolice officer stabbed in the neck in latest Hong Kong clashesAway from Washington, Democrats try to sell impeachment to an uncertain nationWho will win Strictly Come Dancing 2019?

Thirty five per cent mentioned concerns about tariffs, while the jumpy exchange rate was a deterrent for 33 per cent of respondents.Only 7 per cent of firms said they do not face any obstacles.A number of academic studies have found that uncertainty over future trade policies hampers trade.In the UK, exporters may be struggling to sign new contracts with customers in the EU because it is unclear what, if any, tariffs will apply by the time the goods are delivered.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Richard Ratcliffe, husband of British-Iranian aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe jailed in Tehran since 2016, holds his daughter Gabriella during a news conference in London.

The club will lose their membership at midnight if they don\u0027t find a buyer or prove that they have the means to pay off their debtsThe problem is amplified for customers in countries further afield that have a free trade agreement with the EU, giving Britain preferential access while it is still a member. For goods arriving in those countries by ship, delivery takes even longer, making it harder to sign contracts weeks in advance when it is unclear what tariffs will apply.Pricing has also been difficult, with the pound whipsawing in line with the latest Brexit developments.“Importers and exporters are in limbo, and many are postponing investment decisions, while they await further information,” said Edward Winterton, UK chief executive at Bibby Financial Services.“Many others are focusing resources on ensuring they’re prepared to deal with the potential impacts of a no-deal scenario.”British exports fell sharply in the second quarter to the lowest level in almost three years, according to the latest official data, adjusted for inflation.Although some of the drop was probably caused by a weaker global economy, academic research published in December 2018 also identified a Brexit effect. The researchers found that since the EU referendum, growth in British exports had been much slower than it would have been had the vote never taken place. The trend is “clear and consistent” for exports both to EU and non-EU countries, they wrote.Much of the uncertainty cited by UK exporters has to do with the repeated delays to Brexit, but even once Britain leaves the EU, questions about future trade relationships will remain. For example, the UK will have to negotiate its own trade deals with countries where it currently has one via its EU membership, such as Japan and Canada, and that will take time.The BCC surveyed 1,140 internationally active businesses between 10 and 30 July.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For goods arriving in those countries by ship, delivery takes even longer, making it harder to sign contracts weeks in advance when it is unclear what tariffs will apply.Pricing has also been difficult, with the pound whipsawing in line with the latest Brexit developments.“Importers and exporters are in limbo, and many are postponing investment decisions, while they await further information,” said Edward Winterton, UK chief executive at Bibby Financial Services.“Many others are focusing resources on ensuring they’re prepared to deal with the potential impacts of a no-deal scenario.”British exports fell sharply in the second quarter to the lowest level in almost three years, according to the latest official data, adjusted for inflation.Although some of the drop was probably caused by a weaker global economy, academic research published in December 2018 also identified a Brexit effect. The researchers found that since the EU referendum, growth in British exports had been much slower than it would have been had the vote never taken place. The trend is “clear and consistent” for exports both to EU and non-EU countries, they wrote.Much of the uncertainty cited by UK exporters has to do with the repeated delays to Brexit, but even once Britain leaves the EU, questions about future trade relationships will remain. For example, the UK will have to negotiate its own trade deals with countries where it currently has one via its EU membership, such as Japan and Canada, and that will take time.The BCC surveyed 1,140 internationally active businesses between 10 and 30 July.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The store stocks more than 100,000 LPs and CDs, and it is the first retailer to offer every film available in\u0026nbsp4K UHD, which amounts to 20,000 Blu-ray and more than\u0026nbsp40,000 DVD titles.The\u0026nbspVault, located close to the city centre, also features a performance space designed for concerts by international and local musicians. Liam Payne will perform at the store’s launch on Friday, followed by James Arthur on Saturday. The Murder Capital and local bands will play over the opening weekend.“I am a firm believer in the potential for British high street retail,” said Doug Putman, owner of HMV.“Retail offers two things a purely digital experience of music simply can’t – the opportunity to experience the biggest acts live in our stores and our ability to offer a platform to new artists in the communities where we operate, as well as opportunities for fans to come together and share their passion for music and film with our dedicated staff.”Created with Sketch.

It was seen churning out its first ever stars: supermassive objects that are only at the very beginning of their lives.“It’s this little blue smudge, meaning it’s a very small galaxy that contains a lot of super-hot, very massive young stars that formed recently,” says Matthew\u0026nbspBayliss, a research scientist in\u0026nbspMIT’s\u0026nbspKavli\u0026nbspInstitute for Astrophysics and Space Research. “This galaxy is similar to the very first galaxies that formed in the universe … the kind of which no one has ever seen in X-ray in the distant universe before.”Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberScientists now hope they can use the same technique to see other extreme and energetic events so far away that they happened right at the very beginning of the universe.“With this technique, we could, in the future, zoom in on a distant galaxy and age-date different parts of it –\u0026nbspto say, this part has stars that formed 200 million years ago, versus another part that formed 50 million years ago, and pick them apart in a way you cannot otherwise do,” said\u0026nbspBayliss.Nasa releases ‘peculiar’ recordings from surface of MarsThe technique relies on one of the strangest characteristics of such huge galaxy clusters: they are the most massive objects in the universe, so huge and powerful that they distort the very fabric of space-time. As they do, the universe and its light is bent.That can be used something like a magnifying glass, because of a phenomenon known as\u0026nbspgravitational lensing. Using complex processing, scientists can examine the light and use it to see magnified images.Researchers have been able to use this before to study objects at optical wavelengths. But the new research is a breakthrough because they have never before usedit to examine the X-ray band of the\u0026nbspelectromagnetic spectrum, which is so difficult that some thought it might be impossible.“If you’re trying to see an X-ray source behind a cluster, it’s like trying to see a candle next to a really bright light, said\u0026nbspBayliss. “So we knew this was a challenging measurement to make.”To get around that problem, researchers used Nasa\u0027s\u0026nbspChandra\u0026nbspX-ray Observatory, one of the most powerful X-ray telescopes in the world. With that, they were able to start looking deeper and deeper into the universe – including at such infant galaxies.“We’re catching this galaxy at a very useful stage, where it’s got these really young stars,”\u0026nbspBayliss\u0026nbspsays. “Every galaxy had to start out in this phase, but we don’t see a lot of these kinds of galaxies in our own\u0026nbspneighborhood. Now we can go back in time, look in the distant universe, find galaxies in this early phase of their life, and start to study how star formation is different there.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Former Google chair\u0026nbspEric Schmidt was questioned in 2014 about Google supporting a climate change-denying pressure group, to which he responded that it was “some sort of mistake”.He told the radio host who questioned him about it that Google “should not be aligned with such people” and said that it wouldn’t happen again.But the company continues to provide financial backing to controversial groups, with a spokesperson telling : “We’re hardly alone among companies that contribute to organisations while strongly disagreeing with them on climate policy.”In September, Google employees joined workers from other tech firms in a mass walkout to support the Global Climate Strike.\u0026nbspIn a blog post at the time, the Google Workers for Action on Climate group highlighted some of the deals and funding that the company was involved with that contradicted its public stance on climate change.Need another reason to support a four day week? Climate change“Google Cloud makes significant revenue licensing infrastructure, machine learning,\u0026nbspand engineering talent to fossil fuel companies, promising to help them extract fuel reserves faster,” the post stated.\u0026nbsp“Also, Google invests in the deadly status quo. In 2018 the company funded 111 members of congress who voted against climate legislation at least 90 per cent of the time.”Ahead of the worker strike, Google announced “the biggest corporate purchase of renewable energy in history”, which included 18 new energy deals that will increase its portfolio of wind and solar agreements by 40 per cent.The workers group hopes Google will go further than this by ending all contracts with fossil fuel companies and eliminating\u0026nbspfunding for climate-denying lobbyists and politicians.“As iniduals, we may feel alone in facing climate change,” the group stated. “But if we act together – if we act now – we can build a better future.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

By sharing details of the phone, the technology giant was attempting to take back the narrative from the leakers, gossips and rumour merchants that fill the pages of the tech press in the build-up to a major product launch.But the limited amount of information imparted only seemed to serve as bait, with publications picking apart each picture\u0026nbspto determine what hardware features to expect. Along with dual-rear cameras, the images also revealed an additional sensor that became noticeable when the contrast of one image was adjusted.Moreover, Google\u0027s revelations didn\u0027t prevent the usual slew of rumours, with Google and its production partners seemingly more leaky than dear Liza\u0027s bucket.The official unveiling of the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL will take place on 15 October at an event in New York City, but with little left to announce it will likely be almost entirely ceremonial. For those not keen on sitting through a two hour presentation, The Independent\u0026nbsphas a run down of everything that\u0027s expected to be announced.As with most smartphone makers this year, the main upgrade for Google\u0027s latest device will almost certainly be the camera.Both the front- and rear-facing cameras will see considerable improvements, with an additional 16-megapixel telephoto lens at the back being complimented by complex sensors at the front that will enable the same depth-aware facial recognition that is featured on the latest\u0026nbspiPhones.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Google celebrates its 21st birthday on September 27.

As always, Google\u0027s own devices were the first to include Android 10 and so there is no doubt it will appear on the two new Pixel 4 phones.One of the most highly-anticipated features of Android 10 is Live Caption, which uses artificial intelligence to automatically transcribe speech from audio or videos playing on the phone.AFPGetty Images)Whilst fundamentally an accessibility feature, allowing deaf and hard-of-hearing users to better consume content, it will also be a perk to anyone hoping to surreptitiously watch videos without disturbing those around them.Google is also reportedly working on a 5G version of the Pixel 4, according to Nikkei Asian Review, which would see the tech giant beat its old foe Apple to releasing a next-generation device.Release date and priceWhile the date of the announcement is already known, it is not clear yet when the phones will actually be released. If past Pixel cycles are anything to go by, pre-orders will open the day of the unveiling, with the release date coming before the end of the month.Last year, the Pixel 3 was revealed on 9 October and released nine days later on 18 October.No amount of leaks have given a certain indication of the exact price of the new phones, though listings discovered by 9to5Google\u0026nbspsuggest the Pixel 4 will cost 820 euros (£727) and the Pixel 4 XL will be 1,127 euros (£999).Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The store stocks more than 100,000 LPs and CDs, and it is the first retailer to offer every film available in\u0026nbsp4K UHD, which amounts to 20,000 Blu-ray and more than\u0026nbsp40,000 DVD titles.The\u0026nbspVault, located close to the city centre, also features a performance space designed for concerts by international and local musicians. Liam Payne will perform at the store’s launch on Friday, followed by James Arthur on Saturday. The Murder Capital and local bands will play over the opening weekend.“I am a firm believer in the potential for British high street retail,” said Doug Putman, owner of HMV.“Retail offers two things a purely digital experience of music simply can’t – the opportunity to experience the biggest acts live in our stores and our ability to offer a platform to new artists in the communities where we operate, as well as opportunities for fans to come together and share their passion for music and film with our dedicated staff.”Created with Sketch.

At the time, it blamed a continued decline in the CD and DVD market, as well as “extremely weak Christmas footfall”.

Many multinational firms earn revenues in other currencies before converting them into sterling, which means their bottom lines are given a foreign exchange boost when the pound is weak.The more domestically focused FTSE 250 soared more than 3 per cent in response to the positive noises emanating from Brussels.A UK government spokesperson and an EU Commission spokesperson both separately described the morning’s meeting as “constructive”, as did Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator.“Brexit is like climbing a mountain,” Mr Barnier said. “We need vigilance, determination and patience.”A European Commission spokesperson said: “The EU and UK have agreed to intensify discussions over the coming days.\u0026nbsp“The EU’s position remains the same: there must be a legally operative solution in the withdrawal agreement that avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland, protects the all-island economy and the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement in all its dimensions, and safeguards the integrity of the single market.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He was canonised in 1976.Cardinal Newman, himself, was born in 1801, the son of a London banker, and became a Church of England cleric before converting to Roman Catholicism in 1845.He lived in Birmingham for some 40 years and, when he died aged 89, more than 15,000 people lined the city’s streets for his funeral.His path to sainthood came after he was credited with two miracles.The first came in 2001 when Jack Sullivan, an American deacon from Massachusetts, attributed his recovery from a spinal cord disorder to the intervention of Cardinal Newman whom he had prayed to.The second was in 2013 when Chicago lawyer Melissa Villalobos claimed she had prayed to the churchman after her placenta tore while she was pregnant.The 42-year-old told the The Times: “I said, ‘Please Cardinal Newman make the bleeding stop.’\u0026nbspIt stopped immediately.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The SNP leader said she would favour a “progressive type of alliance” if the Conservatives were ousted from power.She said: “But I say this to Jeremy Corbyn or any Westminster leader who’s looking to the SNP for support, if you don’t accept Scotland’s right to choose our own future at a time of our own choosing, don’t even bother picking up the phone to me.”At the conference,\u0026nbspIan Blackford, leader of the SNP in the Commons, will say that retaining the party’s majority of Scottish seats at Westminster will reaffirm the mandate to hold another referendum on Scottish independence.The latest poll indicates large gains for the SNP at the next general election, with the party on 39 per cent, up one percentage point since June.The Conservatives are also predicted to gain at 21 per cent, up three percentage points since June, while Labour are on 19 per cent, up two.The Liberal Democrats are unchanged on 13 per cent\u0026nbspand the Greens unchanged on 2 per cent, while the Brexit Party was on 5 per cent, down four percentage points since June.Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said\u0026nbspthe Conservatives face losing more than half of their Scottish seats.He calculates the SNP will win 48 seats – up from 35 at the 2017 general election – with the Scottish Tories falling from 13 to five, Labour from seven to one, and the Lib Dems rising from four to five.With additional reporting from PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Is that something that you’re prepared to accept as a price worth paying?”Boris Johnson will ‘probably not’ ask for Brexit extension – JunckerMs Patel responded: “Well, I don’t accept that, and you know, I don’t know which data you’re quoting.”Mr Marr then reminded her he was quoting the government’s own documents.Nigel Evans, a Conservative MP for Ribble Valley, has defended the home secretary.“Priti Patel and the government are fed up with ‘project fear’ stories and being hammered by journalists who are critical because a government is working tirelessly to deliver what people voted for in the 2016 referendum,” Mr Evans told the Press Association.On social media, Labour MP David Lammy responded to the interview by saying it was “unforgiveable” that Ms Patel did not know her own government’s analysis.“Priti Patel is reminded of her own government’s analysis of the disastrous impact of Boris Johnson‘s proposed Brexit, she replies ‘I don’t know which data you’re quoting,’” Mr Lammy said.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We are making a statement to the world that beautiful wild animals like bears and tigers have no place on trapeze wires or jumping through flames.”Every fashion brand that has banned fur: From Chanel to BurberryThe ban excludes fur worn for religious or tribal purposes, and used fur. It also does not apply to leather, cowhides, stuffed animals and the full skin of deer, sheep and goats, according to the SF Chronicle.\u0026nbspUnder the new law, violators could face up to $500 (£400) fines, with fines up to $1,000 for repeat violations.

Black propaganda refers in Turkish to a smear campaign.\u0026nbspThe broadside, published on Sunday, came after Mr Lammy posted his own tweet showing a video in which a Kurdish mother appears to be holding her dead child.In the minute-long footage, she says the child has been killed in Turkish shelling of the region.Created with Sketch.Turkey launches offensive into Syria Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Turkish soldiers with armored vehiclesA woman flees with her children during Turkish bombardment on Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinThe first group of Turkish infantry prepare to enter Syria on the borderSmoke billows from targets inside SyriaTurkish armoured vehicles enter Syria in AkcakaleCivilians leave as smoke rises from Ras al-AinA multi-rocket launcher fires in an unknown location People wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the borderGirls stand together in Ras al Ain townA woman walks as smoke billows following Turkish bombardment in Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinA Turkish army\u0027s tank drives down from a truck towards the border with Syria Turkish jet taxis on tarmac after returning to a military base in southeast DiyarbakirA Turkish armored vehicle drives down a road during a military operation in Kurdish areas of northern SyriaPeople sit on belongings at a back of a truck as they flee Ras al Ain townPeople wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the border into SyriaCivilians flee with their belongings Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, speaks with Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, left, as they watch the operation by Turkish forces in Kurdish areas Smoke rises from the Syrian town of Tal AbyadTurkey-backed members of Syrian National Army prepare for moving to Turkey with heavy armed vehiclesTurkish soldiers with armored vehiclesA woman flees with her children during Turkish bombardment on Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinThe first group of Turkish infantry prepare to enter Syria on the borderSmoke billows from targets inside SyriaTurkish armoured vehicles enter Syria in AkcakaleCivilians leave as smoke rises from Ras al-AinA multi-rocket launcher fires in an unknown location People wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the borderGirls stand together in Ras al Ain townA woman walks as smoke billows following Turkish bombardment in Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinA Turkish army\u0027s tank drives down from a truck towards the border with Syria Turkish jet taxis on tarmac after returning to a military base in southeast DiyarbakirA Turkish armored vehicle drives down a road during a military operation in Kurdish areas of northern SyriaPeople sit on belongings at a back of a truck as they flee Ras al Ain townPeople wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the border into SyriaCivilians flee with their belongings Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, speaks with Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, left, as they watch the operation by Turkish forces in Kurdish areas Smoke rises from the Syrian town of Tal AbyadTurkey-backed members of Syrian National Army prepare for moving to Turkey with heavy armed vehicles“The human face of Trump decision to give Turkey a free pass to attack Kurdish allies in north-eastern Syria,” Mr Lammy wrote in the post. “Heartbreaking.”But CNN Turk – which, though based in Istanbul, comes under the wider CNN umbrella – said in its own report that elements of the video were false and accused the MP of spreading lies.Responding to the piece online, many suggested that the terminology used appeared to have racial connotations.The MP\u0027s office has been contacted for comment.UK urges Turkey to halt Syria offensive How Turkey hopes to kill Kurdish self-rule with a short, cheap warUS warns Turkey it has right to self-defence in SyriaIsis militants break out of prison in Syria after bombing by TurkeyTens of thousands flee Turkish bombing in SyriaThe vacuum left by the US in Syria clears a breeding ground for Isis After The Independent contacted CNN, the tweet was removed but no reply provided.Ankara has caused international outrage with its invasion of north-eastern Syria where hundreds of thousands of Kurds have created a de facto state that has become one of the region’s few stable areas.Turkish president Recep Erdogan accuses the Kurds of being terrorists and says it wants to drive them out of a planned so-called “safe zone” reaching 30km into Syria.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Almost 200 people – many civilians – have been killed in the fighting. Some 130,000 refugees have been created, the UN has said, mostly those fleeing the bombarded towns of Ras al-Ain and Tel Abyad.Ankara accuses the Kurds of being terrorists and says it wants to drive them out of a planned so-called “safe zone” reaching 30km into Syria.Created with Sketch.Turkey launches offensive into Syria Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Turkish soldiers with armored vehiclesA woman flees with her children during Turkish bombardment on Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinThe first group of Turkish infantry prepare to enter Syria on the borderSmoke billows from targets inside SyriaTurkish armoured vehicles enter Syria in AkcakaleCivilians leave as smoke rises from Ras al-AinA multi-rocket launcher fires in an unknown location People wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the borderGirls stand together in Ras al Ain townA woman walks as smoke billows following Turkish bombardment in Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinA Turkish army\u0027s tank drives down from a truck towards the border with Syria Turkish jet taxis on tarmac after returning to a military base in southeast DiyarbakirA Turkish armored vehicle drives down a road during a military operation in Kurdish areas of northern SyriaPeople sit on belongings at a back of a truck as they flee Ras al Ain townPeople wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the border into SyriaCivilians flee with their belongings Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, speaks with Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, left, as they watch the operation by Turkish forces in Kurdish areas Smoke rises from the Syrian town of Tal AbyadTurkey-backed members of Syrian National Army prepare for moving to Turkey with heavy armed vehiclesTurkish soldiers with armored vehiclesA woman flees with her children during Turkish bombardment on Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinThe first group of Turkish infantry prepare to enter Syria on the borderSmoke billows from targets inside SyriaTurkish armoured vehicles enter Syria in AkcakaleCivilians leave as smoke rises from Ras al-AinA multi-rocket launcher fires in an unknown location People wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the borderGirls stand together in Ras al Ain townA woman walks as smoke billows following Turkish bombardment in Syria\u0027s northeastern town of Ras al-AinA Turkish army\u0027s tank drives down from a truck towards the border with Syria Turkish jet taxis on tarmac after returning to a military base in southeast DiyarbakirA Turkish armored vehicle drives down a road during a military operation in Kurdish areas of northern SyriaPeople sit on belongings at a back of a truck as they flee Ras al Ain townPeople wave as Turkish soldiers prepare to cross the border into SyriaCivilians flee with their belongings Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, right, speaks with Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, left, as they watch the operation by Turkish forces in Kurdish areas Smoke rises from the Syrian town of Tal AbyadTurkey-backed members of Syrian National Army prepare for moving to Turkey with heavy armed vehiclesIt launched its invasion on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump withdrew American troops from the region – an unexpected move widely condemned by both domestic supporters and international allies alike.Even the Turkish Republic in Northern Cyprus – a de facto state that is traditionally Turkey’s strongest supporter – called for peace and dialogue.Concerns centre around the betrayal of the Kurds,\u0026nbspone of West’s staunchest historical allies in the region,\u0026nbspand the fact that the area is home to prisons containing thousands of Isis fighters.Around 100 Isis-affiliated women and children escaped from a camp on Sunday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.How Turkey hopes to kill Kurdish self-rule with a short, cheap warUS warns Turkey it has right to self-defence in SyriaIsis militants break out of prison in Syria after bombing by TurkeyTens of thousands flee Turkish bombing in SyriaThe vacuum left by the US in Syria clears a breeding ground for Isis Isis fighters break out of north Syria jail amid fightingThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces has said it cannot continue guarding these detainees if it also has to fight the Turkish army – meaning the release of countless terrorists into the already devastated region.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the last three-and-a-half years, the opposite has ­occurred.It has been the British people — calm, patient, amazingly good-humoured — who have set the example to the foaming fools of our political class. It has been the elite that has been rioting and generally behaving like hooligans.Has there ever been a wilder time in the corridors of power, here and abroad  In the House of Commons we have had sit-ins and choruses of communism’s Red Flag anthem.Middle-class vegan eco-warriors — few of them seemingly poor enough to have to earn a living — have set up tents in Trafalgar Square and Whitehall and brought traffic chaos to working Londoners.Top civil servants and privy councillors have almost come to blows. And a prince of the realm and his new we have thrown a massive wobbly about their Press coverage, mere days after most newspapers had showered them in positive publicity.The clincher for me was Piers Morgan’s rivetingly bizarre ITV interview this week with Boris Johnson’s ex-crumpetJenner Arcuri.Here was a network breakfast TV show quizzing a dimpled dolly-bird in Los Angeles for the best part of an hour, feverishly trying to find outshe had had nookie with our Prime Minister.Up and down the country, families were trying to get some cornflakes into the kids before school, while listening to a blonde with a dirty laugh fight off persistent questions about whether or not she had been “intimate” with the head of our country’s government.Look, I’m no vicar. I don’t really care about politicians’ sex lives, though I happen to think people are happier — and lawmakers more trustworthy —they obey their wedding vows. I also thought Morgan did pretty well in the interview. But it was just such a vivid demonstration of the cartoon-ishness of our current predicament.Cartoon seems the right word because so much of what has been happening in British public le has been farcical and obvious to the point of caricature. Look at the behaviour of the Commons Speaker, John Bercow. His self-conduct in the chair of the Commons has been so maniacally biased, it really does belong to an episode of The Simpsons.Bercow has screamed abuse at MPs who have dared criticise him. He has ripped up centuries of procedural custom to bend the rules to the advantage of his Remain-backing friends. One of his family cars even sported a “Bollocks to Brexit” sticker.If someone tried to chair a parish council in such a blatantly preachy, lecturing way, they would be fired before the first item of business had been completed. Yet Bercow, who will finally quit his role at the end of this month, is going to walk into a six-figure pension for the rest of his le — and he is only .The recent party conferences saw ripe behaviour from our political class. The Liberal Democrats passed a motion vowing to ignore the result of our country’s largest ever public vote. Er, how is that “democratic” At Labour’s conference, the apparent result of a key vote was overturned on the blatant say-so of one of Comrade Corbyn’s key commissars. They didn’t bother to have any votes at the Tory con­ference — they never do — but we did have the spectacle of a parliamentary knight of the shires being kicked out of the premises after an alleged contretemps with a doorkeeper.And you should have seen the amount of booze being put away at those party conferences and at the TUC’s shindig a week earlier. Great lakes of alcohol were gulped down, much of it free. This from the same political class that loves to lecture the rest of us about watching our weekly units.Things are not much better where in our body politic. Top judge Lady Hale has been revelling in her notoriety after she and her fellow Supreme Court judges changed the law and thus made Brexit less likely.Judges once kept themselves away from the media fray. Hale, making jokes at Boris Johnson’s expense and giving quite unnecessary self-promotional interviews, has looked swollen-headed and has done nothing to allay fears the judiciary is as bent as Bercow.The police’s reputation is also in the mire after the mishandling of some plainly absurd sex-abuse allegations. The only other person who believed them was Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who is now bleating about the dangers of a No-Deal Brexit.Why should we believe a single word he says  Talking of the police, why are the Met so timid about stopping the Extinction Rebellion protests in London  You can bet thatthose protestors had been massing in favour of a No-Deal Brexit, they’d have been baton-charged and loaded into the back of a Black Maria. And the public’s response to all this  You have, ladies and gentlemen, been magnicent.You have not rioted. You have not risen up in fury. You have found it hard to stomach, I know, but you have kept your humour. You have stayed loyal to democracy, voting in the European elections we were never meant to have.Opinion polls suggest that Euroscepticism is only growing, with more now wanting a No-Deal Brexit than not.You have, in short, shown the poise and maturity we once expected from our political masters.

Especially since Brussels’ absurd ultimatum that the UK and or Northern Ireland must remain in its customs union for ever is a non-starter.But The Sun still hopes a deal can be struck. Because the uncertainty is damaging the economy, crippling firms and causing stress to families everywhere.And the newly ferocious recriminations, like the EU’s Guy Verhofstadt idiotically branding Brexiteers “traitors”, threaten to wreck relations between us for years. A deal or, failing that, a clean break, are the only ways to resolve both.Yet the new Remainer clamour for a second referendum, championed by Labour and the Lib Dems, is as deafening as it is reckless and myopic.Can they not see how it would tear Britain apart  Do they really want months, even years, more ision and political paralysis — with Parliament’s reputation destroyed for good Are they really so clueless as to believe the Remain victory they crave would solve anything Are they that deaf to a public desperate to get Brexit done AMERICA is guilty both of hypocrisy and an abdication of responsibility over death-crash driver Anne Sacoolas.Its government got diplomatic immunity lted when a foreign envoy killed a teenage US resident in Washington.

Unless you live under a rock, you will have been as gripped as the rest of us by Coleen’s very public suggestion that Rebekah has sold stories about Coleen’s personal le “for a few years now”.“After a long time of trying to ­figure out who it could be,” Coleen wrote on Instagram, “for ious reasons I had a ­suspicion. To try and prove this I came up with an idea.”That meant blocking all of her followers except one on her private Instagram account, then posting fake stories to seethey made it into the papers.“The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about ing to TV and the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house,” she wrote, were all .So when the stories appeared in print, Coleen pounced. “Now I know for certain which account inidual it’s come from. It’s . . . Rebekah Vardy’s account.”Rebekah denies being the ­source of the stories, claiming a string of other people have had access to her Instagram account. Call me old-fashioned, but why didn’t Coleen pick up the phone instead of picking a public fight Coleen assumed this saga would grab the world’s attention. It has, but perhaps not for the reasons she thought.It gives us a real insight into the reality of fame and the ­obsessive paranoia that can go with it.Although she is used to living out her ­personal dramas in the public eye, Coleen has ­forgotten that public spats, especially those waged on social media, never end well.All too often, they reflect badly on BOTH parties. And they can lead to a social media pile-on that seriously affects people’s lives.Rebekah cut short her ­holiday this week and has had to contend with some truly vile trolling about her children and even her unborn baby.Meanwhile, what Coleen has failed to grasp is this: Something is only a secretyou are the only person who knows about it.The moment you share your secrets on social media — even in a “private” group — you risk those secrets escaping into the real world.You know, the real world, where friends meet up for a glass of wine and a long chat, talking about their lives rather than sharing edited highlights via social media.That is what friends are for. I couldn’t survive without my friends and would far rather chat to them than post on social media.If you suspect someone is stealing your secrets and selling them on, wouldn’t any right-thinking person simply cut them out of their le Why bother laying an elaborate trap to catch the culpritthe main objective is to stop it happening and get negative people away from you To me, it feels very teenagerish, the sort of thing you do in school, not when you are a grown woman with four kids.The s Coleen went to ­suggest she has a bit too much time on her hands.Perhaps this is a by-product of an obsession with your privacy — when you want it, that is, and not when you are selling your wedding photos to glossy celebrity magazines.You develop such a high opinion of yourself that you truly believe the world and his we are on ­tenterhooks about the latest minutiae of your domestic le.This story highlights something : The impact fame can have on someone’s ego and their sense of their own importance.  Really, Coleen just needs to get over herself.WE desperately need to do something about one in three primary school kids being dangerously fat – double the rate of  years ago.But banning consumption of all food and drink on public transport – as well as pies at football matches – would be scratching the wrong itch.Isn’t the real answer to educate people about healthy eating and stop companies marketing sugary foods to children  Alongside spending more time and money promoting sport so kids move more and eat less Don’t get me wrong, I object to people eating food on the Tube. But that has nothing to do with weight . . . and everything to do with how off-putting it is to sit next to someone scoffing a stinking kebab.It is pretty straightforward to work outsomeone wants to have sex with you. And more importantly, when they don’t.Both my kids know how to respect others, as well as themselves. They learned it well before they got to uni.If you need to do this course when you start at university, it might already be too late.THE issue of kne crime in the capital was brought closer to home than ever for me when a schoolboy was stabbed at .pm in Stratford, East London.The attack took place in broad daylight, just after school ended, on West Ham’s doorstep.Just like that, another le was snuffed out and a family devastated.We must finally make this a priority before yet more children die needlessly.What will her one-year-old twins Leo and Lenon thinkthey read that in years to come  Maybe they will assume she was joking.Each of my two kids thinks I prefer the other one. At times, I prefer the dog!HUGE congratulations to Natalie Imbruglia, who has welcomed her first baby – a little boy she has called Max Valentine – at the age of  after conceiving with the help of a sperm donor.Good for her. She hasn’t just settled for any old man but wanted to become a mother so has done it herself. Much respect. A baby born to a mother who is single by choice could hardly be more wanted or more loved.Both Natalie and her baby will be happier without the wrong husband or father being on the scene.Meanwhile, Naomi Campbell has said she is “not yet” ready to become a mother at the age of .

It wasn’t so long ago the EU ruled out EVER re-opening the negotiations and Britain was hurtling towards a No Deal crash. What made the dference  Could it be that our friends in Brussels were riled at the idea of Boris fighting an election while blaming them for Britain not getting out on time Things started to change on Tuesday when a No source briefed details of a call between the PM and Germany’s Angela Merkel. The insider’s memo said their conversation made it clear a deal was “overwhelmingly unlikely”.Bearing all the hallmarks of Boris Johnson’s de facto chief of staff Dominic Cummings, it was texted to James Forsyth, Sun columnist and Political Editor of The Spectator. In chilling tones, it raised fears Boris was heading flat out for No Deal.It threatened: “Supporting delay will be seen by this Government as hostile interference in domestic politics. Any delay will be negotiated between you, Parliament and the courts. We will focus on winning the election on a manesto of immediately revoking the entire EU legal order without further talks, and then we will leave.”Feathers were ruffled across the Channel — yet within two days Boris and Irish Taoiseach Varadkar agreed to meet then said they could “see a pathway” to Brexit deal. EU Council President Donald Tusk had earlier made clear his anger at the original briefing, tweeting at the PM: “What’s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.”Outrage aside, Tusk is a seasoned politician and is wise enough to know a general election is coming. Evenhe asked for a humiliating extension, Boris could come back with a majority and a strengthened mandate to take the country to No Dealnecessary.It would have given the EU a reason to pause. Did they really want to take such a big risk and damage relations with the UK, especiallyBoris was going towith No Deal in his manesto  Boris has blustered his way through the critics, promising to “get Brexit done” despite the odds ening every day.At times it has all looked a bit desperate. But the UK doesn’t hold all the cards. To get a deal through, Boris needs the Irish government to compromise too. Varadkar’s stubbornness was a sticking point. Ireland’s leader, like everyone , knows Theresa May’s deal was not supported in Parliament.Showing no signs of movement on the issue would make the Irish just as culpable of creating a hard border as those in Westminster. This hardline briefing is not how any of us want to deal with our friends and allies in Europe. But the brinkmanship looks like it has produced results.We are not out of the woods by any means. At this moment, we are still not clear on any details of the new proposals. So you can see why No kept up the pressure on No Deal, why Chancellor Sajid Javid committed to spending more than £billion to get the Government ready to go and why Michael Gove is working on plans to put all that spending in place.For all the worry about No Deal, keeping it on the table was a necessary step to strengthen our position. Claims the Government was looking for a legal loophole to remove the obstacles now appear fancul.But the EU would have taken note and would have worried about stubbornly sticking to its positionthe threat of No Deal suddenly reappeared. If we are serious about a deal, No should end the hardline rhetoric. The EU will not make this easy. And why should they  But their cautious welcome of the breakthrough with Ireland means we have reasons to be cheerful.Now is the time for cool heads and for Boris to engage in a statesmanlike way. He needs to get to grips with the detail of exactly how we can make an alternative to the backstop work. Sadly, that’s not even the hard part.Any deal will need to come back to Parliament, where tribal loyalties, political positioning and genuine anger have intensied in recent months. There is almost no chance opposition parties will back anything that comes back from Brussels.So the only way to deliver Brexit is to bring together the fractious parts of the Conservative Party, the breakaway Tory rebel MPs and the hardcore Brexit “Spartans”.There is hope this can be done. The rebels will want to avoid a No Deal exit, which any deal would prevent, and the Spartans have started to see that leaving in an orderly way may be the only chance they have to get us out.The alternative could be more months of delay, ending in a second referendum. None of which they could possibly want. And there is one other group to win over, the dangerously dficult DUP.They are critical to parliamentary success. So far, they have stayed tight-lipped about the latest developments, only reiterating their original position of leaving with the rest of the UK.He needs to get Brexit done so he can start repairing the damage getting us here has created. There are  hours until the next EU meeting, when the fate of the country will be decided. Let’s make them count. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Funding cuts and teacher shortages are pushing schools to ever larger class sizes.“Those who say that the quality of education can be maintained in such huge classes are mistaken. In some circumstances this can be made to work, but for young children personal attention is vital and they can get lost in large classes.Private schools are so attractive to parents because of their class sizes, which are about  or  children to a teacher.”A spokesperson said: Schools are funded per pupil, so the more kids you have got in a school, the more money you get.We urgently need immediate financial relief for the schools in the worst financial situations so that they don’t have to consider super-size classes just to make ends meet.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I think that he is somebody who even the arch Eurosceptics, even a member of the Brexit Party, can trust and have confidence in, he told Sky Newsaposs Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme. His comments will be seen as a sign of nervousness that hardline Tory Brexiteers could scupper any agreement Mr Johnson is able to reach, just as they thwarted his predecessor.    The Prime Minister was briefing the Cabinet on the progress of the negotiations - which were continuing over the weekend with UK and EU in Brussels - in a conference call. It comes after the DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds fired a warning shot to ministers that anyto Mrs Mayaposs plan to resolve the issue of the Irish border would not be acceptable to his party. Reports from Brussels suggested the Prime Minister had sought to revive a proposal by Mrs May for Northern Ireland to remain politically in a customs union with the EU, but it would be administered by the UK. The plan would avoid the need for customs controls on the island of Ireland - something the EU is adamantly opposed to. However, Mr Dodds - whose partyaposs votes may be essentiala deal is to get through Parliament - told the Italian La Repubblica newspaper that Northern Ireland must stay in a full UK customs union, full stop. It cannot work because Northern Ireland has to remain fully part of the UK customs union, he said.    Mr Rees-Mogg refused to be drawn on the detail of what was being discussed in the Belgian capital. Naturally in the middle of a negotiation these matters are extremely sensitive as everyone is compromising to some degree and therefore to give negotiations the best chance of succeeding, it is best to be discreet about them, he said. But pressed on whether it could be close to Mrs Mayaposs plan, he said: Weaposll have to find out in a day or two whether Iaposll have to eat my words or not - time will tell. He added: Thereaposs a line from Churchill saying that he often had to eat his words and he found it to be a very nourishing diet - and that is something that happens in  politics . Meanwhile, Home Secretary Priti Patel said security measures were being stepped up in preparedness for a possible no-deal, but denied they were driven by fears of an upsurge in terrorism by dissident Irish republicans. She acknowledged however they were conscious of the situation in Northern Ireland and said ministers were working on alternative arrangements for intelligence and data sharing. When it comes to security tools and security co-operation there are many measures that are being put in place right now in preparedness for no-deal, she told BBCaposs The Andrew Marr Show.

They now live on the side of a clf in Cornwall with a bunch of pigs, ducks and chickens and a static caravan.Five years ago, the family lived in a little house in south east London, but Davina found herself idly scrolling through Cornish properties. She said: “My son was nine at the time and we were starting to look at secondaries and thinking about the future and the post office in Grampound came up for sale. “My other half is a builder and I was a photographer and we thought we’d buy it and convert it. “We fell in love with the idea, put our house on the market, our offer was accepted and our house went up for sale like that.”  The family, Davina, now , her partner Todd and their children Michael, , Saffron, , Ruby, , and Harry,  months, were disappointed and left stumped when their offer for the post office was not accepted. But their own house in London had been sold, so the decided to move anyway. They rented a small house in Perranporth, started the children,  in schools and ended up buying a derelict old miners’ cottage in Redruth, which Todd worked on renovating while Davina, who had been a professional photographer in London, worked in Spar and the Cornish Pizza Co. She added: We had all these bills and all this pressure,” she said. “It was not my ambition from being a successful photographer in London to working in a supermarket. And we were beginning to get burnt out by the property thing. Todd and I were used to camping - we met working at festivals - so we rented out the house in Redruth and started to look for land.”  Eventually, the familyaposs dream plot of land, a seven and three quarter acre agricultural plot became available and they purchased it. The sale went through and they got four Cornish black pigs and some chickens and started working the land right away. Davina said: “We rented locally for that time and we were going up there every day working the land. It was just a completely empty field. We had to drag containers of water up the hill. On one day our pig arc blew off the clf and I had to climb down and drag it back up. We had no income and we were investing in the land.”  But the work was expensive and in a few months they were forced to stop renting and move onto the land. The mother-of-four said: “We had a horsebox and a shack Todd built out of some pallets and the bell tent. We had some ducks and some geeses. “We decided to do  days camping because that’s allowed in the scope of the land. Everyone loved it, we got some great reviews. “But I fell pregnant over that summer and I was sick every single day and all night. I got insomnia, so I didn’t sleep. It was so cold and wet. It just rained and rained. “And then we went into winter and it was brutal and then in March the Beast from the East came and I swear to god I had snow on the end of my bed and I was eight months pregnant.”     In sub zero temperatures, the family’s generator broke, they had no heating, one car battery and a broken solar  for power and were effectively just about existing through one of the most brutal winters in history.But the family did not let the weather beat them and persevered, buying two static caravans at the end of March  and moving to a more sheltered part of the field.The -year-old said: Harry decided to come a week early. I was painting the caravans and my waters broke That was last April. We didn’t do camping that year. We were stretched to breaking point.

Lindsay Dutton is fighting to keep her daughter Lucy in the UK after the Home Office gave her  days to leave the country. Lucyaposs child visitor visa expired in February and her mum was told to apply for the right to remain, but the Home Office rejected the application because the two-year-old has not lived continuously in Britain for seven years. The toddler does not have an automatic right to stay in the UK as both of her parents were born abroad. Heartbroken Ms Dutton, originally from South Africa and now living in Swansea, has been left in tears over the inhumane decision and has launched a campaign to cover the £, appeal.    The -year-old mum told the Sunday Express: Itaposs against human rights what they are doing to us. Itaposs cruel. Itaposs heartbreaking to do that to a parent, all I have done the entire week is sob. I have broken down in the last few days, I do not know where to turn. The Home Office sent a letter to Lucy denying her claim because the girl has not lived continuously in the UK for at least seven years, the BBC reported. The letter claimed Johannesburg-born Lucy failed to provide evidence of a familial link between yourself and these alleged relatives.  It said she had the right to appeal the decision, but must leave the UK within  daysshe does not. The letter suggest Lucyto South Africa with her parents - arguing they would be able to find work there - Ms Dutton, a tenant liaison officer, settled in South Wales in August  after coming to the UK for a visit. She has since separated from Lucyaposs father, Gavin Burls, , who now lives in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, the Sunday Express reported. Neither was born in the UK but both claimed British citizenship through their parents. Lucy cannot claim citizenship through her parents or grandparents, and her mum claims she has no family members in her native South Africa.

But they took her back to the emergency ward after she developed a terrible rash across her legs and doctoraposs diagnosed her with meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia.Aimee was eventually told by doctors Brogan-Lei needed to have her feet and then both of her legs amputated after contracting septacemia, Birmingham Live reports   The mum-of-four said: Weaposd just came back from a family break when she contracted Meningitis B, Brogan-Lei was only seven at the time. She did not seem herself. She’d had a sleepless night and was vomiting. We took her to AE but they sent us home, saying she only had a tummy bug.

Although, her mum pleaded with doctors for them to find another way to save her child she was told that it was a le or death situation and Brogan needed to lose her left foot.  We’re so lucky that she was saved but we were devastated when Brogan had to have her left foot amputated due to the septicaemia. The damage was done within just a few hours, but only time will tell how much the disease will affect her le. We were later told told she will need to have her right foot amputated too. When we first found out she was going to lose her legs, we thought there was absolutely no way that could happen. I didnapost want my little girl to lose her legs but it was the only option. Four years on and brave Brogan, now aged , is working on rebuilding her le and becoming independent once again. Her mum praised her for her positive attitude towards everything le has thrown at her. She said: She was completely oblivious to it all because she was so heavily medicated at the time. Her education suffered because of it. But now sheaposs , sheaposs adjusted to everything really well. Sheaposs always had a good mindset and is determined to get her full independence back. Mrs Partridge added she wants to urge parents to be more aware of the symptoms of the potentially deadly condition, as little Brogan tries to reclaim her independence.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA US spyaposs we involved in a crash that killed British teenager Harry Dunn does not have diplomatic immunity, the Foreign Office says. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab wrote a letter to Harryaposs parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, explaining that suspect Anne Sacoolas, , does not have the right since leaving the UK. Mrs Sacoolas - married to a US intelligence official - flew home and claimed immunity after Harry, , died when his motorbike and her Volvo SUV collided outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on August . Harryaposs parents were flying to the US on Sunday in a desperate bid to meet with Mrs Sacoolas and hear her explain what happened, as British police said they are absolutely committed to getting Harry and his family justice. A lawyer representing the British couple claims they arenapost interested in a criminal case and says they could sue Mrs Sacoolas in a US courttheir questions arenapost answered.    Lawyers representing Harryaposs parents and Mrs Sacoolas - who is said to be devastated - are due to meet to discuss the case at the earliest opportunity in the US. After hearing that Mrs Sacoolas wants to apologise, Mrs Charles, , told Sky News that she wants to meet the suspect, but sorry just doesnapost cut it and thataposs not really quite enough. Amid confusion over the American womanaposs status in the UK, solicitor Mark Stephens, who represents Mrs Charles and Mr Dunn, , said Mrs Sacoolas wasnapost covered by diplomatic immunity in Britain because her husband hadnapost applied for it through the proper channel. Mr Stephens said Mrs Sacoolasapos -year-old son was with her when her SUV and Harryaposs motorbike collided. Her husband Jonathan worked at the base, used by US spy personnel.    Mr Stephens told Sky News on Sunday morning: She wasn’t entitled to diplomatic immunity in the first place. She was spirited away on a USAFtransport plane back to America, effectively rendering her a fugitive from British justice. Somebody advised her to do that, it was very ill advised. Evenshe were entitled to diplomatic immunity it only applies in the host country, so the UK. It does not apply in your home country, so she is liable … in her home country. That means the Dunn family can sue her in the United States for the explanation that they need to psychologically get closure on the first part of their grieving process and move on with the grieving process.  Mrs Sacoolas is the spouse of a US diplomat assigned to the UK, according to the US State Department. The case took a twist on Saturday when it emerged Mr Raab had sent a letter to Harryaposs parents saying that immunity, and therefore any question of waiver, is no longer relevant in Mrs Sacoolasapos case, because she has ed home. He wrote: The US have now informed us that they too consider that immunity is no longer pertinent. In these circumstances, Harryaposs case is now a matter for Northants police and the CPS to take forward. He added: We have pressed strongly for a waiver of immunity, so that justice can be done ... Whilst the US government has steadfastly declined to give that waiver, that is not the end of the matter.  We have looked at this very carefully ... the UK governmentaposs position is that immunity, and therefore any question of waiver, is no longer relevant in Mrs Sacoolasapos case, because she has ed home. Mr Dunn, Harryaposs grief-stricken father, told Sky News that the letter was excellent news, adding: As weaposve said all along, we believed she didnapost have immunity and we always believed it was just incorrect. This means so much to us. The dad comforted his dying son on the roadside after a friend in the fire service had informed him about the crash. Home Secretary Priti Patel told the BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show that it was right that co-operation takes place. She said: It is right that justice is served, that an investigation takes place, and that Anne Sacoolas actually does co-operate with investigation. Mrs Sacoolasapos Volvo XC was travelling on the wrong side of the road when it collided with Harry, a petrol station cashier, as he rode his motorcycle in the small village of Croughton, where the RAF base is used by American intelligence personnel.  A new keep left sign and road markings - arrows indicating the direction of travel - have since appeared close to the crash site. Prosecutors have not said whether they would pursue charges. Last week, Chief Constable Nick Adderley said Northamptonshire Police would treat Mrs Sacoolas like any other person wanted for questioning. The force was told after meeting with Mrs Sacoolas on August  that diplomatic immunity applied, therefore preventing officers from progressing with an investigation. Northamptonshire Police has said it is determined to fully investigate the crash even though the driver of the car is no longer in the UK, and is working closely with the Crown Prosecution Service and Foreign Office. Superintendent Sarah Johnson said in a statement on Sunday: Northamptonshire Police remains absolutely committed to getting Harry and his family justice and we are doing everything on our side to ensure that a full and thorough investigation, with the assistance of all parties involved, takes place, in order for this to be achieved. After raising the possibility of a civil case in a US court, Mr Stephens, Harryaposs familyaposs spokesman and lawyer said it was “less clear” whether there would be a criminal case in the UK.  He said: “Normally, Northamptonshire Police would put a case together, charge her and she would have said ‘I have diplomatic immunity’ and a court would have ruled. “In this case, quite unusually, she was spirited out of the country beyond the reaches of the British justice system, so they couldn’t rule on whether she had diplomatic immunity.” The drama has caused “untold additional grief and hurt” for Harryaposs family, according to the lawyer, who said it is hoped Mrs Sacoolas willto the UK and submits to british justice, despite later adding that the family arenapost interested in the criminal side. After the crash, Mrs Sacoolas and her family were flown out of the UK on a private flight that took off from RAF Mildenhall, Suffolk. He said: The most important thing for the Dunn family is not really whether she is prosecuted or not. They need to see her, they need to talk to her about the last moments of their son’s le so they can get closure. If she doesn’t give an explanation to them they could sue her in a US court to get one, he added.  Mr Stephens said Mrs Sacoolasapos -year-old son was in the front passenger seat of her Volvo when the fatal collision happened, and it was no doubt a traumatic experience for the boy and tragic for her family. Mrs Sacoolasapos legal team has said she wanted to meet Harryaposs parents to express her deepest sympathies and apologies. Her legal representative, Amy Jeffress, said: Anne is devastated by this tragic accident. No loss compares to the death of a child and Anne extends her deepest sympathy to Harry Dunnaposs family. Harryaposs familyaposs spokesman, Radd Seiger, said he had spoken with Ms Jeffress and the pair had agreed to get together asap ... to discuss how we are going to achieve a solution. He told NBC News: I have had a brief conversation with the legal representatives appointed on behalf of Anne Sacoolas and we have agreed to meet at the earliest opportunity.

Helen France, , from Rotherham, claims her dream Spanish property in Alicante became a living nightmare when she got her property back from squatters to discover extensive damage. The home owner claims she initially lost £, on unpaid rent and bills, solicitors fees and damage to her property. However, she says that since her house was ed, her debts have grown.    Ms France said that the tenants from hell entered her home last year, but have now left. But the extent of damage means the single mum-of-one may have to lose the property completely destroying her dreams of one day moving there permanently. She purchased the property in the Orihuela province in the Spanish resort in December , initially using it as a holiday home before she decided to let it out in January  to save enough money to enable her to move there permanently. She purchased the home abroad with her le savings and intended it to be a place of solace and eventually inheritance to gt to her daughter Hope, . However, the mum claims her dreams have turned to dust after the tenants destroyed her home - throwing furniture out of windows, breaking walls and flooring and accumulating unpaid electricity bills of more than  euros per month.    Ms France moved to Alicante full-time in December last year and assumed she could move into the property, but claims months of eviction notices went ignored and she claims physical threats were made against her. They threatened to kill me, even leaving a kne wedged in the sofa with a threat on my le, she said. The entire situation has left me beyond heartbroken - the house isnapost even habitable at the moment. Iaposve always been independent but this situation - itaposs truly brought me to my knees. I was a trusting person, but I lost everything. I was even put on medication as I was anxious, battling depression, all whilst trying to live the dream Iaposd saved up for for so long. The single mum said that her lawyer and letting agent have reach dead ends against Spanish law because of its protection for tenants, which has left her no option but to put the eviction notice through the courts at her own expense.   Ms Franceaposs friends have banded together to help her fix the property, but the damage is so severe that they launched a GoFundMe funraising page to gather the needed funds.She said: This has been a nightmare and itaposs taken a physical toll on me. I poured all I had into the property, and itaposs only now Iaposve realised that here in Spain, the tenantsapos rights outweigh the homeowneraposs. When the letting agency first approached me with these tenants, they seemed like good, ordinary people. I requested that there should be no pets, yet the next thing I knew there were animals in there and my furniture had been tipped outside onto the balcony. When I arrived in early December, they said, aposwe murder youapos and threw a brick from the roof at us.I was told I had to pay the bills from my account because itaposs in my name - but theyaposre not even paying the rent and I canapost afford to keep paying for the bills for the property when Iaposm getting nothing in . Since coming out here to Spain, Iaposm literally living hand to mouth. Itaposs like living a nightmare, I feel so alone - I donapost feel in control in any way. Iaposve been to the police, and to the letting agency but it seems no-one knows what to do. The tenants have had an eviction notice, and thataposs it.

Broadclyst Community Primary School, in Exter Devon, which has an average class size of , has built a lecture-theatre style room to accommodate its bumper class. Several schools who have tight budgets are packing pupils into classrooms, according to a new investigation. A school receives between £, and £, a year for each of the kids it teaches.Figures sourced by the Sunday Times reveal more than , primary pupils were taught in “super-size classes” averaging more than  children last year.This compared to , five years earlier, official data found.  Schools with super-size classes have come under fire from critics but Broadclystaposs headteacher Jonathan Bishop said the school - rated outstanding by Ofsted - offers an excellent education.  “I do not think  is a magic number to get better-quality education. It is not class size that dictates the quality of education, he said. Our year  classroom has got  children in one room. There are times when one teacher teaches those  children. Is that wrong  Of course it is not wrong. Our year  classroom is designed like a lecture theatre: I can seat  children in there. I know I will be public enemy No  by saying this.” Broadclyst Community Primary School  uses vast amounts of technology in its classrooms. There are multiple interactive screens for teaching, and each child has their own tablet and a digital pen at their allocated seat. Ceiling are also dotted with speakers to give an immersive surround sound.  Whataposs more regular video blogs keep parents updated along with parent apps, virtual tours are offered of the school. School meetings are broadcasted live and traditional parents’ evenings can also be conducted online via a live link with teachers for those parents who can’t make it into school.But Mr Bishop told Devon Live last year that the aposschool is using technology as a tool rather than a replacement for its traditional teaching and learningapos.He said: “In my  years here we have always endeavoured to embrace the latest technologies and to use them as a tool to support both teaching and learning.  “Therefore, we have always been at the cutting edge of not just embedding some of the latest technology into school but utilising it within their learning. “We have never seen it as a replacement for teachers or other learning tools because technology is not the answer to everything. Reading, writing and mathematics are core skills that are needed to unlock the wider curriculum.

Forecasters said Hagibis, Japanaposs worst typhoon for  years, is set to impact weather , miles away in Scotland by making the rain and wind even worse, creating new flood fears. Hagibisapos effects are expected in the second half of the week, said forecaster John Hammond of weathertrending, after the Met Office issued a rain warning for much of England.Dramatic weather maps show high-altitude Atlantic jet stream winds steering stormy low-pressure systems to Scotland, with more than two inches of rain expected for many this week.    The Met Office is predicting showers on Monday and a drier day on Tuesday before intense rain bursts and gale-force gusts up to mph from Wednesday, with rain and wind lasting into the weekend. Forecaster Michael Fish, of Netweather, said: Itaposs rain, rain and yet more rain. Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna added: Some of Typhoon Hagibisapos energy might well get caught up in North Atlantic weather and could develop low pressure areas close to the UK. Hagibis killed at least  people in Japan as it tore apart homes, caused widespread flooding by dumping almost ins of rain in just  hours, and triggered landslides.    Met Office Science tweeted: By affecting the jet stream, Hagibis could influence UK weather in the next week. Hagibisapos warm air contrasting with a cold front will accelerate the jet stream by mph. Disturbances on the other side of the world can influence UK weather. Mr Hammond said: Hagibis may well have a knock-on effect on our weather. The upshot may be rain-bearing fronts lodged across the UK as we end the week.    Hagibisapos remnants are tearing across the north Pacic in the direction of Alaska, punching into high northern latitudes. This may cause larger jet stream peaks and troughs downstream, stalling the progress of weather systems across Britain. There are fresh fears of flooding given this weekaposs forecast. Met Office forecaster Grahame Madge said: After recent rain, there is the risk of flooding from further rain.  A brief drier interlude on Tuesday is followed by Wednesday and Thursday seeing intense showers in the West, with mph gusts possible locally from Wednesday to Friday on coasts. More low pressure is forecast on Friday and the unsettled pattern expected to continue into the weekend.The Met Office has issued a severe weather warning with more than two inches of rain expected to fall in just  hours on Monday from pm.The yellow warning covers much of England - including London, Birmingham and Manchester - extending from the southern coast of Devon up to Yorkshire.  The Met Office said: Rain is expected to move northwards across much of England on Monday, heavy at times, especially during the afternoon and evening.  to mm is likely to fall quite widely, and there is potential for  to mm to fall in a few places. This brings a risk of flooding and disruption, but the situation is uncertain such that the likelihood of this across any given county is small. The rain is expected to clear away northeastwards during Monday evening and night. The Environment Agency had already issued one flood warning and  flood alerts following days of downpours.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailService stations are popular for people working late hours such as tradesmen and nurses. There are many petrol stations that only offer foods for people on the go like basic snacks and convenience foods, such as crisps, chocolate bars, fizzy drinks and pre-packaged sandwiches. And Surrey Live reporter Laura Nightingale found out it was impossible to rely on them as a source for healthy and cheap food. How much I spent I forked out a whopping £.  and that was me trying to be as frugal as possible. I made the most of the humble loaf of bread in every way possible, living off mainly homemade jam sandwiches, eggs on toast and baked beans on toast. I limited the amount of chocolate bars and packets of crisps as best I could in favour of food that would fill me up for longer - and that was cheaper.  Plus, rather than popping to the petrol station every day to grab a pre-packaged sandwich at lunch, I did the best part of my weekly shop ahead of starting the experiment so that I could plan what I would eat each day in a bid to save more money and reduce impulse buying. My chosen petrol station was the central Shell garage along the busy Ladymead in  Guildford , and it was as basic as you get. I picked this spot because it is heavily used by commuters, located just off the A slip road, and it has no mini supermarket attached to it making my experiment that bit harder. What was I letting myself in for   Healthy eating As a keen runner who likes to get her five a day, I enjoy living a healthy lestyle, but I struggled with what was on offer as there was a very limited amount of fruit and vegetables on sale. The only veg available was plastic packets of chopped carrots with hummus and a spinach and egg pot - there wasnapost even tinned veggies to rely on. Thankfully there were loose bananas and mini pots of grapes , so at least I could get some fruit into my diet. I improvised, making the best of what was available at the best price I could and of course, trying to eat as healthily as possible at the same time. This is what I ate in one week. Monday Breakfast  - Quaker Oat So Simple porridge pot made with milk and  banana Lunch  - Cream of tomato soup with two slices of bread Dinner  - Sweet chilli and ginger salmon salad Snacks  - McCoyaposs crisps, egg and spinach pot, Kelloggaposs Rice Crispies Squares bar Conclusion:  The week started off well with a breakfast and lunch I would normally eat anyway, so far so good. However the salmon salad was very dissapointing. It was quite tasty but the portion size was so tiny, it was gone within a couple of minutes and it wasnapost worth the £. price tag. As a result I still had the munchies after dinner so I snacked on crisps and a cereal bar making my planned healthy dinner a somewhat unhealthy one. Tuesday Breakfast  -  pains au chocolats Lunch  - Sweet potato falafal, houmous and veg sticks Dinner  - Baked beans on toast Snacks  - Red grapes, roasted and salted cashews,  Tunnockaposs Tea Cakes Conclusion:   The nuts were on offer for £ a pot which I thought was pretty good value for a petrol station, plus I knew they would be a filling snack option. I really enjoyed todayaposs food. The pains au chocolats were lovely warmed up in the microwave and the beans on toast was hearty and comforting - perfect for a wet and windy day. In fact, I forgot how much I loved beans on toast. However, my lunch was very small as they were snack pots, so I had nuts and grapes to follow. Rather than spending around p on a chocolate bar when I fancied something sweet, I bought a pack of Tunnockaposs Tea Cakes at the bargain price of £. for six. These also helped satisfy my cravings when I was watching the  Great British Bake Off on TV.    Wednesday Breakfast  - Quaker Oat So Simple porridge pot made with milk and  banana Lunch  - Jam sandwich, houmous and veg sticks Dinner  - Scrambled eggs on toast Snacks  - Red grapes,  Tunnockaposs Tea Cakes Conclusion:  Rather than grabbing a pre-made sandwich I saved some pennies by making my own jam sarnie. I loved them as a kid and I still love them now. For dinner I made scrambled eggs on toast but it lacked one key ingredient - butter. Dry toast is boring and unfortunately as there was no butter available at the petrol station I had to go without which wasnapost the same. My scrambled eggs could have also done with a sprinkling of salt and pepper for extra taste. Or is that me being fussy   Thursday Breakfast  -  pains au chocolats Lunch  - Jam sandwich, houmous and veg sticks Dinner  - Chicken and bacon flatbread Snacks  -  banana, roasted and salted cashews,  Tunnockaposs Tea Cake Conclusion:  Breakfast was tasty once again, but todayaposs lunch did look a bit forlorn and beige, in fact a lot of the food I ate this week was beige, but nevertheless my jam sarnie was nice. The chicken and bacon wrap was a bit dull actually and I regretted buying two as I would have to eat it again at some point this week. At this point it felt like I was living on bread, bread and more bread.  Friday Breakfast  -  pains au chocolats Lunch  - Jam on toast Dinner  - Mediterranean pasta salad pot Snacks  -   sharing bag of Kettle Lightly Salted crisps,  banana Conclusion:  As with the pre-made salad, the pasta portion was small, so I was still hungry afterwards and I opened a bag of crisps. A big bag of crisps was more cost effective than the inidual packs on sale at the petrol station, which I realised half way through the week so I halved a large pack and put one portion in a sandwich bag for the next day. While I was tucking into my plastic pot of cold pasta on the sofa, my husband was devouring a mighty margarita pizza dripping in melted cheese and I was hugely jealous. I also realised at this point that eating out of a petrol station was a bit solitary. There was no opportunity for sharing or even finishing off his scraps like I often do. But I guess thataposs what itaposs likeyou have a job that has you working late hours or on the road a lot, and petrol stations are sometimes the only option.  Saturday Breakfast  - Omelette made with three eggs and milk, plus  banana Lunch  - Sweet potato falafal, houmous and veg sticks Dinner  - Baked beans on toast Snacks  -   sharing bag of Kettle Lightly Salted crisps Conclusion:   I used the hob for the first time this week. I really missed cooking, baking even more so. At the weekend I always bake a cake of some kind, but this was off the cards and it made me want to eat a wedge of Victoria sponge even more. Thankfully we had no plans Saturday night so I was able to make beans on toast for dinner and finish off the rest of the crisps in front of the TV. How cool am I   Sunday Breakfast  - Scrambled eggs on toast Lunch  - Chicken and bacon flatbread Dinner  - Baked beans on toast Snacks  -  banana, red grapes Conclusion:  Booo. No roast dinner. By this point I really missed a comforting, home cooked meal with hot gravy and I actually missed cooked vegetables, yes really. Eating salad in the autumn doesnapost seem quite the same as in the summer. Had I taken on this challenge during the warmer months perhaps it would have been easier. I had the flatbread for lunch and it was just as disappointing as Thursday. I didnapost want to waste it though as it had cost me nearly £. Anyway, today was the last day of my experiment and I was looking forward to not eating bread tomorrow!  Conclusion As I work in an office with access to a microwave and kettle, I was able to heat up soup and porridge during the week, my pains au chocolats too. At home I wore out the toaster, I didnapost touch the oven and I had minimal washing up - hooray. Breakfast and lunch was pretty easy as what I chose wasnapost too dissimilar to what I would normally have. I didnapost eat as many vegetables as I normally would, but I certainly ate a lot more bread and a phenomenal number of eggs. One thing that really stood out was the shear amount of food packaging piled up at the end of the week. Other than the bananas, everything came in plastic - such a waste. Also, the use-by dates on all the fridge items were just a couple of days, meaning I had no choice but to go back to the petrol station a second time to top up.  I missed my favourite roast dinner on a Sunday, a Friday night pizza with my husband and generally just a hot meal cooked from scratch with natural ingredients. I love cooking, especially for my family, and I didnapost realise how much I would miss putting a big pot of chilli on the dining room table for everyone to tuck in together. Coeliacs or vegans would struggle eating out of this petrol station for a week due to lack of choice - you wonapost find a loaf of gluten-free bread or an avocado, thataposs for sure. If I hadnapost planned each day ahead, I would have spent double the money as I would have grabbed pre-made sarnies, crisps and chocolate bars each day, as they were quick and easy. I didnapost include drinks in my venture , but had I included them, I could have expected to spend £. on a small orange juice, £. for a bottle of squash and £. for a bottle of white wine . Now, whereaposs my apron  Iaposm going to cook a roast with all the trimmings.

Little Alexander K - known as Sasha - is otherwise healthy but will never see due to a rare condition that only two other babies in the world have. His mum was raised in an orphanage and decided before his birth to give him up because she did not feel confident at being able to provide the help he would need. A nurse who is now caring for the six-month-old tot said: “He is no dferent to other children, he plays and smiles just like any healthy baby. “He loves playing and adores swimming. He is a very cheerful baby indeed.”  Enchanting Sasha is described as ‘unique’ because most babies born with the condition also have multiple other ailments. The Russian boy has two benign cysts on his forehead, which soon will be removed. He is believed to suffer in extreme form from rare SOX anophthalmia syndrome which afflicts one in a quarter of a million. Russian medics say Sasha is one of only three babies registered in the world with no eyeballs at all. Tomsk doctor Tatiana Rudnikovich said: “Sasha is going through all regular check ups and tests like any other baby of his age.  “He is doing well.” However, medics say there is currently no chance” that Sasha will ever see. His adoption listing says the boy is “a peaceful, smiling baby”. “He smiles back as soon as he hears familiar voices. “His mother signed his refusal papers in the maternity hospital.  “There is no information about Alexander’s father and there is a ‘dash’ in his birth certicate where it should have been a name of the father. “Alexander is up for adoption or foster care.” The child is initially up for adoption with Russian parents butno-one suitable comes forward, he could go to foreign parents. Currently there are restrictions to adoptions to the US. The boy’s carer nurse recently took him , miles to St Petersburg where surgeons implanted tiny eye orbs to ensure that his face is not deformed as he grows.

You don’t like to change your centre-backs.“He has worked away and has probably trained for a longer period of time than he has here for a while.“That’s the big thing. Get him training consistently then you can see the benefit.“In the second half last Saturday he was excellent, both centre-halfs were. They were really dominant and in control and never looked in any pressure in the second half.”Meanwhile, the Dens gaffer hopes Declan McDaid’s double last week against the Red Lichties can give the former Ayr winger the “belief” to push on and add the goals he is capable of.“Declan has been great,” James added. “We’ve all given him a bit about not scoring because he’s great in training.“He’s positive, scores goals and takes people on. If you got our squad to pick three players that have to start every game I think most of them would pick Declan.“Going backwards for a forward player is great for the team defensively and he deserved those goals against Arbroath because they have been coming.“It’s about belief with him because he can be a match-winner and we need that.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/SNS-19406674-Dundee-v-Arbroath-e1570463448197-940x564.jpg ","title":"dundees byrne has shoulder scan but manager mcpake hopeful he wont miss any action","story":"Shaun Byrne had a scan on his injured shoulder today as Dundee hope their midfielder isn’t set for time on the sidelines.The former Livingston man was forced off in Saturday’s - win over Arbroath following a hefty challenge that left him with a possible dislocated shoulder.Manager James McPake is hopeful, though, that the scan doesn’t reveal any lasting damage that will see him miss any actionHe said: “Shaun Byrne is alright.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

The group, the Mull of Kintyre Milk Supply Cooperative, will fund the purchase through use of a levy from every litre of milk produced, in addition to external funding which is currently being sought.A key element of the funding is the launch of the crowdfunding campaign which seeks to raise £, towards the purchase. The group is encouraging the local community, foodies, suppliers, customers, businesses and anyone with a love of cheese to contribute and further information can be found at www.crowdfunder mokcheddarIn  First Milk, a British farmer-owned dairy co-operative, announced plans to sell Campbeltown Creamery as part of a move away from smaller-scale brands.

These are big, old oaks.Appearing in support of the application, Gavin Yuill, of Galashiels-based Camerons Architects, said: ldquoIn relation to the design and placemaking, the one-and-a-half storey houses proposed are the most common house type in the rural Scottish Borders and in Minto village.ldquoThe two nearest neighbouring houses are both one-and-a-half storey, the set back of both proposed houses is consistent with the street and the stone, wet dash rendered walls, timber cladding, timber windows and doors, natural slate roofs and metal gutters are all consistent with the high-quality materials used in traditional Minto village.ldquoThe overwhelming number of retained trees, the replacement of all lost trees, and substantial new screen and hedge planting will reinforce the existing habitats and ensure that the bioersity is maximised.ldquoThese are demonstrated by the proposed landscaping drawings provided with the application.Also appearing in support of the applicant was Tim Ferguson, of Galashiels-based Ferguson Planning.He told the committee: ldquoA review of the housing analysis into the forthcoming local development plan again shows the signicant benefits windfall sites of this nature can have in meeting housing delivery targets.ldquoThe delivery of the annual housing targets are short of where they require to be and thusproposals of this nature will assist in meeting local needs.ldquoA signicant amount of housing within the Scottish Borders is met via small developments and self-build and indeed has occurred where within the confines of Mintorsquos settlement.ldquoThis subject site falls within the settlement boundary of Minto and is clearly in compliance with related planning policy principles and which has no defined restrictions upon it.Councillors also heard that planning officers are recommending the application be approved, subject to conditions.Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison said: ldquoMuch is made by the objectors that the buildings are not in keeping with Minto, yet the report from officers says that there are no two buildings the same in the village.ldquoTo be honest, they look okay to me but Irsquod need to see them in the context of what is already there.ldquoThe houses already there donrsquot look hugely architecturally important to me but perhaps Irsquom a Philistine.Members of the committee agreed to conduct a site visit, and to reconsider the application at the next meeting of the planning and building standards committee, which is due to meet on Monday, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"planned-early-years-centre-given-go-ahead","story":"COUNCIL planners have approved proposals to extend St Ronanrsquos Primary School in Innerleithen.Scottish Borders Council wants to construct a single-storey extension on the school, in order to meet demand generated by the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision to increase entitlement to free early learning and childcare provision.The new space will cater for  children, with  spaces allocated to two to three year olds, and  space set aside for three to five year olds.The plans will also see the relocation of the existing play area, a pumping station and water tank, and fenced nursery garden.A design statement, submitted by the councilrsquos in-house architect, reads: ldquoAccessibility and inclusivity have been a key focus during the design development.ldquoThe provision will be universally accessible and will offer a high-quality learning environment for the children and teaching staff.ldquoThe proposal has been developed to meet current and future teaching with the primary focus being on teaching spaces that are flexible and adaptive to cater for a iety of needs and learning experiences.ldquoThe design ethos has been simplied to provide a hierarchy of spaces from the two to three year oldrsquos playroom up to the three to five year oldrsquos playrooms with intermittent shared activity spaces in-between.ldquoLarge bi-folding doors within the play areas creates easy passage between the indoors and outdoors, encouraging independence and providing additional learning opportunities.ldquoA large canopy running theof the building strengthens the pedagogy of a seamless transition between the spaces and enables children to stay outdoors in wet weather conditions.ldquoFurthermore, it minimises solar gain during sunny weather.

He said: \"My initial concept was to produce a comparatively modest format, aimed at the photographically conscious visitor.\"By good fortune however, in engaging with Gerda as co-author, the scope and spirit of the work has been widened and deepened.\"The poems featured in this book have interacted with my images penetrating the veneer that can often dominate the city.\"All those prestigious castings and fine masonry may, collectively, have created one of Europersquos most beautul cities, but there were struggles in its making, and so often a human price was paid.\"I hope, therefore, it proves thought provoking at the very least.Gerda, who is an award-winning actor, songwriter and director as well as a writer, added: \"This has been a fascinating and welcome collaboration ndash an opportunity to reacquaint myself with my beloved home city, and its many contradictions.\"Irsquove relished both the process of responding to Allanrsquos vibrant images, and the way in which the

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead.

A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

The wind had a strange mildness in its touch.His grandson was in the joy of the moment, finding shells, climbing rocks and throwing stones into the sea. His grandfather watched, wishing he too could join in the fun. But age had crept up on him. His joints tweaked with pain every time he tried to behave like his younger self, making him very cautious. So he found a rock on which to sit and watched over his grandson as he explored.His thoughts were taken away from the beach and he began to think of his we.

It was at moments like this that he missed her most, for she loved the beach. And at night, of course, for he was still unused to sleeping alone after  years of sharing the night with the woman he loved. It didnrsquot seem right, men were supposed to be outlived by women, not left behind like this.Suddenly, his attention was caught by the sight of his grandson wading into the sea, still wearing his shoes and socks.ldquoNo lad, yoursquoll...Too late, he was jumping in the waves, splashing and laughing. His granddad rose from his rock and walked over to him.ldquoCome on granddad, jump the waves with me, he called out, his face beaming with joy. The boyrsquos shoes were now completely soaked, as were the lower part of his trousers. The old man knew he would be in trouble with his daughter for allowing this to happen. Common sense told him to get annoyed and tell his grandson to come out immediately andto the car.ldquoI donrsquot think your mum will ever trust me again to look after you, he said.Another wave rolled in and the young lad screamed with delight and jumped over it.ldquoCome on granddad!The old man reckoned that the boyrsquos shoes were already soaked and a few more minutes in the sea wouldnrsquot make things any worse. He couldnrsquot bend down properly to take his own shoes off, but he waded into the sea anyway.

restaurant and retail unit, which could be a shop.If approved, the plans would complete the wider site.David Forrest, chairman of Tranent and Elphinstone Community Council, said that the group planned to discuss the proposals at their next meeting, which takes place later this month.According to the plans, a total of  affordable homes ndash made up of the  one-bedroom flats, eight two-bedroom

An assiduous promoter of gender equality, Professor Belch pointed out that despite the wealth of opportunities open to women in medicine, when it comes to the most prestigious areas, such as heart surgery, men are still top dog.ldquoThese are jobs where you may be required to work from six in the morning to  at night, she said, ldquoand most women decided that they prefer to work part-time rather than commit to that. Not that she blames them: ldquoAfter all, we fought for their right to choose.Part-time employment is now the main obstacle in the campaign for women to be on a par with men. When a female doctor first hooks a stethoscope around her neck the future looks,not precisely plain sailing, then navigable.However,at some point she starts a family, or has older relatives to care for, opting to work part-time creates an unsolvable quandary. You could call the shorter working week a womanrsquos wrecking ball, the destroyer of youthful aspirations.Speak to thirtysomething medics, who started out intending to become heroic surgeons and physicians, and you will detect a weariness, and also a resignation to the fact that the conditions in which they are expected to perform are incompatible with any kind of normal le, let alone raising a family.As a result, an essential tier of the health system voluntarily removes itself from the full-time rota. And while hospital-based medicine is undoubtedly at the extreme end of professional expectations, given the prolonged, intense and erratic shts, what goes for medicine is also true of other careers: the advocate who must work into the small hours and over weekends to keep on top of her case load the head teacher who is in the school before breakfast, and once back home works until bedtime the farmer who labours every day of the year the journalist who cannot clock off until the late-breaking story is filed.No wonder people in these occupations wondertheyrsquove been put on the rack, as they are slowly stretched to breaking point. Yet when doctors, and other high-fliers, decide to go part-time, it is a self-inflicted slow puncture. All the training, expertise and experience they have acquired, all the momentum they have gathered, begins to deflate. Friends and family feel secretly disappointed that a seemingly stellar career has lost its stardust. Worse, the part-timer often feels she is in some unfathomable way to blame for not being able to juggle everybodyrsquos expectations, including her own, yet still have a le worth living.By drawing attention to the part-time glass ceiling, Professor Belch highlights how complicated and protracted the business of reaching true equality remains. The effort to increase the number of women entering medical school, which was once seen as the solution to the predominance of males, succeeded years ago. Indeed, that hurdle has been so successfully overcome there are sometimes more girls in class than boys.The problem is that, in the early years of feminism, none of us looked far enough ahead. Lacking imagination, perhaps, or brimming with optimism, we did not give a thought to the lelong path ndash more accurately a tight-rope ndash on which working women must keep their balance. Once aloft, they need to stay upright not merely when they are young and full of energy, but as their lestyles change, their commitments grow, and their attitudes mature.Belchrsquos comments are a long overdue corrective to the notion that the ward ndash or boardroom, laboratory, lecture hall ndash is as welcoming for women as men. In so doing she has also pointed to the unrealistically tough regime in which many professionals are expected to survive. Itrsquos not just women who have a family to raise, or other caring responsibilities, and itrsquos not just women who feel they must clone themselves in order to get through everything the working day ndash and the action-packed weekend ndash demands. Singletons, or those with partners but no children, can still find employersrsquo expectations excessive and debilitating. The dedication and single-eyed focus required to keep on top of the most responsible roles takes a toll on everyone.Doubtless burn-out existed in Edwardian times, it just didnrsquot have a label. Today we have inherited a pitiless culture in which status is calculated by how visibly gruelling your job is. The more punishing your hours and the less time you have at home, the higher your place on the ladder of awe. The employee who can be home shortly after five, and has all evening in which to help their kids with homework or go to the gym, is unlikely to score impressively on the Richter scale of professional achievement. Yet she, or he, might have a really well thought-out le, with their priorities in the right order.The dilemma facing society is not simply how to help part-time women reach the very top but how to recalibrate these Alpha workplaces. The challenge for employers who do not want talented staff to drt off or grow disheartened is to come up with ways to make these all-consuming roles desirable, but also manageable, for a far wider range of iniduals.At the moment, physical and psychological stamina are almost as essential as professional excellence for someone to thrive in such an environment. Yet how many does that automatically exclude  Instead of a place that resembles the trenches, we need to restructure hospitals, banks, or the courts, so that they properly value ambitious and able part-timers. Far from discriminating against their promotion, they should encourage it. A good place to start might be to banish the adjective ldquopart-time, and its belittling connotations, once and for all."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-mckenna-declaration-independence-everything-brexiters-despise","story":"It wonrsquot, of course. Already, Unionist and Conservative lips are curling in disdain at a statement they portray as woolly, inconsequential and dreamily optimistic. Any document containing words such as \"non-aggression\", \"transparency\", \"scrutiny\" and \"kindness\" was always going to be treated with the caution of a bomb-disposal unit. The Labour Party in Scotland, meanwhile, will simply get Gordon Brown to describe it as nasty, isive and a risk to old peoplersquos pensions.At other times in Scotlandrsquos history, and in other circumstances, perhaps this document would have left itself open to charges of conceit: the entitled caprice of a comfortable elite who can afford to indulge each other at their dinner- parties and in their salons. It doesnrsquot exactly fuel the fires of revolution or rage against injustice. Its tone is that of a retired person asking why his discount voucher doesnrsquot apply during peak periods.The following passage is instructive: ldquoOwnership of land, property and natural resources should be subject to open and democratic scrutiny. Well, quite. As a statement of intent itrsquos about as radical as a halloumi and bean crepe. I would have had something like this: ldquoOwnership of land, property and natural resources should be reviewed urgently and then determined by a system of local peoplersquos tribunals prior to re-distribution.Herersquos another one: ldquoWe affirm the values of care, kindness, neighbourliness and generosity of spirit in all our dealings. Irsquom sure that line is Emilyrsquos from one of her daily chats with Bagpuss on childrenrsquos television many years ago. Shouldnrsquot there have been some kind of an ldquoor hellip at the end of it I think, though, we should resist the temptation to mock. We should suspend our cynicism. At this time in the history of these islands, wersquove never been in more urgent need of a manesto for decency which, essentially, is what this declaration for independence is all about. Very little of it is new or unexpected. If you are inclined to be liberal in your instincts while respecting the other personrsquos point of view yoursquoll agree with most of this, evenyou donrsquot subscribe to its over-arching conclusion, that these aspirations are best guaranteed in an independent Scotland.The wary optimism now being expressed by both sides as midnight approaches on our departure from the European Union will not repair the damage thatrsquos been done to Britain over the course of the last three years. All debate about the economic cost of Brexit and the threat to jobs, fuel and medicine ceased a long time ago. The disputed weight of consequences and the potential impact on daily lives came to be replaced by something more visceral and elemental that adhered to the rules of a pitbull fight. Thus it became a raw struggle for the soul of England and England alone.In this, notions of ethnic superiority began to hold sway fed by a steady stream of xenophobia from Englandrsquos red-top army. The High Tories, the architects of this extreme Brexit, encouraged these ideas and beseeched their Etonian chums in Englandrsquos great media houses to fan the flames. Only by appealing to this hidden fury, bottled up for decades after the end of the Second World War, could they hope to camouflage their ultimate aim of sweeping away all possible obstacles to accumulating wealth with the merest measure of scrutiny. Brexit was their once-in-a-letime opportunity to make laws unto themselves. Trling considerations like ldquocare, kindness, neighbourliness and generosity of spirit were regarded as collateral damage.Those Dorian Grays among the Tories who lately began to recoil at this image of what their party had been all this time seemed genuinely shocked. They expressed sorrow that \"decent\" Toryism and \"gentle\" Toryism and \"ethical\" Toryism had been abducted by the Cummings Johnson Gove axis. Perhaps they also believe in vegan alligators. Extreme Brexit and its beliefs are merely the quintessence of what Conservatism has ever been about: preserving power by all means necessary for as few people as possible. How did they think this was all going to end The Declaration for Independence produced in Scotland represents all that is regarded as anathema to the Brexiteers and Little England fanaticism. Inexact, hopefully optimistic and grandiose this document may have been but it was also a rebuke to the hollowed-out version of humanity that has fuelled Brexit.The Declaration for Independence also carried a subliminal message to the SNP as its members and activists gather in Aberdeen tomorrow for their annual conference. The party has yet to espouse a coherent and consistent position on Brexit, a truth that was brutally exposed by a wide-ranging poll carried by the Wings Over Scotland website, which remains the wider Yes movementrsquos most influential weather-vane. The way in which the SNPrsquos increasingly exclusive and controlling central office has sought to ensure that there will be no dissenting voices about this in Aberdeen is becoming a major problem.Another concern is widespread discontent about the stitch-ups masquerading as a candidate selection process for representation at Westminster.

Its move means the contract, announced last month, is now in what is called ldquoextended standstill.: Lasers find a thousand new archaeological sites on ArranA spokesperson for David MacBrayne Ltd, CalMacrsquos state-owned parent company, said: ldquoHaving won the tender for the Northern Isles ferry services on price, we are in dialogue with Transport Scotland and analysing the detailed information we requested from them about their scoring process.ldquoAs we are still in what is now an extended standstill period, we cannot comment further.Islands minister Paul Wheelhouse announced Serco was the preferred bidder for the contract with news of a three-year fares freeze for island passengers and  per cent discounts for cabins on long routes from Aberdeen to the islands.The franchise, called Northlink, also includes shorter hops from Scrabster in Caithness to Stromness in Orkney. The route has one of Scotlandrsquos few non-subsidised rivals, from near John OrsquoGroats to St Margaretrsquos Hope.Serco Group Chief Executive Rupert Soames welcomed the announcement, saying: ldquoWe are very proud of our track record over the past seven years, during which time we have improved almost every aspect of the leline service for the communities and businesses of the Northern Isles.Serco ferries have not faced the same problems CalMac has dealt with in recent years.Decades of under-investment and climate change have left the state operator with ships and ports that are often unable to offer or complete services.Most recently, there was disruption on CalMacrsquos flagship route from Ayrshire to Arran earlier this month.There was always expected to be a ldquostandstill period before the Northlink contract, which runs for eight years, was signed. But it was supposed to be only  days.Unions and the Labour Party had lobbied heavily for public-sector CalMac to get the contract. This would have brought all of Scotlandrsquos subsidised ferries under one state operator.After the announcement of the preferred bidder was made, Mr Wheelhouse faced questions in Holyrood about the decision.Scottish Greensrsquo Highlands and Islands MSP John Finnie quizzed him on why and how Serco was chosen.Mr Wheelhouse responded: ldquoSerco Ltd was awarded the status of preferred bidder on the basis of an assessment ratio of % price and % quality, as was set out in the tender documents and made clear to all bidders when the invitation to tender was issued.ldquoSerco was assessed as providing the most economically advantageous tender under the terms of the competition, with a tender that was evaluated under the tender criteria to provide high-quality ferry services and value for money for the taxpayer.CalMac told The Herald its bid was cheaper than Sercorsquos. This suggests Sercorsquos quality of service must have been judged much better than CalMacrsquos since price is scored twice as highly as quality.A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: ldquoUntil the new contract for the Northern Isles ferry services is awarded this is a live procurement [and] there is a limit on what can be said at this time. However, more detailed information will be provided in due course and when it is more appropriate to do so.: Scientists discover twenty previously unknown moons orbiting SaturnldquoWe continue to engage with the European Commission regarding the ongoing complaint from Pentland Ferries following receipt of further approaches from the Commission.ldquoThis will not have an impact on the Scottish Government commitment, from January , to introduce a % discount on cabin fares on the Aberdeen-Kirkwall-Lerwick routes, as well as a three-year fares freeze for passengers, non-commercial vehicles and cabins on these routes.Mr Finnie challenged Mr Wheelhouse on the decision. He said: ldquoLast year, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Economy and Fair Work signed a commitment to application of the fair work principles across the Scottish Government and associated bodies. RMT is in the process of taking strike action against Serco, as the operator of the Caledonian sleeper train, for reneging on pledges to address serious concerns about staff safety.ldquoCan the minister honestly tell Parliament that Serco is living up to the fair work principles  If not, perhaps he can explain why the fair work convention was considered to be suitable for civil servants but not for people who work in the transport sector under Serco "},{"url":null,"title":"tedx-sees-inspirational-speakers-scottish-university","story":"Taking place at Glasgow Caledonian University, the event was independently organised by  students and is the first TEDx conference hosted by the university.The event TEDxGlasgowCaledonianUniversity was named Unfolding Good Together embracing the universityrsquos commitment to the common good.Co-organiser of the conference Martyna Kowaleksaid: ldquoWe wanted to create something we could leave for the university and have the people engaged in the common good which is the theme of our university.ldquoWe wanted to do something more than just studying.ldquoThe common good stands for responsible leadership, entrepreneurial mindsets, local and global citizenship, and confidence and every speech is connected to each of those attributes.There were ten speakers at the event which included surgically-trained doctor Mohammed Enayat, technology CEO Vicky Brock, scientist Timi Hesselhoj, PHD researcher Benjamin Butterworth and others.:Inspiring City Awards celebrate vision of city role modelsTimi Hesselhoj is a scientist receiving her Masters of Research at Kingrsquos College London spoke about the underrepresentation of women in science and her project Rosalind Franklin The Meeting of Minds.She said: ldquoTED has a voice and it reaches m subscribers on their  and TED as a conference has come a long way, it has gravitas.Speaking of her project: ldquoWhat we want to do is bring visibility to science, bring visibility to the Randall centre for cell molecular biophysics at Kings College.She chose her ldquoheroine Rosalind Franklin as the basis of the project as ldquoduring her time she wasnrsquot acknowledged and this is very important for us now.Another speaker Saba Youssef is the director of Nanotera Group which invests in start-up technologies and launch the products with ldquoblue chip companies and government around the world to help them remediate environmental companies at tiny costs.She spoke about being a woman in STEM: ldquoI want to highlight that being a woman in business isnrsquot easy but I want to motivate other women to go for it and to know that they can also do it.ldquoTED is a respected source and medium of communication and we are so happy that we get our message across to so many people because there are some people that my message wonrsquot reach but TED can reach.The conference also featured three performers including Scottish musician Josephine Sillars,Glasgow-based band Dogtooth, and singer Marysia Trembecka.:First Glasgow back inspirational kids from St Josephrsquos with their Climate Week activityInspirational consultant Ross Reekie also spoke at the conference about creating meaning at work through taking ldquolittle leaps every day.He said: ldquoTED is synonymous with good ideas and spreading messages and I think it is a force for positive good in the world.Other speakers at the conference were Chocolate Tree founder Alistair Gower, inspirational speaker Ciara Jean Roberts, fashion designer Jeff Garner, and CEO of Hydrogen Mike Scott."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-greens-launch-2021-election-campaign","story":"During a joint speech from co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, Ms Slater declared the campaign for election in  \"starts right now\".All six of the partys current MSPs, with the exception of the retiring John Finnie, were re-selected as candidates.The party announced the top two candidates who will stand for election in the eight regions across Scotland.:Greens aim high at next election in order to lower emissionsMs Slater also called for the party to \"do politics and power dferently\".She said: \"Ive been thinking about courage recently and how so much of what is going on around us is due to a lack of courage.\"It takes courage to stand up and say, things are going to change.\"Courage appears to be an outmoded value in many of our leaders and public figures.\"It takes courage to be honest, dishonesty is cowardly.\"We need to do our politics and power dferently.

Theyrsquore not hillwalking and outside types.ldquoThey are people who donrsquot want to spend pound or pound to use a campsite.

I donrsquot want to impinge on anyonersquos rights to roam, I want to stop people having the right to make a mess.The petition says the impact of wild camping, particularly on the NC route, has been ldquoconsiderable and adds it has become ldquoexceptionally problematic for local authorities and public bodies to deal with and at great expense to the public purse.:Herald Entrepreneur: Hone your vision so you have a strong foundation from which to build your businessIt points out that the problem isnrsquot restricted to the areas which line the NC route, with complaints about the impact of wild campers emerging from the Western Isles and other Scottish tourist hotspots across the country.In it, Currie adds: ldquoInformal encouragement has not been sufficient to stop the degradation of our infrastructure and environment.ldquoEven with an increased focus on responsible camping from public authorities and the NC organisation, the situation appears to be getting worse rather than better.ldquoThe route of the NC is becoming totally unsuitable for small rural communities in the north of Scotland.The NC tourist trail has been credited with transforming tourism to Scotlandrsquos northwest coast since its launch in .Most travellers opt to start at Inverness and take in a -mile loop around the northern tip of the mainland, before eventually ing to the Highland capital.Part of its charm is the long distances travellers can cover without encountering the distractions of modern le, around one-fth of it on narrow, single-track roads.With accommodation limited to small BBs, inns and hotels, many visitors opt to travel the route in campervans or with tents for camping under the stars.But while the route is said to have added at least pound million to the regionrsquos economy and brought over , visitors, people living in the area have become increasingly outspoken over the impact of tourism on their fragile environment.Wild camping is legal in Scotland. However, campers are expected to stick to the Scottish Outdoor Access Code which suggests it should involve camping for just two or three nights at a time and be ldquolightweight, with small numbers of people and no trace left on the natural surroundings.According to the Holyrood petition, no camping zones would allow local authorities to encourage responsible tourism and encourage campers to use campsites and their facilities to dispose of waste properly.It could see camping banned at increasingly popular wild camping sites near cities in areas such as Ayrshire, West Dunbartonshire, Fe, East Lothian and Aberdeenshire.The petition does not set out to ban wild camping entirely, just from areas close to roadsides which are becoming overwhelmed with campers.Wild camping has already been outlawed around parts of Loch Lomond.But there are concerns about how stringently councils will impose the no camping rules which could affect mountaineers and walkers who want to pitch a tent during overnight expeditions.Responses to the online petition have included comments which support the call and highlight inidual problem areas. One claims that campervans park within  metres of a campsite in Tongue rather than use its facilities, while another said simply: ldquoDone seeing bins overflowing in the middle of nowhere and people having a lsquonumber tworsquo outside their camping site.Another wrote: ldquoHaving visited the south side of Loch Tummel for nearly  years it has been devastating to witness the rubbish people leave behind when wild camping.ldquoSome of my favourite walking spots are now no-go areas due to human waste and view spots are ruined by rubbish.Others, however, spoke out against the idea of legislation with one commenting: ldquoEroding the rights of all citizens is not the answer.Another said: ldquoImposing complete bans totally ruins it for those acting responsibly and goes against everything the current outdoor access code stands for.Helen Todd, Ramblers Scotlandrsquos campaigns and policy manager, said: ldquoSadly there are ongoing issues in hotspot areas with an antisocial minority who are damaging the environment, the reputation of campers and the outdoor experience for everyone who loves our countryside.ldquoThe entire outdoor community shares the frustration of residents about these people, whose selfish actions impact upon communities, landscapes and the thousands of responsible people who enjoy camping away from formal sites across Scotland.ldquoWe are calling for antisocial camping to be tackled through stronger enforcement of the existing laws, provision of facilities and more low-cost campsites, and investment in education on responsible access ndash rather than new costly and ineffective laws or by-laws, which themselves would need enforced.ldquoIn many instances, responsible roadside camping away from houses is legal, legitimate and simply the best option.ldquoFor example, winter climbers arriving late ahead of a pre-dawn start, cycle tourers, disabled campers who benefit from being near their car, canoeists and anglers at road-circled lochs and long-distance walkers.She added: ldquoRather than banning campers, the best solution is to try out ious visitor management measures, such as investment in infrastructure like low-cost campsites, toilets and litter bins, and lots of education. This should be monitored and adjusted as time goes on to find out what works best.ldquoIn addition, enforcement of existing legislation like breach of the peace, vandalism and littering can be carried out by the police in areas known to be hotspots.ldquoI donrsquot think anyone involved with setting up NC expected it to be as spectacular a success story in terms of numbers, but the infrastructure is not there. They put the cart before the horse. A lot of public money was spent marketing this route but there was a failure to provide an effective infrastructure for anyone using it.A spokesman for North Coast  said: ldquoLitter is a problem associated with most human activities and it should be recognised that residents are as likely to be responsible as visitors for negligent waste disposal.

For where does a man go after having his face sewn onto silk sheets and draped over the worldrsquos most advanced nuclear missiles  Perhaps only John Connor, the troublesome rebel commander in the Dark Fate documentary, would understand the aching loneliness of being the person all others follow and revere.Producer James Cameron certainly understands the isolation one feels upon reaching the top of the mountain. This is a man who takes orders from no-one, continually disregarding the advice of pygmies to do exactly what he wants ndash presently defying the wishes of everyone who saw Avatar to create four sequels.And in Dark Fate, this true visionary has produced a seminal work that captures todayrsquos inter-connected, forward-thinking world perfectly. Totalitarian dystopia. The illusion of freewill. Ethnic cleansing slowly validated through drip-fed propaganda.

It was heartening, however, that the filmrsquos concluding message was that all soldiers share the same fate no matter what side they serve ndash blind submission in the face of power.For in Dark Fate, itrsquos only upon dying for their worthless humanist cause that the rebels realise they were never free, that they were simply fighting for an alternative form of slavery ndash collared at the end of a leash held by a master called John Connor, who sent them to fight an unwinnable war. America never learns.

And my personal favourite, our DF- ballistic missile ndash which cannot be destroyed by any known defence system due to its unmatchable speed.And even though our Skynet has a similar modus operandi to the self-aware computer in Dark Fate, the US recently announced they are now blacklisting many Chinese tech companies that develop our facial recognition software and other AI technology. They claim our  million CCTV cameras are being used to repress Chinarsquos Muslim minority groups.Still, it wont long until we catch up with the  million cameras now deployed in the US, which shoot four billion hours of footage each week. And when we do, Americans can take solace in the fact itrsquos perhaps not long until until they catch up on copying our lsquogreat wallrsquo idea too!Terminator: Dark Fate rating: ***** Five stars And finally ...THE Pentagon may tremble in fear of our technological prowess, military might and brainwashed . billion populace being prepared for war, but US companies still love China. And we love them for their friendly customer service ndash always willing to accommodate the needs of totalitarian regimes for a few billion dollars. And again, Id like to thank Apple for pulling the Taiwanese flag emoji from keyboards in Hong Kong. Not that I was ever aware of the existence of a Taiwanese flag, of course.Yet, the US government thinks dferently from apolitical facilitators and enablers such as Apple. They claim we donrsquot respect international norms like the rule of law or basic human rights, and that our AI superiority is globally destabilising.But take our Skynet system ndash even the post-apocalyptic wasteground of Glasgow in Scotland is embracing similar technology so police can identy non-conformists.

Always a source of wise counsel in these matters, he said: ldquoAI is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will be the ruler of the world.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.carlukegazette webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Wallace Day  Aug\"  Braveheart spiritlives on in Lanark viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"CARL | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

It neither meets the needs of the local community nor the standards people in Orkney have a right to expect from their leline service.“I have raised these concerns with the First Minister and Transport Secretary in the past, highlighting the impact on constituents. I was given assurances that it would be addressed in the new contract.“Given the announcement that Serco Northlink has been chosen as the preferred bidder, it is important that the Scottish Government now claries what the arrangements will be for the forthcoming refit period.#The new contract needs to address the failings of the current contract and ensure that this leline route is served during the refit period by a vessel that is fit for purpose”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The RNLI relies on donations to provide this training, to ensure that our leboat crew is as well prepared as they can be to help save lives at sea.”.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsay man gets new role at lerwick harbour ","story":"Capt Arthur was recruited to succeed Alexander Simpson who was recently promoted to harbourmaster.Deputy harbourmaster Captain Neil Arthur.Port authority chief executive Calum Grains said: #We are delighted to welcome Neil and the contribution he will make to our operations across the ious industry sectors.#Capt Arthur began his career as a cadet with Clyde Marine in , with sponsorship from the specialist geared cargo company Gearbulk.He later gained a BSc in Nautical Science from Strathclyde University and qualied as an officer from Glasgow College of Nautical Studies.Following employment by Gearbulk as a junior officer, he moved into the offshore industry with Subsea  for  years, rising through the ranks and gaining his chief officer#s licence from Glasgow College of Nautical Studies and master#s from Glasgow Maritime Academy..."},{"url":null,"title":"shetland among most vulnerable to brexit says msp todd ","story":"The SNP member has demanded that Brexit is halted and claims half of Shetlanders live in vulnerable communities.Maree ToddMs Todd is basing that on Scottish government analysis which led to the publication of #The Local Level Brexit Vulnerabilities in Scotland Report# this week. It states that rural and remote areas, especially those in The Highlands and Islands, have signicant populations at risk from the fallout of leaving the EU – with or without a trade deal.The report considers community access to services, working-age population, income deprivation, workers in #Brexit-sensitive# industries, EU worker migration and how many EU payments are received.Highlands and Islands representative Ms Todd said: “We always knew that Brexit would be damaging to Scotland but this new analysis really hits home the devastating impact that Brexit will have here in the Shetland Islands.“Families across Shetland will feel the impact of Brexit, with up to  per cent of the local population most vulnerable to the potential economic shock.“The SNP government will continue to do what it can to mitigate and minimise the impact on our most vulnerable communities, but this study lays bare the recklessness of the Tories in their blind determination to pursue Brexit at any cost.“Scotland never voted for Brexit and certainly not for the reckless extreme version now pursued by the UK government. It’s essential that we stop Brexit and go back to the people.”Ms Todd added that a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , also published this week, #found the UK is already £ billion worse off as a result of Brexit before we have even left the EU – with the UK economy .- per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been.#Over a million voters in Scotland voted for BREXIT, % of Shetlanders voted to leave, are their votes to be ignored  As a UNITED Kingdom we operate as a single unit well we did during two world wars. I find that Maree Todd’s concern about the potential economic effect that BREXIT could have upon Shetlanda bit of a cheek, coming from a party that currently has chalked up a deficit of £ billion for Scotland, due to irresponsible spending policies.Brexit, is nothing more than for the Tories to distance themselves from the EU, and to have a trade deal with the USA, and the, most likely, mass privatisation of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to US companies, where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It is so typical of the Tories to put themselves first regardless to the devastating consequences of their policies and selfish agenda#s onto the people of the UK, especially those in society who struggle as it is. It will be a society of those who have and those who do not have. Where profit is the dominating principle which governs and controls those in power. Brexit, will make the UK, very much an unfair, unjust society for the majority of people. It will also have a great impact on smaller communities where the work-force is from the EU, and the economic circumstances putting many jobs and businesses at risk.Brexit, in all its forms, will cause more harm than good####not to mention poking the fires of xenophobia and racism in its wake.If Shetland is #among the most vulnerable to Brexit#, then presumably, it will also be #among the most vulnerable to Scexit# as we are guaranteed to be out of the EU with No Deal, should the SNP#s policy of Scottish independence ever become reality Tulloch undermines himself. As a UNITED Europe we acted as a single unit. Why should leaving one Union be better than leaving the other  He should reflect on the plain fact that it isn’t our European neighbours that are demanding we split from England against our stated will.“Take back control” my rear end.Peter Hamilton, we agree at last. You, at last, you admit to talking from your rear end!! Now it all makes sense.No Peter, it is the Tories. As I have previously mentioned, their agenda is nothing more than to privatise and hand control of the UK#s Health Care and and other Infrastructure to US companies, where the Tories will benefit mostly. The cost of living under Brexit, will most certainly increase, and the people most affected by it will struggle even more.The Tories, as they have always done, have only thought of themselvesand what they can gain regardless to the damaging consequences upon everybody  in society.Their policies and political motives are highly isive, and generally do more harm than good to society as a whole..."},{"url":null,"title":"10b charlotte street ","story":"Offers over £,Good-sized, three bedroom, single storey detached property in large, well-established garden with amenities including the High School, leisure centre and Co-op within easy reach, and Lerwickwithin easy commuting distance.In addition to three double bedrooms, the double glazed accommodation which has central heating provided by an air source heat pump, also includes a living room, spacious kitchen   dining room, family bathroom  utility room.

Work was due to begin on the £.million project in August, but campaigners had occupied the green for over  days in a bid to block the development. Since , Friends of Glassmullin Open Greenhave campaigned against the facility, which is funded by Education NI for De La Salle College.In recent days, however, through consultation and engagement, the school and local community representatives have reached an agreement that will pave the way for the new G pitch. Amongst the terms of the agreement is a commitment that there will be no floodlights and a fence will not exceed . metres at the facility.The resolution will further ensure that there will be no infrastructure put in place for the installation of floodlights at a later date.A seven-person committee made up of school representatives, residents, and an independent chair will now be appointed to manage the facility.Local residents, Martin Derby and Anthony Marron, commented: “We have agreed, in good faith, a pathway to allow for the construction of the De La Salle Sports Facility to commence. Recently we have been part of positive and open discussions with the college and the outcome is a cohesive proposal that benefits all parties involved. This proposal has now been accepted and we will work closely together through a newly formed committee for the project delivery. We will continue to act with the community and our young people at heart throughout the forthcoming process.”Claire White, Principal De La Salle College, said: #The school is delighted to have worked in partnership with local residents to reach a mutual agreement thus allowing for the construction of the sports facility to begin. The facility will provide much needed sports amenities for the pupils of De La Salle College as well as for young people within the community. We are excited to see the project come to fruition and are looking forward to participating and working with the newly formed committee to ensure community cohesion.#Construction of the facility is due to start imminently partnered with ongoing engagement across residents and interest groups via the newly formed joint committee."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"blessed trinity students set for south africa","story":"NINE Year  students from Blessed Trinity College are preparing for the trip of a letime to South Africa.The young people have teamed up with Paddy Doyle from New Lodge Youth Centre and the Connections Youth Project.They will travel to South Africa on October  to spend  days working on a number of dferent projects in Durban and the surrounding towns and villages before ing home on November .This is the first time the project has been run with a school and Bernadette Little, Vice-Principal of Blessed Trinity College Antrim Road site, is delighted with the upcoming opportunity for the students.“We are happy and privileged to have been asked to come on board the project,” she explained.“We ran an internal application process open to all students and there was a lot of interest,” she said. “They then went for an interview to sell their qualities and skills before the final nine were chosen. There has been a lot of work done already with a lot of preparation and education about culture in South Africa.“It is once in a letime opportunity and will give the students more of a clear direction of what they want to do in le when they come back.”Student Ryan McCarthy explained more about what the trip will entail.“We had to do a lot of fundraising which involved bag packing and setting up pages on Facebook to raise the £, required for cover our travel and donate towards dferent projects out there,” he said. “The first seven days we will spend in homeless shelters before moving to work in villages and towns outside Durban. We will be fully integrated in the community and there will be no luxuries.“We will live with local people and their families and help build houses and other things to help the community and work on dferent projects.“It will be very much a hands-on experience. It is not a holiday for us. We have also been learning the Zulu culture which is everything from song, language, games and dance, which we will use to communicate with the children who don’t speak much English. We want to respect their culture and integrate ourselves into theirs.”Another student, Holly O’Neill, believes she will take a lot from the experience.“I think the trip will teach us a lot about how we take for granted how we live back at home,” she said. “These people in South Africa are poor. We will feel lucky to live here. People complain about all the bad stuff in the news here but it is nothing compared to over there. People have nothing compared to us. The whole experience so far has given us all more confidence. We were all shy and didn’t talk much to each other but now we are all talking more and working together as a team.“The travel is daunting – around  hours – but we are all looking forward to it and want to make the most out of it. I remember the feeling when I got picked for this le changing experience, I was speechless.“The amount of dedication that has to be put in is crazy, but working as a team I know we can get through it.“Something that has really been outstanding for me has definitely been the Monday night groups that I look forward to for a good laugh and good craic.“I’m just so thankful to have been chosen for this le changing experience.”Paddy Doyle from Connections Youth Project added: “I wanted to change the project a bit and develop young leaders within a school environment.“The young people have worked really hard in their preparation so far and I know we are going to have a successful trip. I can’t wait for it. It is a new programme for me as well but it will create a lot of memories and experiences for the young people.”You can keep up to date with the young people’s journey in South Africa on the Connections Youth Project Facebook page."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"neurology waiting lists a disgrace","story":"ALLIANCE Health spokesperson Paula Bradshaw has branded the latest neurology waiting lists “a disgrace” and warned they are the latest example of people paying for others’ political irresponsibility.The South Belfast MLA was speaking after it was revealed the number of people waiting for a first neurology outpatient appointment here has more than doubled in the past four years.More than , patients have also been waiting more than one year to be seen.“The doubling of waiting lists in the past four years is the latest example of the Health Service descending into a two-tier system, with those who can afford it getting quick diagnoses and treatment while others are left to their anxiety about what is wrong for over a year. This is now a dysal system,” she said.“At the heart of this is the refusal of those with the biggest mandates to take the responsibility for governing which comes with those mandates. They know well a deal has long been available but decisions which are unpopular in the short term will need to be made for the long-term good of the healthcare system and public health.“We must never stop being shocked by figures such as these, which are unacceptable and show a decline in planning for the future, going back many years. It is time for comprehensive transformation or there simply will not be a public health service for the next generation # and it is time those with the big mandates took responsibility for delivery of it.”SDLP Deputy Leader Nichola Mallon called the waiting times for a first neurology outpatient appointment “unacceptable”.The North Belfast MLA said that staff are working tirelessly to manage demand while also coping with the biggest patient recall in history. “Neurology patients, people living with conditions like Parkinson’s disease, Motor Neurone disease or multiple sclerosis, should not be forced to endure the pain, worry and uncertainty of waiting over a year to be seen,” she said. “That’s the cruel reality for over , people who understand the seriousness of their condition and desperately want to be seen and treated as quickly as possible.“These patients and the staff working in neurology units deserve better. Aside from the immense challenge of having almost , people on the neurology waiting list, doctors and nurses are trying their best to cope with the biggest patient recall in our history. It must feel overwhelming.“We have had reviews of neurology services before. I have no doubt that the final report will reach similar conclusions with similar recommendations. They cannot be allowed to sit on a shelf gathering dust while real people suffer on hospital waiting lists. This is a scandal and we all have to commit to addressing it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the great outdoors at a local nursery school","story":"AIDAN Crean fully understands young people’s concern for nature and the future of our planet – in fact the west Belfast environmental supremo ‘got it’ well before anyone  did.When he was young and with the Troubles raging all around, nature and the environment weren’t high on many people’s list of priorities. But Aidan was intrigued by the natural world – just like so many youngsters today – and when he was  his le changed forever when a simple thing happened – his father bought him a pair of binoculars so he could better study the birds he spent so much time watching in the gardens of Riverdale.Those old second-hand binoculars were the catalyst that propelled him on a le journey that culminated this week in the opening of an Eco Wildle Garden at St Michael’s Nursery School in Andersonstown.The garden was a labour of love for Aidan and fellow wildle crusader Debbie ‘Doolittle’ Nelson. Their plan to build a nature haven for kids – rather than a common play park – got the full backing of the school. Principal Clare McAllister said the children now choose themselves to go outdoors every day.“They just love to be outside in the middle of nature – so many children don’t get the opportunity to getoutside. And I think this park will encourage children and parents to use our parks and public amenities more,” she said. Board of Governors chairperson Sean Óg McGuinness said that even bad weather doesn’t deter the kids. “They just put on their wet gear and can’t wait to get out to play. It’s a nature paradise.”Aidan and Debbie spent months designing and perfecting the garden – Debbie herself did all the joinery work, making the  bird boxes, as well as hedgehog havens in each corner and a wildle pond.“I planted giant water lilies for dragonflies to rest on, and just as I was putting them in during the summer a dragonfly flew by,” said Debbie. “So even though we’re in the heart of West Belfast there are still some rarities about here.”Debbie even managed to allow pathways for hedgehogs to the fenced-off pond by cutting mini-archways into the fence. “The pond itself has wee ramps so frogs and newts and hedgehogs can safely visit it,” she said.And the nestboxes aren’t just to attract garden birds – one at the front of the school has been designed for kestrels. Aidan said: “You can just imagine the faces of the kidsa pair of kestrels take up residence here. It would be fantastic.”In fact the boxes are designed to provide homes for seven other species – including swts, robins, house sparrows, treecreepers and bats. The children’s eco garden – behind the school beside St Michael’s church – is sheltered by giant trees including oaks that long predate the school – “it could be one of the oldest oak trees in West Belfast,” said Aidan.He added: “We need to be teaching young ones, today, at home, in school and crucially in the nursery – the formative years – how to appreciate and look after wildle, the pollinators, birds, bats, hedgehogs, vegetables, amphibians, orchards and ultimately ourselves so to be best placed in years to come to deal with all the many complex survival challenges ahead for people and bioersity.” Things were so dferent when Aidan was young. The binoculars which helped instil a love of nature unfortunately didn’t last long. British soldiers based in nearby Casement noticed them being used at an upstairs window and thought they were being spied on. They raided his house, running up the stairs to find Aidan birdwatching from his bedroom.The soldiers confiscated the binoculars. “The gave me a wee ticket, and said I could collect them when the Troubles were over,” Aidan said this week. “I never imagined that would be  years later!” Aidan never got his hands on those binoculars again, but he attributes that short time spent with that special gt from his father to his lelong love of nature. Five years later, his father was killed by a British army Saracen in a crash on the Falls Road.“Those binoculars launched me on the journey that I’m still enjoying. And I hope this eco garden will have the same effect by inspiring the next generation of youngsters,” he said."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38573258.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/_109142883_constabledowney.jpg","title":"10k for psni officer discriminated against","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

discriminated against. https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland k-for-psni-officer-discriminated-against-over-beard-.htmlhttps:www.belfasttelegraph incoming article.ece ff AUTOCROP h __constabledowney.jpgEmailA police firearms officer who was suspended for refusing to shave his beard has said he has been \"vindicated\" after an employment tribunal found he had been discriminated against..pushConstable Gordon Downey was temporarily transferred from the predominantly male Armed Response Unitin February  for not being willing to comply with a policy forcing officers to be clean-shaven.He later brought an employment tribunal case against then-Chief Constable George Hamilton claiming he had been discriminated against, a view which was supported by an employment tribunal.The PSNI has said it is aware of the tribunals findings and said it is currently examining the detail.Speaking to BBC News NI, Constable Downey said: \"To be turfed out of the unit, with little or no notice, for refusal to shave off a moustache, which doesnt affect the equipment Ive been issued with, is total madness.\"Read MoreMoustache would have to be a ‘belter’ to impair PSNI mask, tribunal toldPSNI ponytail rule not enforced like one for beards, tribunal toldPSNI firearms officer tells tribunal of his face mask concernsNew rules outlawing beards and facial hair were implemented in  for some units in the PSNI due to health and safety concerns.The updated policy required these officers to \"remain clean shaven whilst on duty\" for health and safety reasons.The case centred over whether respiratory masks used in certain police units, and which are supposed to be airtight, can be used safelythe officer has facial hair.Expert advice to the tribunal  previously claimed men would need \"a moustache like a walrus\" for the equipment not to work properly.\"The policy itself was being enforced against men under health and safety grounds, and yet females within our unit had hair in contravention of the same policy, not facial hair but head hair, where there was a grab risk,\" Constable Downey said.\"So the policy was being enforced against men and not against female officers.\"Constable Downey said he tried to accommodate the policy by shaving his beard to a moustache but was also asked to remove that.\"As an older person with a receding hairline and alopecia who is slightly overweight all I can do is grow a bit of fur on my top lip, and to have that removed for absolutely no reason is wrong,\" he said.The unanimous decision of the tribunal was that Constable Downey was discriminated against contrary to the Sex DiscriminationOrder .He was awarded over £, for hurt feelings and loss of earnings.Niall McMullan from Worthingtons SolicitorsNiall McMullan from Worthingtons Solicitors, who represented Constable Downey, said it was an important ruling.\"This is a signicant ruling by the industrial tribunal, because it has essentially declared that the current PSNI policy is discriminating indirectly against males, in as far as the application of the policy is concerned,\" he said.\"I would like to see serious steps taken by the PSNI in relation to this decision.\"The tribunal were unequivocal in so far as they want the PSNI to review this decision and to ensure it has a less discriminatory effect on not just my client, but all male officers who it is relevant to.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38568793.ece/13a07/AUTOCROP/w620h342/Traffic1.jpg","title":"5000 northern ireland

He was referring to the signed form they submit in order to get their allowance.\"I dont believe in any expenses system its wise to take things absolutely on trust,\" he added.\"Members themselves should be thinking about whether thats a sensible system to convince the public that theyre getting value for money.\" "},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was followed by St Kevins College in Enniskillen in st place with .%, and, both in joint nd place, St Catherines College in Armagh and St Michaels College in Enniskillen with .%.Dalriada School headmaster Tom Skelton said he was \"absolutely delighted\" with the results.\"Its a fantastic achievement for the staff and pupils involved,\" he said. \"To take every child over the line with % five A*-C represents a lot of hard work and the support of parents as well.\"Two years ago we were % as well, so were delighted to get up there again. I think it reflects well on the school, the pupils and the standards set by staff.\"Mr Skelton said the league table \"shows the success of the grammar school system\" and he added: \"Pastoral care is a massive part of it. We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

Foryou know who should hear ya, you know what youd get..pushThose lyrics kept repeating in my head after the summit between An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar and British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson. Nobody was saying much about anything.And the chorus wasnt much better. Take the words of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith, on the meeting: \" I am not going into the details of the negotiations.\" Then Micheal Martin. Leader of Fianna Fail: \" The less said in public, the better!\" And the Taoiseach, in rare harmony, said: \"I wont be going into detail as its sensitive. When in discussions, the less said, the better.\" Read MoreDUP warns PM it wont back any deal that traps us in EUSuzanne Breen: The national embarrassment, everyone agrees we deserve better but no one has the guts to change things Of course, they are talking about Brexit deadlines, deals and the orce that dare not speak its name.In fairness, the mood music around the Merseyside summit was good. It would not have lasted three hours had it not been reasonably constructive.The Taoiseach and Prime Minister appeared to have a good rapport.Personal relationships are important at times of crisis.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetSometimes An Taoiseach is easily flattered and Mr Johnson is well known for his powers of seduction - so the optics come with a heavy qualication. The key is whether both parties feel the same way the morning after the night before.The format of the day was unusual. Meetings occurred between the British and Irish teams, then reduced down to handful of key advisors and both Prime Ministers. This was followed by a brisk walk and some couple time for the two leaders.Much can be lost in translation from such a format. Understandings and undertakings may become blurred. Could it all be a charm offensive to prepare for the blame game  Maybe, but I think not. Johnson needs a deal. As does Leo. And so does Northern Ireland.The morning after and the goodwill seems to have prevailed all the way to Brussels for the meeting between Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay, and EU Chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.The semi news block out is necessary. All too often, careless talk, sniping briefings and megaphone diplomacy has snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.This is not the time to allow the futures of two neighbouring countries, who have joint stewardship of the problem child - Northern Ireland - to have their negotiations dissected and pulled apart by Twitter trolls, jumped up bovver boys, madcap lefties and right wing loonies.There will be nervousness within the DUP ranks. Further pragmatism may be required.They should face up to this because such pragmatism will not change the constitutional position of NI within the UK.It will demonstrate maturity and it delivers on the joint Executive Letter of August , signed by Arlene Foster and the late Martin McGuinness and their stated desire for a soft landing for NI post Brexit.Being mature, leading from the front and not bowing to the lowest common denominator in loyalism would do much to restore the cross-community credibility the DUP lost during the past , days.Johnsons electoral success depends on delivering a Brexit which is recognised as such by voters in Britain. If there is a ranking order for his priorities, it is wherever his votes are. They are not in Northern Ireland, as the Tories hardly register on the Richter scale.The alignment of some in the DUP to the Brexit Party is like hitching a lt on a Catherine wheel, momentarily exciting, all sparks, only to fizzle out like a damp squib.Farage never looks like a man who wants a full-time political job. Post Brexit, his party will disintegrate, as did its predecessor, UKIP.Sinn Feins leadership has been unusually quiet. Mary Lou gave a cautious welcome to the news there was positive vibes coming from the Anglo-Irish summit.When a Brexit deal didnt look at all possible, some in Sinn Fein hoped a crash out of the EU would lead to the type of chaos which would anger nationalist voters. Thus giving a timely lt to a party languishing in the polls in the Republic.The campaign to have a border poll will also stallJohnsons government can pull off the elusive deal.However, the idea of a bespoke NI referendum on the customs union or back stop is a real possibility. That said, every election in Northern Ireland is a quasi border poll.The Tories will never concede on a border poll whilst in hoc to the DUP. The momentum has, for the time being, left any prospect for a border poll years away. Unionists should take comfort in that, too.Deal or no deal - Sinn Fein probably thought they could still make electoral advantage from either outcome.If, and its a huge , a no-deal Brexit is avoided, Sinn Fein will come under huge pressure to go back into the Assembly and restore the Executive. The question is, will they In the meantime, remember For the less you say, the less you hear andanyone asks who told you, then Please dont mention me!"},{"url":null,"title":"snp members reject plan b for securing scottish independence","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a triple-lock mandate for an independence referendum.“What do we benefit from a quadruple-lock mandate, or even a fth or a sixth mandate of continually winning elections when we have a usurper prime minister in Boris Johnson who refuses to accept the democratic mandate of Scotland.“That’s why I support a plan B and I think we should, at the very least, have a debate on it.“You may not agree with the policy of having a plan B, but we are a democratic political party and vibrant political debate is what’s made this party the party that it has been for  years and it’s what got us to government in the first place.”It’s telling that these debates aren’t about how to improve our struggling NHS or our declining education performance, but about how to ide communitiesScotland in Union chief executive Pamela NashHe added: “Plan B isBoris Johnson, an unelected Tory prime minister,he refuses to give Scotland a Section  Order so that we can have the referendum that we have the mandate for, then a pro-independence majority at the next election should be a mandate to enter straight into independence negotiations with the UK Government.”SNP National Secretary, Angus Macleod, said that the conferences committee had already twice considered the resolution, but deemed that it had not been competently drafted.“Clearly,a properly drafted resolution was submitted to the conferences committee, we would consider that for a future conference,” said Mr Macleod.“However, this is not a question of debate, or the possibility of debate, we are always prepared for that in the conference committee and in this party, it is a proud tradition that we have.“It is a question of whether we need competently drafted resolutions on which to have that debate and the committee was not convinced that we do.”Scotland in Union chief executive Pamela Nash said: “This was a direct challenge to Nicola Sturgeon on the conference stage.“The SNP’s splits on how to break up the UK show there is only one priority for the nationalists.“It’s telling that these debates aren’t about how to improve our struggling NHS or our declining education performance, but about how to ide communities.“The SNP will use every vote it receives in the forthcoming general election for its campaign for Scexit.“The only way to grow our economy and protect vital public services for vulnerable Scots is to remain in the UK.”Speaking after the vote by members on the resolution, Mr McEleny said: “I fully accept the decision of conference delegates, who were swayed with the high-profile level of opposition, time will tell whether or not we do need a plan B.“But the day an SNP representative decides not to progress an argument they believe in just because they’re scared it might not be popular is the day we are worse off as a party, so I’m not down-beaten by the outcome and thank all the grassroots independence supporters for their kind words. “"},{"url":null,"title":"us presidential candidate targets facebook policy with false zuckerberg ad","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Critics fear Poland’s illiberal turn could become irreversiblethe party wins another four-year term.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Opposition leader Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonska More than  million voters were choosing lawmakers in the -seat lower house of parliament, the Sejm, and in the -seat Senate.Law and Justice is the first party since the fall of communism to break with the austerity of previous governments, whose free-market policies took a moribund communist economy and transformed it into one of Europe’s most dynamic.However, many Poles were left out in that transformation and inequalities grew, creating grievances. Law and Justice has skilfully addressed those concerns with popular programmes, including one that gives away  zlotysto families per month per child, taking the edge off poverty for some and giving more disposable income to all regardless of wages.“I’m happy because finally, after so many years of communist captivity, we have real professionals in the government,” said Marek Paciorek, a voter in Warsaw who backed Law and Justice.However, critics fear that four more years for Law and Justice will reverse the democratic achievements in this Central European nation. They cite an erosion of judicial independence and of minority rights since the party took power in .Polls over the past week gave Law and Justice between % and % support, with the second-strongest force, the centrist pro-EU Civic Coalition, around %. An alliance of three left-wing parties has polled between % and %.Law and Justice is hoping to win a majority of seats but possible coalition partners,it needs any, could include two small parties, the conservative agrarian Polish People’s Party and Confederation, a far-right group that is openly anti-Semitic and depicts gay people as paedophiles.Law and Justice’s overhaul of the judicial system has given the party unprecedented power over Poland’s prosecution system and courts. In reaction, the European Union has repeatedly warned that the rule of law is threatened and has sanctioned the country, blunting some of the changes, but not all.The ruling party has used taxpayer-funded public media, which is supposed to be nonpartisan, to pump out propaganda hailing the party’s achievements and denigrating political rivals.It also ran a campaign targeting the LGBT movement, depicting it as a grave threat to the nation’s culture and children. Defending the traditional family in a country where most people are Roman Catholics is a message that has found favour with many.Polling stations close at pm local time. Exit polls will be announced then although official results are not expected until early in the week."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8xMFxcXC8xMDE2NDg0N1xcXC9HcmFkZS1BLW9mZmljZS1zcGFjZS1FYnJpbmd0b24ucG5nXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjY0NyxcImhlaWdodFwiOjM0MCxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvY2FjaGUucmVzaXplZC5jb1xcXC9uby1pbWFnZS5wbmdcIixcIm9wdGlvbnNcIjpbXX0iLCJoYXNoIjoiY2RlMmYyZjIyZWUwODc0M2UzZWEzMzJhY2EzNjFmNzA2Mjc2NjA3ZSJ9/grade-a-office-space-ebrington.png","title":"construction ebrington office blocks track commence next month","story":"Construction of Grade A office space at Ebrington is set to commence next month, The Executive Office has confirmed.The buildings will provide ,ft² of office space and are due to open in mid-.

The site involved is located at lands to the north of Waterside Roundabout, above the underground carpark.During the meeting Planning Committee members expressed their view that in this case it was not necessary to seek a hearing in front of the Planning Appeals Commission as the proposal was broadly in line with what had been anticipated on this important regeneration site.While a full quorum was not present to make an official decision on the notice, Council Chief Executive John Kelpie stepped in to officially progress the matter by delegated authority.Planning Officers then wrote to the Department for Infrastructure to formally noty them of the decision to allow the application to move on to the next stage of development.Buildings  googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHowever, while there are plans in place for further development at the site, TEO has told the Derry News that no-one has been identied at present to occupy Buildings   which were recently vacated by Nerve Visual.The Nerve Centre reopened the former Turner Prize gallery space as Nerve Visual in June  when it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.

The popular presenter has a close affinity to the Down side, having been brought up in Burren, and will bring plenty of fun and laughter to the proceedings.Louise Kearney, part of the organising committee, said excitement is building in the area on the countdown to the historic night in the club on Saturday, October .She added: ldquoWe are delighted the Down legends are coming to spend a special evening in our clubrooms.

Curtis McKee, from Maryland Wheelers, would keep James from the top spot of the podium, but only by a mere six seconds.With junior members having set the scene at the cyclocross it was time for the senior team to get on their bikes.In the MTB Support race Mick Foley, fresh back from injury and claiming to be unfit, tore through the mud to claim a top  finish leaving expectations that he can only get better and better.The club had a large representation in the B race which saw  riders competing.It didnrsquot last long for Gibson Chambers as he got caught up in a crash at the start.This left Paul Hamilton taking the honour of first Dromara man home in sixth place, not far behind was Richard Cowan in eighth, Brian Kellett managed to take th and hold off Darren McCann, just.Adi Booth took the bragging rights as he finished ahead of Bryce Hetherington and Mike Barton finishing st, rd and th respectively.

We believe he is still finding out the additional things he can do with his new hand and therersquos still improvements ahead.Mr Moore said Alfie learnt to write with his left hand and still does but there is hope that over time, that he might be able to write and use his prosthesis hand for everything he normally does with his left hand.He says that Alfiersquos classmates and other pupils have accepted the new addition to the P pupil very well.Mr Moore added: ldquoWersquore never have had any problems with other children understanding about Alfie.

It is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Council officials insist that the former police basersquos listed building status is not an impediment to the development of the site and while they concede that preserving the building will be a challenge, it is also presents an opportunity to something exciting with it.The heritage value of the site, which extends as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue, is something council officials are not only keen to preserve, but build upon as they work with the Department for Communities to maximise the potential of the site.The government department, which has already acquired the former PSNI base, is working in partnership with the local authority to help bring new investment to Downpatrick town centre.Leading brands such as Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains, along with several other big names, are keen to invest in Downpatrick, but at present cannot identy suitable accommodation to meet their respective needs.Those behind the Irish Street plan hope that a redevelopment scheme can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses which have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for many years.Councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed confirmation that work on the development brief could be completed shortly.He believes that the transformation of the former police base and adjacent land can provide Downpatrick with a signicant economic boost, creating new retail space and much-needed jobs.Cllr Curran reiterated the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town.He said many will be looking forward to seeing the detail of the development brief and the potential options for a hugely important development site in the heart of Downpatrick.ldquoThere has been no signicant retail investment in the town for quite some time.

Bright finally got their hands on the JFC trophy after a pulsating victory over Aughlisnafin at Pairc Esler on Sunday.Despite having lost the previous six finals they have appeared in, the Ballynoe-based club went into the clash full of confidence and it showed as they broke Aughlisnafinrsquos hearts with an expansive display.The game ebbed and flowed throughout with fortune favouring the brave.Aughlisnafin seized the early initiative before the departure of Mark Stratton to a straight red card threatened to derail their challenge.However, Bright were unable to take real advantage and just when they made their move, Seamas Tumelty joined Stratton for an early shower.The game opened up at this stage with Bright showing a greater composure to prevent Aughlisnafin from completing the double in a thrilling finale to the game.Oran Flanagan and Cailean Toner exchanged early scores in a positive opening to the game before a long range point from the impressive Adam Garland and a good effort from Shane McCann sent the lsquoFin into a - to - lead by the sixth minute.The action was hot and heavy all over the park, but Stratton saw red in the th minute and Bright took full advantage.Sam Dinu reduced the deficit to a single point before the accurate Flanagan converted a free to restore the lsquoFinrsquos two-point lead.Dinu and Breannain McComiskey swapped scores before two Flanagan frees stretched Aughlisnafinrsquos lead to four points, despite being down to  men.Kyran Smythrsquos side held on grimly to the lsquoFinrsquos coat tails and just before the break Gareth George helped breathe new le into Brightrsquos challenge when he pointed from a rsquo to leave his side trailing - to - at half-time.The second half was in its infancy when Bright lay down their marker.A blistering spell of attacking football yielded unanswered points from Declan Trainor, Kevin Groves and the ubiquitous George to draw level.There was only one team in it at this stage, but Bright went and shot themselves in the foot when Tumelty fell foul of the referee and was shown the red card.Brightrsquos heads were now down and Flanagan punished the indiscretion when he pointed the lsquoFin into a - to - lead after  minutes.Smyth sent for the cavalry at this stage and it duly arrived in the shape of Matt McKiernan.The rangy forward was on hand to steer the ball past Calum Croskery and when Toner quickly tagged on a point, Bright suddenly and from nowhere, were three points clear, - to -.Driven on remorselessly by Donagh Steele, Aughlisnafin battled back and points from Sean Fitzsimmons and two from Flanagan had it all square again with  minutes gone.The game was still being played at a hectic pace and with  minutes gone, Garland pointed the lsquoFin into a deserved, but precarious - to - lead.Dinu held his nerve to level matters, but Aughlisnafin went back in front thanks to a point from Shea Croskery. Corey Ranaghan quickly levelled matters, but that man Croskery gave his side a - to - lead with less than eight minutes remaining.Fingernails were being bitten to the quick as Bright went in search of the equaliser and it arrived less than a minute later via a Kevin Groves free.It was now a case of who dares wins as the game hurtled to a conclusion and points from George, Dinu and Matthew Burns had Bright literally home and hosed.Aughlisnafin refused to capitulate and they knew that only a goal would do, but all they could muster in added time was a point from Flanagan as Bright held on for an historic win.Bright: Michael Farrand, Barry Mageean, Marc Burke, Seamas Tumelty, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Nicholas OrsquoConnor, Jack McLaughlin, Corey Ranaghan , Cailean Toner , Sam Dinu , Kevin Groves , Declan Trainor , Owen McEvoy, Gareth George , Rian Tempany.

The exercise is expected to take around  months to complete.Council officials will examine each community centre in detail with the exercise looking at the population they serve, the number of young people in their area, crime statistics andthe facilities are located in so-called neighbourhood renewal areas.One area the review will examine will be Crossgar where local people are keen to see new community centre provided.A major feasibility study was carried out a number of years ago with a site adjacent to St Colmcillersquos High School in the village identied as the preferred location for a new community and sports centre. While a new facility was never constructed, the forthcoming review will examinethe need for it remains.The idea of the community centre probe is to determine potential under provision and where new facilities may be required moving forward.Council officials will also look to seethere is over provision in any areas but insist there are no plans to close any existing centres. They argue that the main driver is about increasing and improving community provision across the district.While itrsquos still early days, council officials say they will work through the process over the next year and will keep ratepayers fully informed about consultation meetings which will be held across all seven district electoral areas to ensure everyone has an opportunity to have their say.Described as a ldquosignicant piece of work, the review will also include discussions with community groups and associations.Insisting that the review is not about closing community centres, council officials say the examination of current provision will focus on where they are located and local need. And they have suggested that the exercise could potentially throw up issues which surfaced during the playground strategy which resulted in some play parks amalgamating.Council officials say while the intention is not to close any centres at this stage, the review will focus on potential gaps in current provision to help form strategic decisions about where to build new centresthis is required.The review will also examine which community centres may require refurbishment and potential extensions to allow them to meet increasing demand.Council officials have confirmed that a number of the districtrsquos community centres are part-funded by the Department for Communities with a number also run by local groups and associations.Ahead of the community centre review, council officials have been conducting an exercise looking at the user figures and the number of programmes that the respective centres deliver. Part of the forthcoming review will also take a critical look at funding streams to help increase centre usage.Council officials say the parks and open spaces strategy will identy those that need upgraded and those which are not necessarily adding any value. It will examine those that can be improved with the review rolled out over the next  months.When the community centre and parks and open spaces review has been completed, initial reports will be debated by the local authorityrsquos Active and Health Communities Committee which will then make recommendations to the full councilto agree a new strategy moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C October 9%2C 1979  ","story":"STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash Police have still not recovered the body of the second man drowned on a fishing trip to Strangford Lough at the weekend.At Downpatrick police station mdash from where the search operation was co-ordinated mdash police say there is no hope that  year-old Carrickfergus man, Mr John Craig, is still alive.They believe that Mr Craigrsquos body has been swept out into the Irish Sea and search has now been stretched to the Isle of Man.Mr Craig went in a -foot fibre glass cabin cruiser to fish for mackerel bait on Saturday afternoon, along with with Peter Johnson , from Woodcroft Rise, Braniel, Belfast.In the early hours of Sunday morning police were alerted by the relatives of the two men, anxious that neither had ed.

No one player has a bigger or more important job than anyone .They are in this together and they have an unfaltering belief in their own ability and work on the motto thatyou fail to prepare, prepare to fail.Martin McCourt has dislodged the experienced Niall Kane in goal for the last few games and could well hold on to the number one spot for the final.One thing for certain, bar injury, is that the five Branagan brothers will start, four in defence, with Eugene lining out at corner forward, but given a licence to roam.They epitomise everything good about Kilcoo. Honest, resolute, determined and committed.Ryan McEvoy, Dylan Ward and Aaron Morgan should be tasked with winning the ball in the middle of the park and supplying Paul Devlin, Conor Laverty and the Johnston brothers Ryan and Jerome mdash not forgetting younger brother Shealan when he is called upon.Kilcoo also have serious strength on the bench and in addition to Johnston the younger, they can call on Anthony Morgan, Paddy Devlin, Sean OHanlon, James McClean and Felim McGreevy,.Warrenpoint have made their way through some tricky ties unbeaten and along the way have accounted for An Riocht , Ballyholland , Longstoneand Ballyholland in the semi-final, - to -.Manager Niall McAleenan has the nucleus of the squad that won the IFC title in  and has also introduced some talented teenagers.He will rely on Adam Lynch, Pat Murdock, Ryan McAleenan, John Boyle, Eoghan Byrne and Ciaran McCartan to keep the Kilcoo attack quiet, bit few defences ever manage it.The Point cant afford to play in a defensive manner come Sunday.

The key issue we have to address is the presence of a wet weather centre in the resort which I would suggest includes a fun-type family pool, he said.ldquoI believe that alongside this there needs to be a few swimming lanes to accommodate the needs of local people who have not had access to modern leisure facilities for some considerable time.Cllr Clarke said this issue needed to be flagged up as part of the consultation process on the way forward.He said it was important that elected representatives highlighted the needs of local people during the process.ldquoWe are talking about a once in a generation opportunity to deliver a modern leisure facility in Newcastle and we will not be settling for less. The location is good and while there may be issues with parking, these are not insurmountable.ldquoWe are talking about a complete new build which will maximise the large area of space at the rear of the existing centre and I would be keen to see a high quality design, comprising wood and glass, he said.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoI would like to see an eco-friendly building, which is both sustainable and carbon neutral..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Planners.jpg","title":"Planners recommend expansion at Newcastle’s Barbican supermarket  ","story":"A LEADING Newcastle business is in line for a major extension.Planners are recommending that mdash subject to a number of conditions mdash an amended proposal to expand the Barbican filling station at the Dundrum Road in the resort should be given the green light.The approval recommendation is due to be discussed at a meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Planning Committee on Wednesday of next week.The proposal includes the redevelopment of the existing petrol station and forecourt and extending the storersquos retail space.

","story":"BALLYNAHINCH shook off their insipid displays in the SONI Premiership to push much-fancied Terenure right to the wire in their first appearance back in AIL Division A since .The Dublin outfit were the form team over the second half of last season and having recently clinched the Leinster Senior League title, were heavy favourites with pundits and bookmakers prior to kick off.They were also almost at full strength, while the home side were patched up in midfield after losing Rory Butler to injury. Veteran centre Stuart Morrow was again pressed into service with Aaron Cairns ing on the wing following concussion.Up front Ben Cullen earned the starting loose head spot and hugely influential number  Conall Boomer ed from injury. However, with eight players involved in the Ulster A Celtic Cup game on Friday night and four more in South Africa with the Pro squad, Brian McLaughlinrsquos options were limited.Tom Stewart and Connor Rankin were released to take their places on the bench, but the team that took the field was largely drawn from the squad which had been under-performing over the pre-AIL period.A few honest words on Tuesday night and an exceptional week on the training paddock clearly made a big dference as the home side tore into their opponents from the whistle.Playing away from the clubhouse and into the wet and gusty conditions, they drove into the Terenure half and were rewarded for an excellent scrum with a penalty to allow Sean OrsquoHagan to give his side the lead.Some indiscipline from a visibly fired up home forward pack allowed Terenure the chance to gain a foothold in the home half, but a superb turnover from Boomer on former lsquoHinch prop Campbell Classon allowed Ryan Wilson to clear.Cairns was doing his best to keep the home support involved and after skinning his opposite number twice in quick succession, he proceeded to drive him almost into the home dugout with a massive hit which got the home crowd even more fired up.However, a three point lead was scant reward for Ballynahinch after  minutes and Terenure began to turn the screw.They had a clear scrum advantage with referee Kieran Barry taking umbrage with Cullenrsquos angles and following a scrum deep in lsquoHinch territory, they went through the phases and eventually drove prop Liam Hyland over for a try at the posts to take a - lead.Moments later a superb long grubber kick forced Cairns back over his own line and Terenure won another penalty from the resulting m scrum.Declining the shot at goal they opted for another scrum and another infringement led to a penalty try, taking the lead out to - after  minutes.Undaunted, Ballynahinch finished the half strongly when a trademark Rhys OrsquoDonnell show and go sent him flying up the left touchline and almost over in the corner. Stout defending from Terenure averted the immediate danger, but a penalty for offside allowed OrsquoHagan to kick another penalty and cut the gap to - at half-time.As conditions worsened there was belief around the ground that this was not an insurmountable deficit, but disaster struck early in the first half when replacement Rankin elected to move the ball from deep.His long pass to a flying Ross Adair was only inches off target, but allowed the prolic Jake Swaine to hack through and win the race for the line to take his side  points clear at -. Ballynahinch refused to lie down and used the conditions to dominate field position.Blindside Aaron Hall put his injury nightmare behind by driving Terenure back at every opportunity and OrsquoHaganrsquos deadly boot dragged them back into the game with two penalties. When the under pressure Terenure outfit conceded another penalty in their own , almost everyone in the ground expected another three points.The ever-alert OrsquoDonnell had other ideas as he took a quick tap penalty and weaved his way over to score at the posts.OrsquoHaganrsquos conversion made it  all and as the weather really closed in, the home side were the clear favourites as they piled on the pressure in search of a win.Terenure defended well and were handed a leline when Cairns elected to run a speculative clearance instead of launching it back downfield.The ball was knocked on in the centre of the pitch and with heavyweight lock James Simpson off, the field Terenure once again exploited their scrum superiority to milk a penalty.Swaine held his nerve to nail the kick which, although central, was made tricky by the grim conditions.Ballynahinch threw everything at a tiring Terenure defence as the game entered injury time and after more than  phases of hammering away around the m line OrsquoHagan called for thegoal.The slippery conditions and heavy pressure meant his kick was a little rushed and it dropped short and wide to allow the away side to mark the ball and kick it out for a hard-earned win.The locals will reflect on a game they probably should have won, but will take an enormous amount of positives from the performance after visibly stepping up their physicality.Small margins will make a huge dference in this league and the fixtures come fast over the next few weeks. lsquoHinch travel to UCC this weekend to take on a student side buoyed by their demolition of much-fancied Trinity at the weekend and with the squad still thin due to Ulster Arsquos involvement in the Celtic Cup final, skipper John Donnan will have to lt his men for another big effort. However, he will be a happier man after his team showed that they belong in this company.Ballynahinch: Ben Cullen, Conor Piper, Johnny Blair, James Simpson, John Donnan , Aaron Hall, Olly Loughead, Conall Boomer, Rhys OrsquoDonnell, Sean OrsquoHagan, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Stuart Morrow, George Pringle, Ross Adair.

Language is what makes the heart audible. We had a teacher who came to our primary school and taught me the meaning of my name. Gorm is the Irish word for blue. Gorman were the people whose hair was so black it had a blue sheen off it. I thought, ‘wow’. I was about nine, I wanted to find out more. “I started to learn Irish, I went away on summer courses. It’s important to me.“I understand that there are people from the same bit of ground as I am who speak Ulster-Scots to whom that is equally important. I wanted to find out more.“My dad would have used Ulster-Scots expressions at home before I realised what they were. He’d say things like ‘red up’ and called us gaunches, or better, carnaptious gaunches. One of my favourite words in any language is the word ‘thran’.”For the programme Damian s to the Ards peninsula as he tries to understand why, for so many people, Ulster-Scots and its literary heritage is still important and relevant today. He reconnects with Hugh Robinson, who helped him start a writers’ group there, and spends time with native speakers and scholars including Carole Gilmore and Elaine McFeeters.Of the Irish language act which has seen red lines drawn at Stormont, and the limited use of Ulster-Scots in the Province, Damian said: “In our part of the world there are dficult conversations still to be had and that being the case I just think we need all the language we can get.”In his spare time Damian teaches conversational English to a group of Syrian refuges in Wales: “As has been pointed out to me I’ve passed on quite a bit of Ulster–Scots. There are people from Aleppo and Homs who are running round Aberystwyth using words like ‘red up’ and ‘carnaptious’.”Huge interest in new book on RHI scandal by Sam McBrideLatest update from criminal cases heard at Portsmouth Magistrates Court Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingF**k the Pope and the I.R.A. -

You spend time with the bride and you spend time talking about things, but you don’t think of Joe Public having an opinion.’’HRH Duchess of Cambridge’s bouquet was small and subtle, dominated by whites and a little greenery.‘‘Everything was British, everything was seasonal and everything was from the Royal estate. ‘‘She had Lily of the Valley, a little touch of hyacinth, because in the language of flowers they symbolise the constancy of love and we thought that was a nice message, and she had some Sweet William, which was a bit fun.’’Shane was also responsible for the avenue of trees in Westminster Abbey - field maples and hornbeams.‘‘Nature decided that the trees weren’t going to be blossom trees that they were going to be green trees, because it was a really hot spring that year, so we were not in control of that. ‘‘The Duchess of Cambridge didn’t mind at all, luckily. I’ve had brides hyperventilate over the shade of pink, never mind to suddenly tell somebody, by the way, you’re not going to have blossom. She was fine, she said ‘oh well, that’s great’. She was a very calm bride.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

This is a signicant increase from the current figure of % and is said to be a \"world leading level, ensuring maximum value from wind and other sources\". To achieve this, it is expected that the amount of renewable energy connected to the grid will need to double by . At the moment, approximately  MW of renewable energy is connected to the NI power system. SONI managing director Jo Aston said that the strategy was a \"direct response to the climate crisis and the UK Governments commitment to zero net carbon emissions by \" “To do this we must innovate for the next generation while ensuring today’s electricity users have a reliable, secure and cost-effective supply,” she said.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years.

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
