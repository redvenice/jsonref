The army, it turned out, didn’t march on its ordnance so much as its adrenal glands, juiced up by a steady supply of five cups of caffeine a day. Immediately though there’s a stumble, something that requires us to push beyond this “interesting facts” approach to history. For while the Union side was fighting to end slavery, the coffee that it gulped down was the product of a South American plantation system as brutal as anything you might find in the cotton fields of Mississippi. In Brazil, which is where most of the Yankees’ five-a-day came from, slavery would not be legally abolished for another quarter of a century.It’s this conundrum of connectedness that lies at the heart of Coffeeland, Augustine Sedgewick’s energising study of how an everyday commodity has ploughed up the world’s surface and hacked deep into its economic and political design. His analysis goes far beyond those “commodity biographies” that were so popular two decades ago, the ones with one-word titles like Cod, Salt or Paper. Coffeeland is a data-rich piece of original research that shows in compelling detail how coffee capitalism has delivered both profit and pain, comfort and terror to different people at different times over the past 200 years. Sometimes the impacts are speedy and legible: a surge in demand for cheap coffee from the US to keep its blue-collar workforce alert requires labourers in the southern hemisphere to forgo sleep as they pick and pluck around the clock. On other occasions the time lag between cause and effect is lengthy, while the geography remains concise. The Marxist revolution of the 1930s in El Salvador, Sedgewick suggests, can be traced back to changes in landholding patterns that were imposed by the government 80 years earlier.This could all feel dauntingly abstract, but Sedgwick’s great achievement is to clothe macroeconomics in warm, breathing flesh. At the heart of his book lies the story of James Hill, a textile salesman from the Manchester backstreets who shipped out to central America in 1889 and ended up as the undisputed “coffee king” of El Salvador. By the time of his death in 1951, Hill ruled an archipelago of 18 plantations, comprising 2,500 acres and employing up to 5,000 people. His annual profit ran into hundreds of thousands of dollars.Behind James Hill’s great success was a simple thought experiment. What if he could export the ruthless culture of “Cottonopolis”, the nickname given to industrialising Manchester in the 1850s, to the lackadaisical rural landscape he had found in El Salvador? His attention was particularly fixed on the extravagantly fertile soil around the Santa Ana volcano, where coffee was grown by the local Indians on communally held land before being traded in dribs and drabs. Hill used bank loans to buy a tract of prime coffee real estate and then, following a script that sounds like it comes straight from Samuel Smiles’s 1859 classic Self-Help, he parlayed his initial investment into an agribusiness, which he ran along the lines of a Lancashire cotton mill. The native smallholders who had been thrown off their land had no choice but to work for Hill as waged labourers, required henceforth to run their lives not according to their custom or convenience but to the factory clock.Sedgewick is deft at demonstrating how geo-economics and personal history combined to produce Hill’s lucky break. In the early 1880s a blight on coffee trees across Asia created a global scarcity that opened up a space for Central American planters to wedge their way into the increasingly lucrative market. But Hill would not have spotted the opportunity – or exploited the situation – had he not grown up as part of the world’s first industrial proletariat. Scuttling around the Ancoats district of Manchester as a lad had allowed him to observe how a clever man without formal education or social contacts might impose his will on the world, not to mention exploit its natural resources, if only he had a sliver of capital and rock solid self-belief.More practically, Hill had picked up the Manchester men’s trick of using hunger to lick a workforce into shape. The Truck Shop system, by which cotton workers were paid in tokens that could only be exchanged for food at the factory shop, had long been banned in Britain. But in El Salvador there was nothing to stop Hill adapting the principle by paying his workforce partly in cash and partly in tortilla and beans. He also ruthlessly uprooted any other food stuffs that sprung up accidentally among his coffee trees – self-seeding tomatoes, avocados, plantains and figs – to ensure that no one managed to assuage their hunger on the sly. If you wanted to eat, then you had no choice but to come to work at Los Tres Puertas and pile up as many beans as you could balance on your strictly rationed two tortillas.At times, Hill seems like a pantomime villain, but Sedgewick is keen that we understand his methods as an expression not of moral dereliction but intellectual inquiry. New ideas were circulating about how the body’s biological economy could be made to fit with the larger network of profit and loss. Or, to put it another way, plenty of clever economists were wondering whether it was possible to calculate the minimum number of calories required to feed a worker in order to be sure of harvesting a sufficient amount of labour.So committed was Hill to creating a frictionless system in which no energy leaked out that when he heard his workers laughing he knew something had gone wrong. It wasn’t that they were enjoying themselves that upset him so much as the fact that they were wasting oxygen and energy that, technically speaking, belonged to him. If they wanted to giggle, they could do it in their own time using their own air.Yet, as Sedgewick makes clear in a particularly wonderful passage, the workers of Los Tres Puertas refused to be reduced to economic units. They found plenty of time to laugh, love, help their neighbours, get extra food for their children, and, above all, do “things that steam engines cannot do”. One of those things was to wonder whether there wasn’t a better way for life to be organised. When coffee prices collapsed during the Great Depression a protest labour movement was mobilised by communist leaders into full-blown revolution.It was not, as it turned out, the beginning of a new way of doing things. For the rest of the 20th century El Salvador teetered between dictatorship and revolution, right the way through to the blistering Salvadorian civil war of the 1980s. In 1978, Hill’s grandson was kidnapped and held for a multimillion dollar ransom. Sedgewick is too subtle to bang the point home, but by this time in the narrative an alert reader will have picked up the hint: Hill’s profiteering interventions in the Salvadorian economy a century earlier had led to this, a terrified middle-aged businessman face-down under a green tarp in the back of a pick-up. Thankfully, the grandson survived, but the central question in this excellent book remains: “What does it mean to be connected to faraway people and places through everyday things?”• Coffeeland: A History by Augustine Sedgewick is published by Penguin (£25)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0531c0fc2d57bac157ad7f6d0fd8c1abf27b13f1/0_252_3352_2011/master/3352.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee897d86f3efb553d9a02af813ba0b20","title":"ministry of truth dorian lynskey nineteen eighty four orwell prize longlist","story":"Dorian Lynskey’s The Ministry of Truth is among the contenders for the political writing award named after the dystopian classic’s authorDorian Lynskey’s “biography” of George Orwell’s dystopian masterpiece Nineteen Eighty-Four has made it on to the longlist for the Orwell prize for political writing.Set up by the Orwell Foundation, the £3,000 prize is intended to reward those books that best meet Orwell’s ambition “to make political writing into an art”. Lynskey’s The Ministry of Truth, which traces the origins of Nineteen Eighty-Four to the time Orwell spent fighting on the republican side in the Spanish civil war, is up against 11 other titles. These include  journalist Amelia Gentleman’s exposé The Windrush Betrayal, Caroline Criado Perez’s Invisible Women, about the gender data gap, and the poet Kate Clanchy’s memoir of life as a teacher, Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me.“None of us are thinking about life in quite the same way as we were even a few weeks ago. Politics looks and feels very different too,” admitted head of Bloomberg Economics and chair of judges Stephanie Flanders.“But the books on this year’s longlist are not about ordinary politics. In fact, most aren’t about mainstream politics at all. They are, though, political in the most important sense: they cast fresh light on something that matters and perhaps inspire us to consider how things might be better.”Also in the running for the prize are Julia Lovell’s Maoism: A Global History, Robert Macfarlane’s journey to the world beneath our feet, Underland, and Azadeh Moaveni’s investigation into the women of Islamic State, Guest House for Young Widows.Flanders added that all 12 books were also “a good and satisfying read … We surely need those more than ever.”The longlist for the £3,000 Orwell prize for political fiction was also announced on Wednesday, ranging from Lucy Ellmann’s Ducks, Newburyport, a stream of consciousness from a middle-aged woman in Ohio, to Bernardine Evaristo’s Booker-winning Girl, Woman, Other and Attica Locke’s Heaven, My Home, in which a black Texas Ranger investigates the disappearance of a white supremacist’s son. Nine of the 13 longlisted titles are written by women.Chair of judges for the fiction prize, Jude Kelly, said the lineup “pays homage to the ability of the writer’s voice to absorb political power structures and return them to us in stories of personal identity, community tensions, how the long tail of history impacts on the present, and the emerging strength of women to define what ‘political’ means.”The shortlists will be announced in mid-May, with the winners to be revealed on 25 June, Orwell’s birthday.Appeasing Hitler: Chamberlain, Churchill and the Road to War by Tim Bouverie (Bodley Head)Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me by Kate Clanchy (Picador)Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men by Caroline Criado Perez (Chatto \u0026amp Windus)The Windrush Betrayal: Exposing the Hostile Environment by Amelia Gentleman ( Faber)Follow Me, Akhi: The Online World of British Muslims by Hussein Kesvani (Hurst)Maoism: A Global History by Julia Lovell (Bodley Head)The Ministry of Truth: A Biography of George Orwell’s 1984 by Dorian Lynskey (Picador)Underland: A Deep Time Journey by Robert Macfarlane (Hamish Hamilton)Guest House for Young Widows: Among the Women of Isis by Azadeh Moaveni (Scribe)Margaret Thatcher – Herself Alone: The Authorised Biography Vol Three by Charles Moore (Allen Lane)Kremlin Winter: Russia and the Second Coming of Vladimir Putin by Robert Service (Picador)The Age of Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff (Profile)This Paradise by Ruby Cowling (Boiler House Press)Ducks, Newburyport by Lucy Ellmann (Galley Beggar Press)Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo (Hamish Hamilton)The Wall by John Lanchester (Faber \u0026amp Faber)The Topeka School by Ben Lerner (Granta)The Man Who Saw Everything by Deborah Levy (Hamish Hamilton)Heaven, My Home by Attica Locke (Serpent’s Tail)To Calais, in Ordinary Time by James Meek (Canongate)Girl by Edna O’Brien (Faber \u0026amp Faber)The Travelers by Regina Porter (Jonathan Cape)Broken Jaw by Minoli Salgado (The 87 Press)Spring by Ali Smith (Hamish Hamilton)The Nickel Boys by Colson Whitehead (Fleet)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bba81f8dc2279ff23a099beccef6d0fe457cd0f6/268_0_4458_2675/master/4458.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fc96534b34bf5df9aa020f5d62753a4","title":"airlines lobby to rewrite carbon deal due to coronavirus","story":"Industry says it is not trying to dodge obligations but that it is a ‘matter of survival’Airlines are lobbying to rewrite the rules of a global agreement designed to tackle aviation emissions, with the coronavirus outbreak expected to make its targets tougher to meet.Campaigners accused airlines of attempting to “dodge their obligations”, but the industry said it was “a matter of survival”, with most international travel currently frozen in the Covid-19 crisis.The International Air Transport Association (Iata) has called on the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to amend the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation (Corsia), or risk airlines pulling out.Under the system, airlines have to pay to offset any growth in carbon emissions above a baseline set by the average emissions of 2019 and 2020. The grounding of aircraft during the pandemic means the baseline will be far lower than envisaged, and the carbon targets much more challenging, if Corsia goes ahead without changes.Iata has told ICAO that the baseline “must be adjusted to ensure the sustainable development of international aviation and avoid an inappropriate economic burden on the sector”. It said some nations could pull out of the agreement if the costs were too high.Before the Covid-19 crisis, estimates showed that airlines were likely to have to spend between £4bn and £18bn a year globally on carbon credits by 2035 to satisfy the Corsia rules. A report by the Green Alliance, before the coronavirus lockdown, found that this was not enough to meet the goals set out in the Paris agreement.The ICAO council had signed off on the Corsia plans on 13 March, gaining plaudits from green campaigners for sticking with its pledges on the climate crisis instead of shelving them in the face of the pandemic. However, airlines’ commitment now looks distinctly shaky.The US Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), a long-time mover behind the Corsia scheme, argued that the existing Corsia rules allowed enough flexibility for governments to address the “suppressed activity in 2020, without any need to renegotiate the measure in a drawn-out political discussion”.“If Corsia is amended, it must be done in a way which also strengthens its ambition, with targets to limit and reduce actual emissions levels.”Greenpeace UK’s executive director, John Sauven, said: “At the same time as they’re asking for huge government bailouts, airlines are also lobbying furiously to dodge their obligations towards cutting carbon emissions.“Offsetting schemes have always been big polluters’ favourite excuse to carry on polluting while shifting responsibility for their emissions to someone else. The industry’s current proposal would only make the buck-passing easier.”Iata denied that it was backing away from Corsia. Its director general, Alexandre de Juniac, said: “We haven’t given up our environmental goals … After the recovery we will continue to reduce emissions and noise footprints – that hasn’t changed.“This crisis is a matter of survival for the industry … We are asking governments for urgent help. Of course we will comply with our environmental obligations. Before that, we have to survive – or there will be no issue with the environment, the industry will have disappeared.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56dc84e040d5688827797044b155d5fa87103a15/0_229_5628_3377/master/5628.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efbf5c5a9b0e31c985037634b836aa83","title":"fashion industry reels as coronavirus shuts shops and cancels orders","story":"The coronavirus pandemic has plunged the $2.5tn (£2tn) global fashion industry into crisis with a “significant number” of firms expected to go bust in the next 18 months, putting millions of jobs at risk.Even before the outbreak began, stiff competition meant that more than half of the companies in McKinsey’s benchmark global fashion index were described as “value destroyers” – meaning the profit made by a company did not exceed its cost of capital.“The pandemic spells more trouble for this group, which includes department store giants, high street brands and venture-backed startups,” the report states. “We expect a large number of global fashion companies to go bankrupt in the next 12 to 18 months.”With a global workforce of more than 300m people the virus has triggered a terrible domino effect.

However, Russ Mould, an investment director at AJ Bell, said Prudential may still bow to public pressure. “In general, there’s some public and political perception that companies need to be more careful with their cash and make sure they can withstand more difficult times ahead.“It seems likely Legal \u0026amp General, looking more and more the outlier, will have to follow suit.”The Bank’s Prudential Regulation Authority, which is in charge of financial stability in the UK, said it welcomed the decision from some insurers to pause idends, given the economic uncertainty.It said: “When insurers are considering whether or not to proceed with any idend payments, their boards should pay close attention to the need to protect policyholders and maintain safety and soundness. Decisions regarding capital or significant risk management issues need to be informed by a range of scenarios, including very severe ones.”William Ryder, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that while insurers such as RSA and Direct Line would be well-capitalised in normal circumstances, “the coming months are not going to be normal”.He said: “It’s worth remembering that the bailout of American insurer AIG was a key moment in the 2008 financial crisis, and we can’t risk a loss of confidence in the industry now. We understand, therefore, why the regulator isn’t comfortable leaving it to management to assess their capacity to pay a idend.”Admiral, Phoenix and Prudential declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bc9bbc85e684a0dd721cec63e98043fb1a3ea76/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70984c85b41516f703421c0614e2ba8f","title":"uk agency loses case against ex kazakh president family aliyev nazarbayev","story":"Judge overturns unexplained wealth orders that led to freezing of London propertiesBritain’s National Crime Agency has lost a high court attempt to force the daughter and grandson of a former president of Kazakhstan to explain where they got the money to buy £80m of property in London.Last year, the NCA froze three of the family’s properties, including a mansion on north London’s so-called Billionaire’s Row with an underground swimming pool and cinema, over claims they were acquired using proceeds from unlawful activity.The agency used unexplained wealth orders (UWOs), a power introduced in 2018 known as “McMafia” laws after the BBC’s organised crime drama and book that inspired it, to freeze the assets until the owner explains the source of their wealth. This case is only the second time such an order has been used in Britain.On Wednesday, a high court judge granted an appeal by the family against the orders.The NCA said it would appeal against the decision.One of the properties, a mansion in Hampstead, is occupied by Nurali Aliyev, the grandson of former Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev, and his wife and children.The two other properties frozen are an apartment in Chelsea, south-west London, which the campaign group Transparency International says is worth £31m, and a house in Highgate, north London.The NCA has barred any attempt to sell the properties and argues that the wealth used to buy them was linked to Rakhat Aliyev – Nurali Aliyev’s father and the former president’s son-in-law – who was found hanged in an Austrian jail in 2015 after being charged with the murder of two bankers in 2007.“UWOs are new legislation and we always expected there would be significant legal challenge over their use,” said Graeme Biggar, the NCA’s director general of the National Economic Crime Centre.“We disagree with this decision to discharge the UWOs and will be filing an appeal. We have been very clear that we will use all the legislation at our disposal to pursue suspected illicit finance and we will continue to do so.”The ultimate beneficial owners of the three properties — Rakhat Aliyev’s ex-wife, Dariga Nazarbayeva, the chair of the senate in Kazakhstan and daughter of the former Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev, and her son, Nurali Aliyev — applied to the high court to discharge the UWOs.Giving judgment remotely on Wednesday, Mrs Justice Lang overturned all three UWOs, ruling that “the NCA’s assumption” that Rakhat Aliyev was the source of the funds to purchase the three properties was unreliable.The judge said there was “cogent evidence” that Nazarbayeva and Nurali Aliyev had founded the companies that owned the properties and provided the funds to purchase them.“The court’s powerful judgment demonstrates the NCA obtained the orders on an inaccurate basis as part of a flawed investigation which was entirely without merit,” said Nurali Aliyev.Britain’s first UWOs were issued against assets belonging to Jahangir Hajiyev, who was in prison in Azerbaijan for embezzlement from the state bank, and his wife, Zamira, who spent £16.3m in the London department store Harrods. She lost her appeal against the order this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c8add6ec32bbdd220aa098aef0c86ec140eaa5a/0_189_5677_3407/master/5677.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25a43a35d739746e407b23c52d68fdc7","title":"business supermarkets government rishi sunak coronavirus","story":"Rishi Sunak should heed the coronavirus response in Wales, where small businesses and charities have taken priorityThe financial package put together by the Treasury is enormous and unprecedented, with the government setting aside an additional £250bn in contingency this year. Although the sudden switch to large-scale deficit spending has caused anxiety among some conservatives, so far the policies have enjoyed widespread support.However, government should not lose sight of the need for its policies to be seen to be fair. A good start would be to avoid handing out significant amounts of money to companies that simply don’t need the cash – especially when so many smaller firms are struggling to get access to government support and going out of business.No one can deny that the supermarkets are doing an amazing job of keeping the nation supplied. Their workers are putting themselves at risk every day, many earning less than those who are being paid to stay at home. The enormous shift in social habits that has taken place in a matter of days will be putting huge pressure on management, supply teams and other core functions. According to this week’s stock market update, Tesco has recruited 45,000 new staff in thepast two weeks. Rightly, we need to thank all working in the industry. Their work really is key.Last week people were outraged by the fact that businesses owned by billionaires such as Philip and Tina Green were seeking government support, even though they have been forced to reduce operations. A £3bn handout to companies seeing booming trade could be even harder to justify.To some extent, these kinds of outcomes will be unavoidable. The scale and speed of the response demanded by the crisis means that the government simply doesn’t have the time to think through all the consequences of its actions. But as the facts emerge, it should be able to refine policy choices to ensure fair outcomes.In Wales, where the administration does not have unlimited powers to borrow or print money, the government has reversed its decision to match business rates relief in England and is excluding the largest premises from accessing the relief. It plans to ert the savings (which it claims will amount to £120m) to help smaller businesses and charities. It has been reported that Tesco has launched a “huge lobbying operation” in order to get the Welsh government’s decision overturned – an effort described as “disproportionate” by officials.The government’s efforts to keep businesses afloat should be welcomed. But some of the oversights, such as handouts to companies who have not been detrimentally affected, should be addressed. At a minimum, companies that do well could be asked to do more to support their staff or their communities though erting any government support they receive to food banks or to increases in staff pay.An alternative approach could be for the government to introduce an excess profit tax to claw back any exceptional gains made by companies during the crisis.What businesses should not be doing is complaining about having support removed when there appears to be no reasonable justification for subsidy – particularly at a time that the public sector is experiencing a significant amount of pressure. Corporate lobbyists seeking handouts for the few companies set to do well from the crisis is one sector that could do with a period of furlough right now.• George Turner is director of the thinktank Tax Watch UK"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47f777cd0839d08830e848ed876a58a9845dc9c9/0_120_4144_2487/master/4144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49df17fb91560fb317a5fda2ff963cf1","title":"india leaders coronavirus lockdown","story":"Sudden and strict coronavirus lockdowns have hit the poor hardest – no wonder workers are deserting the citiesMiramar beach sprawls desolate outside my home in Panjim, the capital of Goa. April is the domestic tourist season in India’s smallest state, usually characterised by crowds. I’m accustomed to winding through masses of people at sunset. But now there’s almost no one.In Goa, things started badly. We’d already been in curfew for three days. The administration reassured citizens – the most affluent and best-educated in India – that supplies would never be disrupted. But everything shut down nonetheless. The hashtag #GoaStarving spread on social media, as civil society scrambled to stave off disaster. Only then did instructions come from New Delhi to reopen grocery stores.Just across the river from me in the hamlet of Penha de França, the Harvard Medical School professor Vikram Patel was caught up in the melee. Along with his neighbours, he was assaulted by the police while queueing to buy provisions. He spoke of “the constantly changing announcements on social restrictions, the abandonment of government responsibility to secure supply chains, the threatening of desperate people with military-style responses, and the crushing of small businesses which define rural life in Goa”. These were the decisions of panicked politicians. Planned and phased reactions, he told me, would have been much less disruptive and damaging.The tumult in Goa was only a microcosm of the rest of the country. Just over 4,900 Covid-19 infections (and 137 deaths) have been registered since India’s first case on 30 January, but numbers pale in comparison to tuberculosis, which has killed hundreds of thousands of Indians every year for decades, without triggering any draconian curfews. Patel pointed out that this astonishing death toll had never occasioned any panic. In his view, the abrupt actions in this case “suggests that those advising our government have omitted the first lesson of public health, which is that context matters”.There are intermittent bright spots. The west coast states of Kerala and Maharashtra (together home to 150 million people) are managing the crisis well, with clear communication and empathetic leadership. Meanwhile, despite the lack of clarity due to the severe lack of testing, there appears to be an anomaly in the speed and severity of Covid-19 infection in India, prompting many theories, including the prevalence of BCG vaccination, the pre-existing ubiquity of coronaviruses, and thewarmer climate.But even if Covid-19 mercifully spares India the kind of havoc it has wrought in Italy, the unsustainability of the country’s post-liberalisation economy has been exposed. Its main engine – the vaunted “demographic idend” of millions of interchangeable young workers – has decamped from the cities to rural areas, virtually en masse. When travel restrictions are lifted, even more will leave. Economic history tells us wages shot up after the Black Death in medieval Europe, when employers became desperate. Something similar could happen here.Over the telephone from New Delhi, social activist Harsh Mander urged me to look closely at images of the exodus. They’re overwhelmingly young, wearing jeans and clutching smartphones. India’s 21st-century economic model was built on them, and now they have walked out on it. “It’s because they have been completely thrown under the bus,” he told me. “You have made them lose faith in the government. The entire imagination of this lockdown is to keep 300 or 400 million people in the middle class safe, on the back of intense suffering unleashed on everyone else.”Mander and I discussed the parallels with the 1943 Bengal famine, which cost about 3 million lives. As famously analysed by Amartya Sen, that agonising episode was precipitated by policy failures rather than food shortages, and exacerbated by Winston Churchill’s cynical decision to withhold supplies. “This is another manmade crisis,” Mander said. “We could have avoided this violence, the complete annihilation of poor people, if we had just worked together to approach the problem. But no conversation was possible.”I was still mulling this over at 9pm on Sunday, which is the time the prime minister urged the nation to switch off lights, and burn candles to demonstrate solidarity in the fight against the coronavirus. Within minutes, my Twitter feed spilled over with images and videos of the exercise gone awry. In one that showed up repeatedly, I watched as an enthusiastic young man inadvertently set his own hair on fire. The leaping flames were extinguished by the brutal pummelling of his friends. Those scars will never leave him. It struck me as an acutely appropriate metaphor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5baea2ec1645ff4d94c5cfbcafa4805984820c5/0_47_2999_1799/master/2999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b6ddb427adf203e3c92624cb6d096ac","title":"coronavirus doctors whistleblowers history silenced","story":"Dr Li Wenliang tried to sound the alarm about the coronavirus outbreak. For centuries, doctors have been doing the same – leading to backlash and even deathDr Li Wenliang was an astute observer. Back in December, the Chinese opthamologist noticed that there were a series of patients who had upper respiratory infections in Wuhan that seemed similar to prior Sars outbreaks. He alerted colleagues on WeChat but was quickly criminalized by the state for spreading “false rumours”. It wasn’t until after the young doctor’s death from Covid-19, the same disease he had identified, that the Chinese authorities cleared him of wrongdoing.Just a few weeks later, and a few thousand miles away, American doctors are experiencing a similar silencing. Physicians and nurses have lost their jobs during the surging pandemic for alerting media about shortages of masks and hospital equipment. At the highest level, the Trump administration has resisted the advice of Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and a physician, when he called for a more urgent and intense federal response.Central to the art of doctoring is observation. Physicians see disease and destitution in clinics and hospitals. They interview and listen, and trace illness back to family histories and living situations and environment. They advise politicians and government agencies with data and science. For many centuries, this has led doctors to speak out against the powers that be – demanding that they treat at the source. But in many countries, this has also led to backlash, even death.Rudolf Virchow was a German physician in the 19th century, known for linking cancer to the cell. He was also a writer, a scientist and a politician, applying his faculties in microscopy to the city infrastructure in Berlin to curb the spread of disease through sewage and water. Virchow is credited with creating Germany’s first public health programs.Virchow got in trouble regularly – he was expelled from Charite hospital for joining the 1848 revolution, and was ostracized by his colleagues. But the doctor truly found himself in the line of fire when he criticized the government’s investment in the military instead of education and alleviating poverty.As one story goes, the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck was so furious that he challenged Virchow to a duel. Bismarck found Virchow at work in his lab, where he had recently identified the roundworm Trichinella spiralis, which can contaminate meat. “I suppose I have the choice of weapons,” the doctor apparently said, and held up two large sausages. He told the Bismarck that one was filled with the roundworm he was studying, the other was completely safe to eat, and asked him to choose one. The duel ended there.Virchow’s fate, however, is in some ways a lucky one. Other physicians who have spoken out on behalf of their patients, or the poor, have suffered blackmail, violence and persecution.In more recent years, Binayak Sen, an Indian pediatrician, highlighted the struggles and inequities in healthcare faced by the most marginalized in Indian society: the country’s aasis, or indigenous people, some of whom identified with a Maoist movement. For three decades, Sen lived in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, where he trained health workers to provide where government healthcare failed. He systematically documented the senseless deaths from malnutrition, lack of access to adequate healthcare and lack of political agency.But the central government started noticing Sen’s activism when he became involved in the People’s Union for Civil Liberties, a human rights organization that investigated abuses against indigenous people. In 2007, the Indian government charged him with sedition, a law originally created by British colonial government to control the local population. He was sentenced to life in prison on charges of supporting a Maoist insurgency.Sen was jailed for several years and spent a considerable amount of that time in solitary confinement. He was released without comment from the supreme court of India in 2011. But 13 years later, his appeal is still pending in front of the Chhattisgarh high court.While some physicians are criminalized for speaking from the margins of society, others are involved in larger revolutionary movements. Such was the case for Steve Biko, a South African medical student who began a social movement to fight apartheid in the 1970s. At the time, healthcare systems for black and white iniduals in South Africa were separate and unequal. Black doctors were largely not allowed to take care of white patients, or even examine their bodies when they died.As Biko was highlighting systemic inequities through his black consciousness movement, he was subject to a “banning order” from the government, which censured his speech and movement. In 1977, he was detained by police under the pretext of a terrorism act, and beaten to the point of brain hemorrage. The prison physician ignored recommendations by a consulting neurologist and neurosurgeon, and Biko died at the hands of the state, alone in a jail cell.That year, a group of doctors filed a claim, demanding that the Medical Association of South Africa take action against the prison doctors, but it was left idle in the court.Eight years later, Dr Wendy Orr, a medical doctor for the government, started to take notice of these cases. Orr said later that she was the only physician “to reveal evidence of police torture and abuse of political detainees in South Africa”. After seeing countless patients showing signs of being tortured by police forces, she alerted her superiors, only to be informed that her job was solely to tend to the wounds and physical complaints that the prisoners had.In the mid 1980s, Orr took her claim to the South African Supreme Court. The court heard both Orr’s case, as well as the one brought on by the doctors hoping to seek justice in Steven Biko’s death. But the Medical Association of South Africa turned their head yet again, refusing to punish those responsible for these prison deaths.Orr became the commissioner for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, where these abuses were recounted in detail for the first time. She recalled later that the stories of witnesses such as Mr Nalgas, a subject of the torture, brought Archbishop Desmond Tutu to tears. “For me this sums up the damage done to all of us by apartheid: it treated black people as something less than human, and it dehumanized white people because they came to believe that,” she wrote.As the world grapples with the Covid-19 pandemic, the censorship and silencing of whistleblowing physicians persists. One the one hand, health workers are held on a pedestal - with citizens lining their windows and balconies to applaud them every evening in cities like London and New York. But when they push their institutions or governments too far - whether calling for public health measures like physical distancing, or funding for something as simple as a mask, doctors risk not only their lives on the frontlines, but also their jobs and basic rights.As Virchow, the German pathologist, astutely noted: “Medicine is a social science, and politics is nothing else but medicine on a large scale.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8506b029720fc360f691b5c6329591018916b3df/0_179_3997_2398/master/3997.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fb9a94165e9bf49218a8c59bdee6408","title":"record size hole opens in ozone layer above the arctic","story":"Rare hole is result of low temperatures in atmosphere and is expected to disappear A rare hole has opened up in the ozone layer above the Arctic, in what scientists say is the result of unusually low temperatures in the atmosphere above the north pole.The hole, which has been tracked from space and the ground over the past few days, has reached record dimensions, but is not expected to pose any danger to humans unless it moves further south. If it extends further south over populated areas, such as southern Greenland, people would be at increased risk of sunburn. However, on current trends the hole is expected to disappear altogether in a few weeks.Low temperatures in the northern polar regions led to an unusual stable polar vortex, and the presence of ozone-destroying chemicals such as chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere – from human activities – caused the hole to form.The hole is not related to the Covid-19 shutdowns that have drastically cut air pollution and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. It is also too early to say whether the unusually stable Arctic polar vortex conditions are linked with the climate crisis, or part of normal stratospheric weather variability.Peuch said there were no direct implications for the climate crisis. Temperatures in the region are already increasing, slowing the depletion of ozone, and the hole will start to recede as polar air mixes with ozone-rich air from lower latitudes. The last time similar conditions were observed was in spring 2011.The hole was tracked by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, based partly in Reading and funded by the European commission.While a hole over the Arctic is a rare event, the much larger hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic has been a major cause for concern for more than four decades. The production of ozone-depleting chemicals has been drastically reduced, under the 1987 Montreal Protocol, but some sources appear still to be functioning – in 2018, unauthorised emissions were detected from eastern China.The Antarctic ozone hole was the smallest in 35 years last November, showing the success of efforts to cut the production of the harmful pollutants. The ozone layer protects the earth from harmful levels of ultraviolet radiation from the sun.New sources of ozone-depleting chemicals were not a factor in the hole observed in the Arctic, said Peuch. “However, this is a reminder that one should not take the Montreal Protocol measures for granted, and that observations from the ground and from satellites are pivotal to avoid a situation where the chlorine and bromine levels in the stratosphere could increase again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f685685b7dfec5102e22751398394d2d9189c597/0_346_4608_2763/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed2cfe740bb7ef703e629f6ca6db6360","title":"wildlife destruction not a slippery slope but a series of cliff edges","story":"New study finds unless global warming stemmed, ocean ecosystems likely to collapse in 2020s and land species in 2040sWildlife species will die out and natural ecosystems collapse in the near future if the climate crisis goes unchecked, scientists have warned, as new research shows that the natural world is at far greater risk from climate breakdown than previously thought.Catastrophe could strike this decade for some species, as key temperature thresholds are crossed. Instead of the anticipated gradual decline of species, there are likely to be a series of sudden collapses.Ocean ecosystems will be first hit, as the seas have already warmed to an unprecedented extent, and problems such as lack of oxygen and an increase in acid worsen. By the 2040s, a similarly abrupt collapse is likely to spread to the land, causing devastation among key species in Indonesia, the Amazon, India, northern Australia and sub-Saharan Africa and the Congo rainforest.“It’s not a slippery slope, but a series of cliff edges, hitting different places at different times,” said Alex Pigot of University College London, lead author of the study, published today in the journal Nature.What appears to happen, according to the study’s authors, is that most species can cope with warming temperatures for a while. But when a certain temperature threshold is crossed, suddenly a large proportion of species face conditions they have not experienced before, and the ecosystem can abruptly collapse.The authors base their projections on iding the globe into square cells of 100km by 100km, and within those cells studying the geographic ranges of more than 30,000 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and other animals and plants. They mapped this data against our knowledge of the climate from 1850 to 2005.Then they broke down climate predictions from now until 2100 on an annual basis, examining when the species in each grid cell were likely to experience temperatures higher than they had before. That showed a different picture than had been previously possible, by giving a slow-motion projection, a bit like a time-lapse photograph, at a very fine scale, of how species would react each year as their habitats warmed.

Similar to the Covid-19 pandemic, early action to limit the risk pays off in a big way. It does not eliminate all risk from climate change, but reduces the number of species and ecosystems exposed by a massive amount.”Scientists have known for years about the likely existence of “tipping points” in the world’s climate, when global heating triggers abrupt or self-reinforcing changes: for instance, the melting of the Arctic ice cap uncovers dark sea beneath, which absorbs more heat than the reflective ice and, in turn, results in more melting.This new paper is one of a growing body of research showing there could be similar tipping points in the natural world, related to climate breakdown. It adds to other studies that have shown the Amazon and other major rainforests are likely to turn from carbon sinks to carbon sources, and shown the extent to which the sea and land have already absorbed the impacts of global heating.Mark Wright, director of science at WWF-UK, said: “There is already more than enough evidence that climate change is impacting the natural world and that we risk losing up to a million species. We know what the solutions are to halt climate change and bioersity loss. “The world is currently rightly focused on tackling the global health emergency. However, this new research reinforces that, after we are through this extremely difficult time, we will need renewed ambitious action to address the climate and nature crisis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/873afbbb58df344d84ef3c3497831ed25ab22624/492_0_1429_858/master/1429.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50482f5946d884d36f05c55dbada1a04","title":"dreamland review juliette lewis henry rollins","story":"Juliette Lewis plays an unhinged diplomat’s wife and party animal in this pulpy thriller about sex-trafficking gangstersTripland?

Johnny works for hyper-violent gangster Hercules (Henry Rollins, not nearly menacing enough), who has expanded his criminal enterprise to kidnap and pimp out girls to rich men.

And here’s where the film gets really silly. The Vampire is supposed to be skin-crawlingly repulsive, but actually he’s as scary as a baddie in a kids’ cartoon.

This deserves to go one of those ‘best of’ Christmas VHSes. He was running towards his own goal, having intercepted a loose ball, with Ince and Webb on his tail. Then, like a pickpocket scooting down an alleyway, he lost them both with a high-speed Cruyff turn.Ince instinctively stuck out a leg and brought Milligan down, but it’s a reflection of how well Milligan had duped him that, by the time Ince’s momentum stopped, he had run so far that he was out of shot. What a player Milligan is: dynamic, composed, tough, intelligent, very mature for a 23-year-old. If he can’t get in Ireland’s World Cup squad – and it doesn’t look like he will – they must be in bloody good shape.51 min United have started the second half as sluggishly as they did the first. Joe Worrall has a word with Steve Bruce – not about United’s sluggishness, it’s none of his business, but because of a very late tackle on Ritchie.50 min “Afternoon Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “On the Barrett goal: surely, in such a technologically advanced society, it can’t be beyond the wit of man to come up with a foolproof method of deciding whether a player is offside or not? Some sort of video assisted linesman, if you will, or VIDAL for short. I doubt it’ll ever happen, though. And anyway, what would we moan about if all decisions were correct thanks to the wonders of TV evidence?”‘Technologically advanced’! I guess one of us didn’t spend all of last night unsuccessfully trying to load R-Type on the Spectrum.49 min Ritchie loses Pallister with another classy turn on the halfway line. Along with Webb, has been the cmost imaginative player on the pitch.47 min Ritchie holds off Ince, surges away from Robson and stabs a pass towards Marshall on the edge of the D. He drags his shot well wide under pressure from Pallister.46 min United begin the second half. Oldham can’t play on grass, discuss.45+2 min Webb twists away from Barlow on the right and curls a wicked cross that bounces across the six-yard box before being put behind by Irwin.45 min Ritchie holds off Pallister on the left and plays a classy reverse pass towards Henry, who is tracked all the way by the increasingly impressive Ince. 43 min Gibson clips a pass forward to Hughes, who holds off Andy Holden just outside the area and hammers a left-footed shot that is held by Hallworth. That’s much better from Hughes, who has spent large parts of the first half in Earl Barrett’s pocket.42 min The resulting corner, taken by Webb on the left, flashes past Hallworth and right across the face of goal.41 min: NOW ROBSON ALMOST GIVES UNITED THE LEAD! We’ve had three near misses into the space of 90 seconds, culminating in this chance for United. McClair, found by Hughes, clipped a superb, dipping cross from the right. Webb lost Barrett smartly but then lost his balance. Behind him, Irwin got to the ball a split-second before Gibson and erted it partially away from goal. Robson charged imperiously onto the loose ball and looked certain to get his second, only for Irwin and Barrett – who had both been hurtling towards their own goal - to change direction and throw themselves at the ball to block the shot. Six or seven players ended up in a heap, including Robson, a demonstration of the total commitment on both sides. This is pulsating stuff!40 min: OFF THE LINE BY INCE! Oldham almost take the lead from the corner. Leighton, under pressure from Ritchie, could only flap it straight to Henry in the D. He cracked a shot that went through the crowd, including Leighton, and was kicked away by Ince on the near post. 40 min: CHANCE FOR OLDHAM! Redfearn plays a good pass down the right to Irwin, who charges into a big space behind the United defence. Eventually he gets his head up and lofts a precise cross to the far post, where Marshall’s header is crucially blocked by Pallister. The ball runs loose to Rick Holden, who is challenged by Pallister at the expense of a corner. The first intervention was the most important: with Leighton wrong-footed, Marshall’s header was going in. 38 min Oldham have responded really well to the disappointment of United’s equaliser. Milligan and Henry are still having the better of Robson and Ince in midfield. It’s a cracking battle, mind, and Ince has probably been United’s best player. 35 min Leighton takes a risk by blatantly shoving Ritchie in the back at an Oldham corner. Technically that should have been a penalty, even though it would have been soft. Leighton just wanted Ritchie out of his personal space, but you’re not really supposed to use both hands to push someone in the back. Joe Worrall definitely saw it, because he had a word with Leighton before the next corner was taken.34 min Rick Holden gets away from Phelan to win a corner. Nothing comes of it but that will encourage Oldham, as it’s the first time Holden has had any joy down the left. He’s usually such an influential player.31 min An Oldham free-kick is headed away to Redfearn on the edge of the area. He volleys it into orbit.31 min Bruce is penalised for a late tackle on Ritchie. There’s a heck of a din now, 95 per cent of it from the United fans.31 min: Brilliant defending from Barrett! United almost made it two in two minutes. Phelan drove a long angled pass up to Webb, who cushioned an excellent header into the path of McClair on the edge of the box. He was shaping to knock the ball into the area when Barrett flew through the air to stud the ball away. Plenty of the United fans appealed for a free-kickpenaltyANYTHING REFEREE FOR HEAVEN’S SAKE IT’S BEEN A LONG SEASON, but the players realised it was a fair tackle.30 min Alex Ferguson will be thrilled that the two players he gambled on, Webb and Robson, combined for the goal. It was a really good ball from Webb, a serene touch of class in this frenetic game.If you want a job done properly, do it yourself. Having watched his team-mates blunder around for half an hour, Bryan Robson has dragged them level! After a game of pinball in the Oldham half, Bruce slid in decisively near the halfway line to beat Marshall to a loose ball. It ran through to Webb, who took a touch and angled a soft, early pass into the space behind the defence. Robson, who was on his arse a split-second earlier after a late tackle from Milligan, marauded through and forced a right-footed shot through Hallworth.It wasn’t a perfect finish – Hallworth got a good piece of it – but it trickled over the line. This is the fourth FA Cup semi-final in a row in which Robson has scored – and it says a lot about his personality that three of those were equalisers. How many times is he going to pull United out of the malodorous stuff? He’s nowhere near fully fit, but here he is, bending yet another big match to his will. The word ‘hero’ doesn’t begin to do him justice.29 min The Oldham captain Milligan, who is having a marvellous game in midfield, cushions a fine volleyed pass to Rick Holden on the left. His dangerous cross is excellently claimed under pressure by Leighton.27 min Barrett dispossesses Hughes with another classy piece of defending. Ince then ploughs through Marshall, and snarls at the referee Joe Worrall for having the temerity to give a free-kick. He’s a fine player, Ince, but he’s got quite a mouth on him.26 min “This match might be being played on grass, but Boundary Park is clearly the future,” says Matt Dony. “I’m pretty certain that, in ten years, all top-level football will be played on artificial turf. I’d stake my reputation on it.”24 min Ritchie spots Leighton slightly off his line and tries an imaginative flat chip that drifts a few yards wide.23 min “That Irwin lad looks pretty decent for Oldham,” says Charlie in Sheffield. “I can see him ending up at a big club like Man City next season.”And get in the team ahead of Paul Lake? I don’t think so.22 min Phelan’s long throw is collected by Hughes at the near post. He plays a bit of keepy-uppy, shielding the ball from Barrett, before volleying a cross on the turn that is stabbed away by Irwin in the six-yard box. That was a vital clearance because Robson had arrived late in the box with considerable intent.22 min For the 42342393245425th time in his career, Barry Davies nails it: If there’s a word that would sum up Manchester United’s performance so far, it is ‘uncomfortable’: all over the pitch, they are not enjoying what they are being asked to do.There’s another word that would sum up United’s performance, mind you, but only after 9pm.22 min Hughes rumbles into the area and is muscled off the ball by the impressive Barrett. He runs the ball to safety and is then hoofed up in the air by Robson, who gets a talking-to from Joe Worrall. Barrett has been the best player on the pitch thus far. Never mind his goal he has done an immaculate marking job on Hughes. 21 min After a bit of a scramble near the halfway line, Irwin lobs a clever pass over the top of the United defence. It looks like Ritchie is through for a moment, but Ince shows admirable pace to get back and clear the danger.20 min “Despite that early goal I don’t fancy Oldham,” says Vic Rushton. “They were absolutely dreadful last Saturday in losing at Ayresome Park, despite Boro also having a Wembley hangover. Can also see there being a few goals as Hallworth and Leighton have been performing erratically all season.”They’ve been the livelier team so far, though you do worry about how much they’ll have in the tank if it’s still tight in the second half.19 min Webb, running away from goal on the right, digs out a splendid cross that is headed away by the under-pressure Irwin. Webb, on whom United are so dependent for creativity, is starting to look a bit livelier. He’s playing very high up the pitch, almost as a second centre-forward.17 min There have been lots of offsides at both ends. That often leads to a ponderous, stop-start game, but not today. As soon as play resumes, both teams start charging round at 100mph again. It’s not entirely sophisticated but it has made for rollocking entertainment.15 min Ince tries to surge away from Milligan, who matches him for speed and then dispossesses him with a beautifully judged sliding tackle. He plays the ball up to Ritchie, who loses Pallister with a lovely dummy. The move came to nothing in the end but it showed both the graft and the class of this wonderful Oldham side. It’s a minor scandal that Andy Ritchie is not playing in Division One. It might be too late for him, at the age of 29, unless Oldham get promoted. But one way or another, it’s a matter of time before Milligan is playing in the top flight.14 min Webb’s inswinging corner from the left is superbly claimed under pressure by Hallworth, arching his back like a limbo dancer in mid-air.12 min Webb suddenly finds a bit of space on the right of the area and wins United’s first corner. It’s half cleared by Oldham and then headed down to Ince in the D. He waits for it to bounce and leathers a left-footed shot that is well blocked by Barlow.11 min United have been really scruffy in possession. Hughes keeps getting caught offside, and their playmaker Webb has barely touched the ball. He’s nowhere near the pace of the game.10 min The first signs of life from United. A long goalkick from Leighton is headed on by Hughes towards Gibson, and Andy Holden comes across to make a tremendous last-ditch challenge on the edge of the area. 8 min United are behind for the first time in this season’s FA Cup. They don’t have the happiest memories of this ground, either, having been plugged 5-1 in the derby last September.7 min Bruce is penalised for a foul on Ritchie. There have been some crunching tackles all over the pitch.7 min The replays of the goal aren’t conclusive on the Barrett offside, though my hunch is that he was onside when the cross came him. One thing that replays do confirm is that Leighton should have done better. He was under pressure from Ritchie, it’s true, but it was still a pretty straightforward take for a keeper of his class.David has landed another one on Goliath: Oldham have taken the lead! It came from that corner on the right, which was headed back to the taker Holden. His awkward cross bounced through Leighton at the near post, and Barrett – in splendid isolation, with a whiff of offside – tapped it into the open net from four yards! His centre-back partner Andy Holden gives him a peck on the cheek in celebration. What a start for Oldham!5 min A big scare for United! Ritchie’s cross from the right led to a mix-up between Leighton and Phelan, who was spooked by the hot breath of Rick Holden behind him. In the end Phelan knocked the ball past the outrushing Leighton and just wide of his own goal.4 min In the build-up to this game, Alex Ferguson said that Oldham are one of the quickest teams in England, and that they would try to win the game in the first half hour. His prediction looks right it has been a seriously frantic start to this game.3 min Bryan Robson, who doesn’t really understand the concept of feeling your way back after injury, introduces himself to Andy Ritchie with a ferocious man-and-ball tackle. “The ball must have squealed!” says the BBC commentator Barry Davies with a squeal of his own.2 min United are playing with Mike Phelan at right-back, Brian McClair on the right of midfield and Neil Webb much further forward, just behind Mark Hughes. Oldham are in their expected 4-4-2 shape.1 min Peep peep! Oldham kick off from right to left as we watch. They are in their blue Bovis kit. United, sponsored by you-know-who, are in red.Here we go, then. Oldham v Manchester United, for the right to place Crystal Palace at Wembley next month.There’s another reason why so many people fancy United today: the match is being played on grass. All Oldham’s giant-killings have taken place on the plastic pitch at Boundary Park, which is also where they’ve picked up 42 of their 57 league points. But they also played well in drawing away to Everton and Southampton before finishing them off in a replay, and Graham Taylor and George Graham – whose Villa and Arsenal sides were hammered at Boundary Park – both said it had diddly squat to do with the pitch.Alex Ferguson has gambled big-time by picking both Neil Webb and Bryan Robson. Webb has started only one league game since August. Robson hasn’t played any first-team football since Christmas.Oldham make one change from their defeat at Leicester in the week, with Jon Hallworth replacing Andy Rhodes in net.Hello and welcome to live coverage of After the Lord Mayor’s Show. The greatest match in FA Cup history ended a few minutes ago, with Crystal Palace beating Liverpool 4-3 in an absolute astonisher at Villa Park. Spare a thought for the players of Oldham and Manchester United, who have the impossible task of trying to replicate the drama when they kick off at Maine Road.As if they’ll give a flying Fibonacci about that! A place in the FA Cup final is at stake, for goodness sake, and both teams would happily take the ugliest 1-0 win in history. Especially United. The FA Cup has become an obsession for them and their hapless manager Alex Ferguson, who was on the brink of the sack at the start of their cup run. If they lose today, he’ll be back on the brink.United haven’t been to Wembley since Ferguson took over in 1986. Oldham’s last trip was minus 21 days ago: they will play Nottingham Forest in the Littlewoods Cup final at the end of the month. They’ve been stealing the headlines ever since Frankie Bunn walloped six goals against Scarborough in the Littlewoods Cup in October, and if they win today they will become the first lower-ision side to reach both English cup finals in the same season.When Oldham thrashed Aston Villa, the Division One leaders, in the quarter-final last month, the smart money was on them beating United. But things have changed since then. Oldham have lost their last three games without scoring a goal and are down to to ninth in Division Two, though they do have two games in hand on all the sides above them. It looks like their season of derring-do – this is their 54th game, with at least another 10 to come – might be catching up with them.United, meanwhile, are in a bit of a purple patch: they have won two league games in a row for only the second time in 14 months, and are now five points above the relegation zone. Neil Webb and Bryan Robson are both back after long-term injuries. The odds have tipped in United’s favour. Our football correspondent David Lacey’s scorecast is 3-1 United after extra-time, which sounds about right. Mind you, we all tipped Liverpool to hammer Palace, didn’t we?Kick off is at 3.30pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/315129fcd770a8f10d2ceec88aba898e98906362/20_151_3269_1962/master/3269.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3d1834bd6a57e988a91bcbc41549d51","title":"eight bristol city players money save club ashton gate eight coronavirus","story":"Players may lose money during the coronavirus pandemic but few will sacrifice as much as the Ashton Gate EightBy Steven Pye for That 1980s Sports BlogMany footballers will have to take pay cuts to help their clubs survive during the coronavirus pandemic but, when it comes to making career and financial sacrifices, surely nothing can match the story of the Ashton Gate Eight. Bristol City were struggling to balance the books in the early 1980s and faced the very real threat of extinction. Having been promoted the top tier in 1976 under the management of Alan Dicks, the club’s problems began when players’ contracts changed in 1978.Previously, players were bound to clubs even after their contracts expired. But new legislation stipulated that players could now leave once their contracts had expired. The selling club would still get a fee, but the ruling changed the footballing landscape.Gary Collier, an important player at Bristol City, took advantage of the change. “He took his chance to test the new system and walked out,” explained Dicks. “The players who stayed heard he was being offered £500 a week by Coventry, which was certainly more than they were getting, so I went to the board and said we should reward loyalty. We were in the First Division and it was essential to keep our best players.”Dicks and the board were determined to secure players on long-term deals on relatively decent wages so that there would be no repeat of the Collier move. Clive Whitehead agreed an 11-year contract, with Gerry Gow and Tom Ritchie both signing up for seven years. With average attendances of 19,000 and First Division football, the future looked bright.“Whitehead, Gow and Ritchie were all put on around £450 a week,” said Dicks. “I didn’t think that was exorbitant for a First Division club.” Maybe not, but the gaping hole in the plan became evident when Bristol City were relegated in 1980. The combination of declining attendances and players on lucrative deals was not a good one for their finances. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200406-62191-gnl.fw.200406.jf.1998WorldCupfinalv2.mp3 On and off the pitch, the club was lurching from one disaster to the next. Dicks was sacked in September 1980 and replaced by Bob Houghton, the English manager who had led Malmö to the European Cup final the year before. Roy Hodgson followed Houghton back from Sweden to work as his assistant, but the pair were unable to prevent a second straight relegation.The club was spiralling out of control. Houghton left in January 1982 with the club in the relegation zone yet, more importantly, their very existence was in danger. Bristol City were £850,000 in debt, owed the Inland Revenue £100,000, were reportedly losing £4,000 a week and still had to pay transfer money to Newcastle for Mick Harford and Malmö for Jan Möller.There was seemingly only one way out of the hole: the club would be declared bankrupt, a new club would be formed under a new board and the players who were on long-term deals would be asked to tear up their contracts. Without these measures, the club would die.Enter the Ashton Gate Eight. Geoff Merrick, Chris Garland, Trevor Tainton, David Rodgers, Gerry Sweeney, Jimmy Mann, Peter Aitken and Julian Marshall were given an ultimatum to end all ultimatums. Either they agreed to have their contracts terminated or the club would fold. No pressure then.The discussions between the club and players were time-consuming and stressful. With new PFA secretary Gordon Taylor fighting the corner of the players, pressure grew on the eight. They were on deals worth between £20,000 and £25,000 a year, which hardly made them the wealthy footballers of the modern era.Merrick, who had been at the club for more than 15 years and was the club’s PFA representative, explained the predicament. “We have families and mortgages and are obviously reluctant to give up the protection of our contracts, although we appreciate the seriousness of City’s plight.” Taylor was firm on his position: “It is unfair that the eight should be sacrificed because of the mismanagement of the club over a number of years.”Initially, the eight players turned down a combined deal worth £58,000 from the club. “How can players be expected to go on the dole so that a club which has been badly handled can be given a second chance?” protested Merrick. But deep down the loyalty of the players involved was always going to pull at their heartstrings.Merrick, Garland, Tainton, Sweeney and Mann had played more than 200 games each for the club Merrick, Tainton and Rodgers had been at Bristol City for their entire careers. As much as they wanted to protect themselves, the prospect of seeing the club they loved go under was too much to contemplate.Another offer of £80,000 was rejected, as the scrutiny on the eight ramped up. “This is positively the last chance,” said Ken Sage, a new member of the board. “I think everyone believes we are kidding, but we are not. We have dug into our own pockets to spread a little extra money around and this is the final offer. If the players don’t take it by noon on Wednesday, the club folds.”Finally, on 3 February 1982, the Ashton Gate Eight agreed a deal that meant Bristol City would survive. The players put the concerns of the club above their own interests and accepted £10,000 each plus gate receipts from a special testimonial match between Ipswich and Southampton at Ashton Gate that would be held a month later.“It’s wonderful to see the club survive and tremendously emotional for us at the same time,” said Merrick. “There’s also got to be some bitterness at the way the eight players have almost been held responsible when everyone else seems to blame bad management.”Taylor was quick to praise them. “My eight members have become sacrificial offerings to keep Bristol City alive. They have handled themselves with so much dignity. Hopefully what has happened here will not happen again.”Caretaker manager Hodgson battled manfully to keep the club in the Third Division, but to no avail. They went down again, their third relegation in as many seasons. Yet the fact that the club survived was a victory. The match after the good news broke attracted the biggest crowd of the season, with Garland and Aitken among the 9,228 spectators at Ashton Gate for the visit of Fulham.The players were lauded for their actions, but they had mixed feelings. “We’ve been let down,” said Merrick at the time. “Now I have no job and nothing coming in. I’ll have to go on the dole.” Merrick never played league football again. The business Tainton had been running alongside his football career was pushed into bankruptcy.A plaque outside Ashton Gate commemorates the role the eight played in saving Bristol City. The sacrifices they made will never be forgotten by supporters of the club, and rightly so. Footballers often received bad press. The Ashton Gate Eight did their best to redress the balance and they saved a football club in the process.• This article appeared first on That 1980s Sports Blog• Follow Steven Pye on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba70a3c84477e681cf0adb59daf99c0eb1d6979d/89_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60ffa4ce6f6de83c771247f2fc826a2b","title":"final fantasy vii remake review a classic game reaches new heights","story":"PS4 Square EnixHailed as one of the greatest games ever, its remake is superbly reimagined without losing the distinctive quality of the originalModern remakes of classic films inevitably disappoint – but the opposite has tended to be true of video games. The technology behind them improves each year, so at the very least, old games can benefit from having spectacular new visuals applied to them. This remake of 1997’s Final Fantasy VII – often hailed as one of the greatest games ever made – goes way beyond a mere graphical makeover. Nearly a decade in the making, it expands and completely reimagines the original game, but crucially without losing its essence.The opening mission, featuring ex-soldier Cloud Strife teaming up with eco-activist organisation Avalanche, is pretty much the only part of Final Fantasy VII Remake that is a scene-by-scene update of the original. Even that sequence showcases a much-improved battle system, which is uncharacteristically action-based for a Japanese RPG, but remains underpinned by the original’s turn-based system and supports the tactical depth for which the genre is known. You still have to wait for a recharge before using special abilities and items or casting spells, but you can always employ standard attacks, and dodge or block incoming strikes.As the game progresses, the combat acquires extra layers, including so-called Limit Break attacks perfect for finishing off the more dangerous foes, and the ability to summon demons. The original game’s Materia system, which lets you attach different elemental traits to slots in your equipment, is more or less unchanged and brings a wealth of magic attacks and new special abilities.Final Fantasy VII’s storyline was what elevated it to classic status and in the remake, Square Enix has greatly expanded this aspect. Narrative moments that were originally short sequences involving moving from one place to another have now taken on a more quest-like feel, which helps the game’s general coherence and improves the ebb and flow of the plot.The original game’s eco-warrior theme felt progressive in 1997 and is more relatable now. The evil Shinra corporation is bleeding the planet dry of its lifeblood, called “mako”, and the rather naive Avalanche embarks on a campaign that involves blowing up its mako reactors, only to encounter a welter of plot twists before another villain emerges.Some super-fans have griped that expanding the story has caused the remake to become bloated, but the original story was often delivered in a rushed, breathless manner, and it now has time to unfold in a more detailed way, and the overarching story arc has been preserved.Another major addition to the remake are the periods of open-world gameplay, in which Cloud and his sidekicks take on side missions in the slums of the mega-city of Midgar, after performing their main-story raids. As with any collection of side missions, they vary wildly in theme and quality, from the ridiculous to the worthwhile, but the opportunities they provide to embark on intimate explorations of previously unseen parts of the game world prove welcome.As the game unfolds, Cloud assembles a shifting band of allies, many of whom join him in battle. They have complementary skills to the sword-wielding protagonist: Barret, for example, is a tank-like character armed with a machine-gun Tifa a hand-to-hand combat specialist and Aerith a staff-wielding mage. In combat, you can only control one character at a time, but you can switch between them, and even instruct characters you aren’t directly controlling to launch special attacks or use items on party members. Learning such techniques is vital to prevailing in the satisfyingly epic boss-battles.As with other Final Fantasy games, a certain amount of cheesiness occasionally creeps in to the narrative. Some of the peripheral characters prove annoyingly one-dimensional, and too many of the villains are characterised by cartoonish evil laughs.That said, Final Fantasy VII Remake elevates the original to new heights. It looks spectacularly good, but, more importantly, its gameplay has acquired a modern sheen without losing what made the game distinct in the first place. The insertion of new action sequences and the expansion of existing ones adds welcome variation, and it’s very meaty, too, with over 30 hours of gameplay on offer.What you get here is only the first half of the original game – a second, concluding instalment will arrive at a time as yet unspecified by Square Enix. Remaking a universally acclaimed classic was always a fearful responsibility, but like its own sword-wielding heroes, Square Enix has risen to the challenge spectacularly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2341b49034daa22d441da5a5a359fd381e614207/0_418_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=573bb23e1a16bc83cc248d0210998d2a","title":"global health policy can we manage the ever increasing rise of diabetes","story":"More than 400 million people have diabetes. While the condition can be treated effectively in the west, in low-income countries there is a need to improve access to insulin, medical devices, and health programmes to ensure early diagnosis and careTogether with cardiovascular diseases, cancers and chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes has become one of the world’s four major non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and one of the only chronic diseases that continues to increase in prevalence.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of people with diabetes increased from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014, and in 2016 it caused 1.6 million deaths, making it the seventh leading cause of death. The WHO estimates deaths from diabetes will increase to 2.4 million in 2030 and 3.7 million in 2045.The pharmaceutical industry is ramping up efforts to tackle diabetes through Global Health Progress, with more than 40 partnerships now researching new medicines, as well as new ways in which to diagnose and raise awareness of the disease.But what’s important, says Vanessa Peberdy, head of NCD advocacy and policy at the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), is that “the dialogue around diabetes treatment and care is not just confined to discussions on affordability and access to insulin. While this is clearly a critical issue, improving treatment and care requires a holistic approach that recognises the complexity of the condition. It needs to take in issues such as a lack of trained health practitioners, inadequate supply chains and weak health systems in developing countries.”“Access is a complex issue,” says Helen McGuire, programme leader, noncommunicable diseases at global health organisation Path. “Failures of access in low-resource settings are rarely due to a single cause.“Barriers must be addressed by leveraging multi-sectoral partnerships, which bring the unique expertise and resources of governments, non-profits, and industry to the table. Solutions require a long-term approach addressing issues of quality, affordability, availability, acceptability, and sustainability.”Emma Klatman is a health systems specialist at the international diabetes charity Life for a Child, which is tackling type 1 diabetes in low and middle income countries, where mortality rates among young people are especially high.Living without treatment can have horrific consequences, she says, and young people are faced with “blindness, losing limbs, developing kidney problems, and they just remain chronically unwell. They can struggle to complete their education, and find employment and marriage partners, and really do face a lot of social stigma.”The charity supplies local health centres with insulin, as well as blood glucose meters and testing strips, which Klatman says are an equally important part of effectively treating diabetes.It’s a point echoed by McGuire. “Self-care is essential to meet the daily demands of managing diabetes – therefore it is critical to take a people-centered approach to designing solutions,” she says. “Co-packaging of insulin, syringes, and glucose monitoring devices and strips together at an affordable price would go a long way to support people living with diabetes to safely administer insulin and monitor their glucose levels in low- and middle-income countries.”Next year is the centenary of insulin’s discovery, and ever since its first use the pharmaceutical industry has been developing new ways in which it can be delivered to patients.The first insulin pen was introduced in 1985 and immediately improved the accuracy of treatment. Now researchers are exploring an oral treatment for type 2 diabetes that will mean patients no longer need to inject at all. A smart insulin patch is also being developed that delivers tailored amounts of insulin into the bloodstream, and a new generation of insulin pumps can now be connected wirelessly to a blood glucose meter or under-the-skin sensor to monitor and regulate insulin.Research into the development of an artificial pancreas at the University of Cambridge is on-going, as is R\u0026ampD into cell therapy, when living cells are injected into patients to take over the function of the faulty ones.Sanofi, which along with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly make up the big three insulin manufacturers, has recently changed its approach to diabetes, shifting emphasis from new treatments to helping people to use existing medicines more effectively.Working with Biocorp, for instance, Sanofi is developing a new connected pen that automatically records dosage information through a mobile app. Its MyStar DoseCoach blood glucose meter uses a dose adjustment (titration) scheme to recommend daily doses of long-acting insulin, based on daily blood sugar measurements linked to any incidents of low blood sugar through the day.“Affordability of insulin is just one of the necessary components, along with creating awareness in the communities, building capacity for care and medicine supply, educating patients, improving demand forecasting and reducing transportation costs for the patients.”Klatman sees the growth of partnerships like this as crucial to providing the level of diabetes care that is needed in developing countries, and looks forward to the day when families “are able to access insulin and other supplies without being exposed to financial risk, and having to make really tough decisions to keep their kids alive”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/882464b7dd634a93b8c48780f0b6eab4eac217b2/0_94_3007_1805/master/3007.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fc7af94e8f59709c0af1e72246f0555","title":"how are you celebrating easter in lockdown coronavirus","story":"We’d like to hear how you are marking the holiday in the midst of the coronavirus pandemicFor many people across the UK, Easter will look very different this year.

But with a little effort, you can see that voice for what it is – and the benefits are endlessSolitude can be painful. The silence, the loneliness, the absence of mental stimulation from social interaction – and for many, enduring time alone with your thoughts.If you’re struggling with this during the lockdown period, ironically you’re not alone. One study from psychologists at Virginia and Harvard universities found that many would rather give themselves an electric shock than be alone with their thoughts for 15 minutes. One reason why people find it so hard is their inner critic – that annoying voice in your head that chastises you and plays on your insecurities.Everyone has one, but its dominance varies from person to person. I came to the realisation that my inner critic was louder than I wanted it to be while living alone for the first time (it’s probably why I had avoided living alone for so long in the first place).Faced with its repeated assaults on my self-esteem, I decided it was time to take this villain on using a technique from my training to become a psychiatrist – cognitive behavioural therapy. Simple and effective, CBT teaches you to rationalise the negative thoughts that can make you feel down or anxious.These troublesome negative thoughts are often derived from an unhelpful “core belief”, usually formed by your early experiences. Maybe you tried for the school football team but didn’t make the cut? Inner critic: “You’re a failure.” Maybe you were bullied at school or your parents were quick to criticise? Inner critic: “Nobody likes you.”Your dastardly inner critic fires negative thoughts at you to persuade you that your core beliefs are facts. But thoughts are not facts, they are just ideas and like all ideas they need to be tested.So whenever I was attacked with one of my own unhelpful core beliefs or any of its derivative negative thoughts, I started weighing up the evidence for and against them. With time and effort, I started to realise that my inner critic was spouting nonsense.I’m a lot more comfortable with time alone now that I’ve discredited this voice. It still tries to feed me misinformation, of course, much like a conspiracy theorist on social media saying the coronavirus is a hoax or a consequence of 5G. I don’t entertain those views because they are not based on evidence, so why should I believe my inner critic?So, what are your unhelpful core beliefs? If you want to silence your inner critic, start writing down the evidence for and against the negative things it says to you – then, you can see objective proof of their invalidity. When the inner critic uses a mishap to try and convince you of your shortcomings, look for other possible explanations.It can be hard to see the positives when you’re stuck in a negative mindset, but with practice you can always find evidence against your inner critic’s views because they are so blinkered. Sure you have failed at some things, everyone has, but you have definitely succeeded at plenty of others.Eventually you will have disproved your inner critic so much you will see it as a drunk relative at a family gathering, rambling on but not worth listening to. You will also realise that as any situation can be seen from different perspectives, why not choose the most helpful one?There is, of course, room for positive change in all of us, but it should come from ourselves and not our inner critic, which is more interested in self-flagellation than self-improvement. If you can get a handle on this while in lockdown and learn how to rationalise your negative thoughts, it could make the whole experience easier. Your inner critic is holding you back in life by filling you with self-doubt, so overcoming it might just be the most useful thing you have ever done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3976416f0e4eedb009cd83872309da33c0ee2885/811_9_1634_981/master/1634.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11ae14b5b4e154b7d9f761a21c7d78dc","title":"jewish chronicle and jewish news to be liquidated and staff laid off","story":"Sources say staff have been told parent company has run out of money during UK lockdownThe Jewish Chronicle and Jewish News are to close and their staff made redundant, according to sources at the outlets, after their parent company ran out of money as the coronavirus pandemic devastates the media industry.While some news outlets have furloughed journalists in the hope of riding out the crisis, sources at the Jewish Chronicle say staff were informed the parent company had run out of cash and could not continue trading.The timing is particularly grim for staff as it is the start of the festival of Passover.A collapse in print sales and advertising revenue is hitting news outlets hard, with many local and independent newspapers facing severe financial strains.Last summer, the Jewish Chronicle – first published in 1841 – received new funding from its owner, the charitable Kessler Foundation. The money was provided by 20 iniduals, families and charitable trusts.In February, the Jewish Chronicle agreed to merge with its rival title Jewish News in an effort to secure the financial future of Jewish media in the UK. The deal had yet to be finalised, but sources said both outlets were effectively being treated in the same manner with staff laid off.Management told staff they were in negotiation with the Kessler Foundation to possibly secure the future of Jewish Chronicle in some form, potentially involving rehiring a number of people, although this would require new funding.Following the publication of this story, the Jewish Chronicle confirmed the news, which is likely to leave creditors out of pocket: “Despite the heroic efforts of the editorial and production team at the newspaper, it has become clear that the Jewish Chronicle will not be able to survive the impact of the current coronavirus epidemic in its current form.”They said every effort is being made to continue publication while efforts are made to save the outlets.On Tuesday, media analysts at Enders Analysis predicted a long-term blow to the British news industry as a result of the pandemic, with as many as a third of journalists losing their jobs.News outlets that rely heavily on print revenue have been hit particularly badly, with people not going to shops to buy copies and advertisers cutting back, leading to warnings that many outlets will close.• This article was amended on 8 April 2020 to change the headline."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8993a6a31c40cc539e977959aacf8454b65edae7/0_414_5280_3166/master/5280..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbbb80f284039d8f252e75b35ba87a46","title":"reschedule flights get refund airlines easyjet coronavirus","story":"Booking agents and airlines such as easyJet have been overwhelmed in the coronavirus crisis Mytrip is refusing to reschedule the £2,100 flights I booked. They’ve variously told me their systems are down, that they’ll transfer me to another department that then doesn’t answer, and that I should contact the airline.JS, Douglas, Isle of ManOther readers have shared similar frustrations. Mytrip, part of Etraveli Group, is facing the same challenges as every other booking agent – an inundation of customers whose trips have been cancelled and a shortage of personnel to deal with them. Its website states that priority is being given to those who were due to fly within six days and that it may take up to eight weeks for those with later departures to receive a refund or new travel date.“We contact the airlines and then get back to our customers as soon as we receive their reply,” it says. “Staff are working seven-day weeks to help, we are training staff from other departments and trying to get former colleagues to jump in.”Many passengers whose cancelled flights were booked direct through an airline are facing similar obstacles. EasyJet has removed its refund option from its website, obliging those who don’t want to reschedule to join the queue for the helpline.JD of West Hoathly, West Sussex has no use for a rebooking since his cancelled flight was to his late brother’s deathbed. “You cannot email easyJet and it has suspended its ‘chat’ facility,” he writes. “Each time you call customer service you get a message telling you to call back later. I understand they are swamped, so why not let people claim online?’’IM of Rimons, France reckons the reason is “a cynical ploy to force people to book another flight and not refund”. EasyJet argues many airlines are not issuing refunds at all, but ducked the question as to why the online option has been removed. “We are experiencing higher than average wait times and assure customers that these entitlements will be available long after their cancelled flight has flown,” it says.Ryanair does offer a refund option online but its system collapsed under the strain with readers reporting reservation numbers were not recognised. Ryanair blamed a “temporary glitch”.SM of Hitchin, Hertfordshire, accepted vouchers from Iberia in lieu of a refund, but when she tried to rebook her family of four on a new date, the system only accepted one voucher per booking. “Iberia suggested I book each passenger separately, but as our children are under 11 the system won’t allow that,” she writes. “The vouchers are only valid for one year, and it’s unlikely that we travel enough this year to get to use all four.” Iberia says it was aware of the issue and was working to amalgamate multiple vouchers into one for family bookings.Jet2 seems to be a rare example of an airline getting it right. “I called customer services as soon as our flight was cancelled and the refund was on my card that afternoon,” writes ME of Harrogate, North Yorkshire. “If Jet2 can do it, why not the other companies?”Most rental firms are also waiving cancellation or amendment fees, although Thrifty is more restrictive and Goldcar is still refusing modifications or cancellations for non-refundable budget bookings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d791d4b525d705e9bab3a5980dba5d156d1e20a7/612_334_2814_1688/master/2814..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef664e69aa672cedf0806397e967c9dd","title":"joan baez where to start in her back catalogue","story":"In the Listener’s digest series, our writers help you explore the work of great musicians. Today: the first lady of folk-rockDiamonds and Rust (1975)Invigorated by her new creative freedom after splitting with Vanguard Records in the early 1970s, Joan Baez wrote more of her own music than ever. The period led to inspired bouts of experimentation (she soundtracked a sci-fi film) as well as patience-testing indulgences (a 21-minute antiwar song on her 1973 album Where Are You Now, My Son?). Diamonds and Rust was the crowning achievement of her imperial period and one of the best singer-songwriter albums of the 70s.The crystalline voice that had made Baez the first lady of folk-rock had weathered into a warmer tone, and a kaleidoscope of genres including rock, jazz and soul added new colours to her maturing Washington Square sound. A stately take on Stevie Wonder’s ballad I Never Dreamed You’d Leave in Summer evokes the closing credits of a prestige weepie, while on the freewheeling Joni Mitchell duet Dida, the two singers’ voices swoop like swallows at dusk.Baez had butted heads with the 60s women’s movement, particularly for appearing on a cheeky anti-Vietnam conscription poster that stated: “GIRLS SAY YES to boys who say NO.” But Diamonds and Rust platforms women’s stories in its own way. Children and All That Jazz is a collaboration with the jazz virtuoso Hampton Hawes where Baez’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics describe the mindset of a frazzled mother – a perspective rarely made space for in “serious” art – her vocals doing soprano trapeze-work among the flurries of instrumentation.She is also unafraid to skewer the mythos of the scene that made her. The album’s title track is Baez’s greatest song, a clear-eyed postmortem of her romantic relationship with Bob Dylan that details rapturous highs and a novel’s worth of small cruelties. “As I remember your eyes were bluer than robin’s eggs  My poetry was lousy, you said,” she sings, her voice curdling. There’s more than a hint of that bruised sentiment in the “man child” poet Lana Del Rey described on Norman Fucking Rockwell, an artistic synergy confirmed by Del Rey and Baez’s exquisite live performance of Diamonds and Rust last year.There’s a strange, theremin-like purity to Baez’s singing voice in the traditional songs of her 1960 self-titled album that has led many critics to name it the best of her output that decade. Yet her outlaw taste and versatile abilities are more visible on Joan Baez5, which includes singular takes on songs written by Johnny Cash and Bob Dylan, as well as a cut-glass cover of protest singer Phil Ochs’ There But for Fortune (it was Baez’s first UK Top 10 hit). Her embrace of global genres from Brazilian baroque to 18th-century English folk deeply intuitive here, while her version of Dylan’s It Ain’t Me Babe is sung as both a lament and a warning, perhaps as a sign of the couple’s souring relationship. Baez was beginning to show her teeth.Come From the Shadows (1972)While Baez was a force in the 60s anti-war movement and a civil rights advocate, politics hit her closer to home in 1969 when her husband, the anti-war journalist David Harris, was jailed for draft evasion. The resulting album, Come From the Shadows, had Americana flourishes, a folk soul, and was unambiguously in conversation with 70s rock. In the Quiet Morning is an ecstatic elegy for Janis Joplin, the stately piano of Rainbow Road recalls classic Elton John, while To Bobby calls out Bob Dylan for his lapsed activism (he was unamused). Most stunningly, Baez is reinvented as a country empath in Prison Trilogy (Billy Rose), recruiting a cast of Nashville musicians in a call-out of police brutality and the inhuman treatment of undocumented immigrants, climaxing in a grave call to action: “Help us raze the prisons to the ground.”Whistle Down the Wind (2018)With a deeper vocal range and steely point of view, Baez’s 25th and (supposedly) final album is a late-period victory lap with eyes firmly on the here-and-now. These 10 covers  genres and epochs, peaking with the moving title track, a Tom Waits cover on which Baez sings of a life misspent in husky, mournful tones. She also updates an Anohni ballad for today’s climate emergency, while a cover of Zoe Mulford’s The President Sang Amazing Grace, a song about the in 2015, is a masterclass of teeth-gritted grace. Baez’s fundamental optimism is intact even as she surveys the wreckage of the world. “It’s the bitter end we’ve come down to,” she sings over uplifting piano. “The eye of the needle that we gotta get through.”The Altar Boy and the Thief (from Blowin’ Away, 1977)In the late 70s, Baez was an outspoken opponent of the Briggs initiative, a cruel proposal to ban gay and lesbian people from working in California schools. Her LGBTQ+ allyship was vividly brought to life in The Altar Boy and the Thief, a spare piano ballad from 1977’s Blowin’ Away. Inspired by the Pink Elephant, her local Santa Monica gay nightspot, Baez immortalises the bar’s open cruising and queens with “finely plucked eyebrows and skin of satin” in a cry for the rights of queer+ communities to live “unshamed”. It’s still hard to listen to without getting a lump in the throat.And a Voice to Sing With: A Memoir, by Joan Baez (1987)Baez’s autobiography is wry, witty and refreshingly candid on clashes with Dylan and within her marriage, her commercial flops, and the unglamorous realities of activist life.Joan Baez’s Fighting Side, by David Browne, Rolling Stone (2017)Baez is in puckish spirits in this evocative and funny profile, holding forth on dating Steve Jobs in the 1980s, blaming a bad album cover on her quaaludes phase and showing off her new bling.Joan Baez5: Sleeve notes, by Langston Hughes (1964)Hughes’s essay on Baez is as brilliant as you’d expect from the Harlem renaissance legend. It’s part autobiography, part poetic interpretations of her music. “When she is singing, so uniquely – she becomes the song – and it is hers,” he wrote. “And therefore artlessly, art.”• What is your favourite Joan Baez recording?

This would make a successful negotiation nearly impossible.The December timeline for agreeing a deal with the EU “which was already hopelessly optimistic” was described as “like fantasy land”, by one source. The UK can agree with the EU to extend the transition period by up to one or two years, if necessary, but Downing Street insisted it would not do so.The planned schedule of negotiating rounds on the future relationship was abandoned after the first week due to the pandemic. The UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, will speak to his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, next week to try to agree a new timetable and method for the talks.Barnier is recovering after contracting coronavirus but Johnson remains in intensive care with the disease.Germany takes over the rolling EU presidency on 1 July from Croatia. It will be responsible for chairing key meetings and finding compromise positions on issues, including Brexit.However, the German ambassador to the EU wrote that it would not be possible to look beyond the need to rebuild the EU economy.He said: “From now on, the focus will be on the ability of the European institutions to act, crisis management, exit and reconstruction – possibly maintaining the EU integration itself. The success of our presidency will be measured against this.”Clauss said other key issues would “inevitably be overlaid or completely receded” as the EU’s ability to act will “remain broadly limited until further notice”, according to the letter leaked to German magazine Der Spiegel.Due to physical distancing rules, which are likely to remain even when lockdowns across Europe are lifted, the usual 21 boardrooms available for internal negotiations will be reduced to five. These will have to be shared with the EU’s foreign affairs wing, the European External Action Service.“The council secretariat strongly recommends planning only with one video conference per day,” the letter said. It added that the EU was having to use a commercially available end-to-end encryption service.Four new video conferencing systems set up in the European parliament are also said not to meet the required level of confidentiality.The ambassador wrote: “Video conferences, even if they can be carried out, will not be able to replace physical meetings on an equal footing. No formal quorum, no marginalised conversations, no confidentiality of the negotiations, no interpreting. Difficulties in text work.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/faf4399628a51ef4523b340eed74678974c994fe/0_87_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9de7c411f64902acaf3fef3dcdb6cf78","title":"london pottery finds reveal shoreditch agricultural past","story":"Radiocarbon test of early Neolithic remains can pinpoint dates to a human life  5,500 years agoIt is perhaps best-known for its hipsters, but long before Shoreditch became avant garde, it was a place of agriculture and farmers according to evidence from a radiocarbon dating technique that has revealed details about Neolithic London.The technique proved that the most significant early Neolithic pottery discovered in London is 5,500 years old. It reveals for the first time that the city’s prehistoric inhabitants led a less mobile, farming-based lifestyle than their hunter-gathering forebears.The research, published in Nature, reveals that an area around Shoreditch High Street was once populated by farmers herding their livestock across a once-green landscape. They were possibly linked to migrant groups who first introduced farming to Britain from continental Europe around 4,000 BC.Jon Cotton, a consultant prehistorian working for MOLA (Museum of London Archaeology), said: “This remarkable collection helps to fill a critical gap in London’s prehistory. Archaeological evidence for the period after farming arrived in Britain rarely survives in the capital, let alone still in-situ. This is the strongest evidence yet that people in the area later occupied by the city and its immediate hinterland were living a less mobile, farming-based lifestyle during the early Neolithic period.”He added: “It seems quite likely that these people were semi-nomadic, but settling from time to time in various spots and very much geared around the herding of animals.”The technique, developed by scientists at the University of Bristol, is so accurate that it can pinpoint dates to a human life . It has enabled fatty residues absorbed within the porous walls of the prehistoric pots to be extracted and analysed.The study of long-expired milk fats and other microscopic food remains confirms they once held cattle and sheep or goat dairy products, including butter and cheese. Such foodstuffs could easily be stored during winter months. There was also evidence of stewed meat, including beef and mutton.Although the pottery is now in hundreds of fragments, some still bear the fingertip impressions of their original creators.The collection was discovered by archaeologists from MOLA while excavating the site of a Roman cemetery at Principal Place, an extensive development in Shoreditch.Prof Richard Evershed, who headed the University of Bristol team, said: “Being able to directly date archaeological pots is one of the ‘Holy Grails’ of archaeology. This new method is based on an idea I had going back more than 20 years … We made several earlier attempts to get the method right, but it wasn’t until we established our own radiocarbon facility in Bristol that we cracked it.”Evidence of early Neolithic houses have been found at Horton in Berkshire, Cranford in Hounslow, and Gorhambury in the Colne Valley, and archaeologists believe the pottery from Principal Place suggests a similarly significant settlement.Judging from those slightly earlier sites, Cotton said the people who created the Principal Place pottery might also have lived in substantial houses made of timber with thatched roofs.Noting that the pot residues include herding animals, he added that today’s crowded urban site of Shoreditch High Street was once the upper part of the Walbrook Valley, close to running fresh water and immediate resources for flocks and herds. He said: “You might have to imagine some small clearing within a wooded environment. It was a good place to live.”Previous Neolithic remains discovered in urban central London barely extend beyond a few fragments of pottery and stone axes.Cotton said: “So this site provides the first solid evidence for the presence of people within the area of the city and its immediate environs. This is the largest group of prehistoric pottery in situ from that area. You can count the amount of prehistoric pottery from the city hitherto on the fingers of virtually one hand.”The pottery features 436 fragments from at least 24 separate vessels. Some had been decorated by pressing fingertips or roe deer hooves into the clay – revealing that, even at this early date, people cared about the look as well as the function of their tableware."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed246ee52ad419dbc9777baefc448e8ac78bdc9b/0_250_2962_1778/master/2962..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d934f800317a24f17f1dccd35c9ed5b4","title":"tell us have you found a new job during the coronavirus pandemic","story":"We would like to hear from people who are newly employed in jobs that have become ever more essential due to the lockdownThousands of new jobs delivering food and medicines, working in supply chains and in supermarkets have been created during the coronavirus pandemic.People who have been furloughed from their jobs or fired altogether will have filled some of these roles, along with the previously unemployed.We would like to hear from the people with new jobs doing essential work who have never worked in those areas before.What is your new job?

The co-founder of one food bank shares her diary of its journey during the Covid-19 crisis When my job running the media team for a music festival was put on hold two weeks ago, it meant I had time to help my mum, Jacqui, keep our local food bank open during the coronavirus outbreak.Ten years ago, I helped set up Wadebridge food bank. It was only the second one in the county and many said it was not needed in our affluent area of north Cornwall, beloved of royalty and MPs. Yet it has fed 28,000 people since it opened and, last year, my mum received an MBE for her tireless commitment to serving those in need. But she is 68 and many of her volunteers are older. Even before the government-imposed lockdown, demand had skyrocketed and volunteers had stepped back. We’ve had to roll out new processes overnight to get supplies to the people who need it most. This is our journey.Food bank is technically closed today, but it’s my last child-free day before schools shut, so we’re planning furiously. We’ve set up hand sanitisers and restricted access. Government and Trussell Trust guidelines are changing daily. People are stripping the supermarkets bare, but they’re donating huge amounts of food – which is a relief, as we know we’ll need it in the weeks to come.Today’s recommendation is a 72-hour quarantine for donated food, to minimise the chance of infection via a packet of pasta (if we ever see one of those again). Our premises are too small for our normal needs, let alone this. We’ve been raising funds for somewhere larger for a while, but we need more space today. Mum calls the estate agent. Later, we are loaned a shop for storage. It’s astoundingly generous – and just in time. We get a call from the National Trust offering us boxes of Easter goodies and 600 chocolate eggs.Schools have closed and our administrator has brought her children in with her. We’re key workers, but plans are still being finalised for their tiny school of 51 children, so they’re sharing her office chair while she perches on a stool and fields phone calls.Usually a referral agency – such as social services, a school or a doctor’s surgery – issue a paper voucher, which a client brings to a food bank and exchanges for food. This ensures that long-term support is offered as well as crisis help. Now that agencies are working remotely, issuing paper vouchers isn’t possible. Should they email us? Can clients just come to pick up food? Our normal systems are no longer fit for purpose and we’re not sure of the best way forward. Demand is surging and it’s difficult to know whether this is the new normal or temporary panic.Businesses across town are closing. Costa Coffee offers us leftover milk. Local bakeries donate bread. We plug in every freezer we have.My husband calls a crisis meeting after Boris Johnson announces a lockdown. My parent’s annexe is connected to our house. We agree to operate as one, seeing as we’re working together, but we need a plan to protect us and ensure the food bank can still operate. We agree to close for the day. This is a critical incident, my husband says. Plan well and you’ll get through it.Our administrator spends the day on the telephone to the Trussell Trust, which we are part of, implementing an e-referral system to replace physical vouchers. Almost half of our 60 volunteers have resigned. They’re heartbroken but can’t continue. Their children insist they shield. Thankfully, we’ve had new offers of help: an influx of working-age people like me, whose day jobs are redundant, including a father and his 18-year-old son, now no longer sitting his A-levels.We restructure and draw up new rotas. We have a small team of (mainly retired) volunteers at our central Wadebridge hub. It usually opens four mornings a week, with four people processing food and two in the office. It’s cramped when everyone is in, so to allow for social distancing we split into pairs and add an afternoon shift. Only one person in the office at a time. To build in resilience, everyone is allocated one shift a week, including Mum. The rest must be done from home. We slot new volunteers into the gaps, placing them alongside old hands to train them on the job in case people get sick or drop out.We reopen, but as a different type of food bank. We are now delivery-only. As well as food collection points, we also ran drop-ins which provided a cup of tea, a friendly listening ear and signposting to other services. Closing them is a big loss. But limiting public contact is a necessary step. Our drivers will deliver boxes to each location twice weekly as usual, and from there new teams will oversee delivery within each town, calling ahead and leaving boxes on doorsteps.Some of our volunteers are struggling with their reduced shifts. Some have learning difficulties or mental health problems. For many, volunteering is a lifeline. They miss the camaraderie and structure that it gives them. Distancing ourselves – from each other and the people we serve – is tough for us all. We’re a family, a unit, a vital part of our community. But health and safety come first.Going into the second week of lockdown, standard food boxes remain unchanged – three days’ worth of dried and tinned food – but it’s the extras that are usually offered in person, such as nappies, toiletries, pet food and fresh food, that are harder to manage now. A local hotel delivers a van full of produce. Trying to bag it for delivery adds another layer of complexity. We know that these donations won’t continue for ever, so we eke them out as best we can.We get in to find more deliveries scheduled than food boxes prepared. We work solidly for an hour but we’re still behind when the driver arrives. Systems obviously still need tweaking – this may mean some people have to wait longer for food, and we may need to add a third delivery slot.The driver covers 52 miles across three towns, delivering 28 food boxes to two distribution points, collecting donations from five supermarkets and picking up 16 boxes of Cornish pasties from a wholesaler. Iniduals are still donating food via supermarkets, but much less than last week – perhaps because they are shopping less or collection boxes have been moved as supermarkets rearrange store layouts for social distancing. Like everyone, we’re desperately short of tinned tomatoes and pasta.We’ve fed 135 people this week – double the number for the same period last year – and given out 800kg more food in March than we’ve received, dipping into the reserves of food built up at Christmas. Family referrals have increased the most, mainly from school support workers. They include parents who have to stop work to care for children, those already on low incomes who have lost shifts, and new referrals from the self-employed, many of whom never thought they would need a food bank. Cornwall has one of the lowest GDPs in the country and a highly seasonal, fragile economy. Government help will still take weeks to come through. Like supermarkets, we’re working around the clock to implement change and increase capacity so that we can continue to get food to the most vulnerable. Unlike supermarkets, we are not multinational corporations. Operating on a shoestring, run by volunteers and reliant on donations, if analysts’ predictions are correct and unemployment doubles, we may not be able to provide all that is being asked of us.Our area manager, Emma Greenwood, who has been working non-stop to support the 26 food banks in the south-west, sends us a request. She wants to know how long we can continue to meet demand before current stock runs out. We estimate about six weeks.The Trussell Trust is working at a national level with supermarkets to secure corporate donations – so far, most of the large chains have announced multimillion-pound support packages – but we’re not sure how it will trickle down to inidual food banks and whether it will compensate for the drop in inidual donations that we saw last week.“I’m not sure how to put it into words,” she says when I ask her what the picture looks like across the region. “I’m just so bowled over and proud – and a little emotional.

The yodelling tone, the semi-scripted big lines. It always seemed a bit much.Even that stone cold Motson classic, “the Crazy Gang have beaten the Culture Club”, was basically quite weird, an unexplained zigzag into sexually androgynous New Romantic cod-reggae in the moment of Wimbledon’s FA Cup final triumph. “The Crazy Gang have beaten the Rat Pack.” That might have been better, but only if we really must have an underdog 1950s British comedy troupe riff at this point.But Motson on Brazil was always brilliant. He was there at all the big World Cup moments. Each time you felt he really did love Brazilian football, that the oddly sensuous, flushed round of gurgles and squawks came from a genuine place.Spain 1982 was the last really captivating version of those premodernity, pre-Nike Brazil teams. Defeat to Italy was epic-scale and oddly heartbreaking. Mainly, though, it looks now like the end of something.Not that anyone really got that at the time. The game was an instant, indelible classic. It had two of the best World Cup teams in two of the best World Cup kits. It had Motson on the BBC in prime full-warble mode. It had the best scoreline, 3-2, lodged perfectly in between overly chaotic goal-madness and just enough goal-madness.And it had something beautiful, too, Brazil’s team of all the No 10s broken like a butterfly on a wheel by the gristlier, more industrial football of Italy’s champions-in-waiting.Telê Santana’s team had won their three first group stage games by an aggregate of 10-2. For this game they had a dream midfield of Cerezo-Falcão, with Sócrates and Éder ahead of them, plus Zico, the perfect No 10, just off the front man. Who was, as it happened, a bludgeon in a team of scalpels. “When Serginho plays, the ball is square,” one Brazilian journalist wrote.By contrast, Italy had Paolo Rossi, recently returned from a match-fixing ban and a ghost in his three goalless games at Spain 82 to that point. But he opened the scoring after five minutes in Barcelona with a header from a fine cross by Antonio Cabrini. The defending was terrible.Brazil were level seven minutes later through a piece of fantasy on the right. Sócrates gave the ball to Zico, then ambled forward at a regal sprint. Zico Cruyff-spun away from Claudio Gentile and nudged a through pass that cut three defenders out. Sócrates breezed on. He waited, breezed on a bit more, then shot low past Dino Zoff, the ball kicking up a startling puff of dust as it crossed the line.Sócrates was mobbed: huge gangly arms outstretched, perfectly Grecian, impossibly wise and scorer now of a goal summed up the philosophy of Brazilian football. Although Motson slightly muddled that by adding: “How to play when you’re behind!” which didn’t make much sense, or sum up any obvious philosophy, but you got the idea.Parity didn’t last long. With 25 minutes gone Cerezo gave the ball straight to Rossi. He ran on a few yards. The shot was straight down the middle. Waldir Peres ed out of the way.Brazil fretted and pressed and produced wonderful phases of attacking play. Gentile fouled Zico six times and even ripped a huge chunk out of his shirt. Brazil equalised after half-time, Falcão king a shot into the top corner and veering off in a classic sinew‑straining celebration. A draw would suffice for Brazil.But six minutes later Italy were ahead again as Rossi completed a fairly low-grade hat-trick, poking in from three yards. Brazil pressed but with a steadily depleting sense of destiny.Italy went on to beat Poland 2-0 in their semi, Rossi scoring both goals, then played their best football in a 3-1 defeat of West Germany in the final.Four years on, the spine of that Brazil team, creaking now but with a brilliant centre-forward in Careca, tried to right the agonising defeat of Barcelona. This time they lost agonisingly to France instead. Zico came on, semi-injured, and missed a penalty. Sócrates looked sad and drawn.Brazil would win the World Cup again but their football was never quite the same again. Meanwhile, that game at Eyol’s old Sarrià Stadium continues to spin in space, a perfect little sporting miniature."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14859a73487f73a0adb4e58d9ffc4978a5f52b86/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fd6e40332d1e4893640412a52881c53","title":"sports quiz stories behind iconic photos","story":"You have seen the pictures of Bolt, Pelé, Woods, Maradona and more but can you remember the details behind the images?More quizzes: assists, commentators, managers and rants"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/917e351f33796812b0717cdf6225f422a201f6b4/0_477_1252_751/master/1252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=935d6109021e7d7e4023ebf3011ba160","title":"wisden 2020 offers plenty scope cricket loving self isolators ben stokes","story":"The little yellow monster is coronavirus-free and references the summer of Ben Stokes and the much-missed Bob WillisHere is a timely arrival for cricket lovers. What better way to self-isolate than to escape into some of the 1,536 pages of this year’s Wisden? The 157th edition has just been published, the only problem that remains is distributing the little yellow monster, which in every other year heralds the arrival of the season.The Wisden of 2020, like the Archers and Desert Island Discs, is unsullied by the coronavirus epidemic, which is likely to be a source of relief.In time this edition could well become a collector’s item – like those of 1982 or 2006 – since it covers a summer of momentous cricket that includes a bizarre World Cup victory and that match at Headingley. The 2021 edition will be even more collectable – and maybe more challenging for the editor, Lawrence Booth, since it will be recording a year notable for the absence of much cricket.Unsurprisingly, Ben Stokes keeps popping up. He receives the award of leading cricketer in the world, the first Englishman to win it since Andrew Flintoff in 2006. Stokes made Booth’s job more straightforward and there is a hint of gratitude in the editor’s observation: “Without him this almanack might have been another English hard luck story. Instead it’s a celebration.”Oddly the five cricketers of the year section contains just one English player, Jofra Archer. Perhaps that is why Booth feels the need to give us an explanation of his choices, which I do not think has happened before. This is one of the few bits we do not need in the almanack. The editor does not have to justify his decisions he just has to deliver them and then the rest of us can start arguing or speculating how he opted for his chosen five, a process which is always complicated by the fact that no one can win this award twice.As ever Booth’s notes are elegant and forceful. Unsurprisingly he wants a bigger TV audience for the big events – like the World Cup – and a retention of five-day Test cricket. He conjures up the notion of “Schrödinger’s bat” when contemplating the World Cup final result (maybe he could have explained that and maybe that phrase will resurface in Private Eye).There are some lovely memories of Bob Willis from his great friend Paul Allott as well as a comprehensive account of his life in cricket in the obituary section, which, as ever, contains some wonderful vignettes.In proximity we find “Mugabe, Robert Gabriel” and “Moss, Alan Edward” and it is reassuring that five times more space is devoted to Moss. Mugabe has some connection with cricket – he met Mark Nicholas on England A’s 1990 tour of Zimbabwe Moss, the son of a policeman from Tottenham, played 307 games for Middlesex and nine times for England as a wholehearted pace bowler.May was resistant to any change in the old order, it seems. He crops up in Colin Schindler’s fine piece about the Stop the Tour campaign of 50 years ago. Emotions ran high over whether the South African tour to England in 1970 should take place. “David Sheppard, Bishop of Woolwich and an advocate of cancellation, attempted to arrange a conciliatory meeting,” writes Schindler. “Peter May, his Cambridge friend and former colleague, replied bluntly there was nothing to talk about … His relationship with May never recovered.”There are treasures galore to be discovered, all meticulously gathered and utterly trustworthy except on pages 1500-1508, which are devoted to the 2020 fixture list."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b169a0b3b992468ebfde8e7bf1ef2f62819f3ab1/563_241_2327_1396/master/2327.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e9f23e4975db1b25a897a80ef27be64","title":"incontinence how women are regaining bladder control","story":"Conversation around the side-effects of menopause is changing thanks to celebrities speaking out – so why do we still avoid talking about bladder weakness?Night sweats, mood swings – language around the menopause is all rather negative and even, some might say, derogatory. It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

It takes the stories of queer people of colour from New York in the 80s and puts them front and centre, which is something that hasn’t really been done before. Looking at Ru Paul’s Drag Race, the jokes and references are rooted in Paris Is Burning and the ball culture that Pose showcases. It’s a historic timepiece, but fun and beautiful to watch. Many of the actors and writers are also from the queer and trans communities.The show that has been getting me through the lockdown is The Simpsons (Disney+All4). It might not be queer or gay, really, but it is a little bit, right? It discusses serious issues, but in an irreverent way, which makes it very comforting, because we’re dealing with a lot of serious, scary stuff, so ending the day with some levity and nonsense is a nice tonic.The first show you have to watch is The Vivienne Takes on Hollywood, which premieres on BBC Three on 9 April. It’s a tongue-in-cheek mockumentary about me going over to Los Angeles to make my music video, rubbing shoulders with all these Hollywood types. It’s everything you’d expect to see and more from The Vivienne, this little drag queen from Liverpool, trying to find her feet on Hollywood Boulevard.For a series that’s camp, fun and easy to binge-watch, Next in Fashion (Netflix) is like Ru Paul’s Drag Race meets Project Runway. It showcases these amazing designers, who are really established and good at their craft, but have always worked in the shadow of celebrities and big labels, giving them the opportunity to make their names.Sadly, Ru Paul’s AJ and the Queen (Netflix) hasn’t been renewed for a second season, but it’s a heartfelt show with some great drag cameos. The story is all about heart and forgiveness and proving you’re never too old to learn, even from a 10-year-old. The best episode? Obviously episode seven, starring yours truly and Monique Heart. I play the “entrepreneur” Fabergé Legs – drag queen, club owner and manufacturer of counterfeit goods.I love cartoons and Family Guy (HuluNow TV) touches on every issue imaginable. I mean, Quagmire’s dad is an army veteran who’s also a transsexual woman! Back in 2009, the show even predicted Caitlyn Jenner’s transition. Check out the episode We Love You, Conrad, from the seventh season.The show I’ve been watching non-stop is The Golden Girls (HuluAmazon Prime). Just hearing Rose say something stupid and Dorothy snapping back at her gives me this feeling of comfort – probably because I’ve watched it so many times. Why do gay men love this show? Well, it’s about four very different, sassy, funny, independent women. And there’s nothing gay men love more than strong women.If you haven’t seen Fortune Feimster: Sweet and Salty (Netflix), check it out. Feimster is a lesbian comedian with a terrific brand of comedy and storytelling. She’s joy-filled and joyous to watch, with this charming southern drawl, and she represents part of the queer community that doesn’t get enough visibility. Women in showbusiness already have a major uphill battle – and then add her sexuality to that. This woman has been working her entire life and is just starting to become known.Also, Glee (Netflix) is one to rewatch. It has great storylines – like Kurt coming out – and a fantastic cast of colour and ability. It’s ersity in your face! Remember, Glee made Ryan Murphy mainstream, and that led to American Horror Story, which led to Pose. So without Glee, we wouldn’t have Pose.RuPaul’s Drag Race is on VH1 in the US and Netflix in the UK"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/362606ff948c64fdec01dbec0bc85188de957776/0_99_1902_1141/master/1902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2dcfb658b6235e63875e9392a829354f","title":"twin peaks david lynch television","story":"David Lynch’s surprise small screen outing remains one of the most fascinating and compelling pilot episodes ever madeFor cinephiles of a certain generation, the premiere of Twin Peaks on 8 April 1990 was a seismic event in popular culture, the sort of experience where you remember exactly where you were when you saw it. I was a senior in high school, working at a movie theater in suburban Atlanta, and I watched it alongside a concessionist with whom I used to trade enthusiasms about Marin Scorsese and Brian De Palma, and David Lynch’s Blue Velvet, which we had smuggled under our parents’ noses at the video store. It was the one and only time I’d ever spend at his house, and I don’t recall a word spoken between us until it was over. It was like nothing we had ever seen on television, and like nothing we had ever seen in a theater either.Yet there are two important things about the pilot that tend to get forgotten over time. One is that Twin Peaks did not start as the cult phenomenon it would become later, as diehard fans clung to the series through diminishing ratings and a 1992 feature, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, that caught the zeitgeist too late. The pilot was a bonafide smash, the highest-rated of the 1989-90 season and the fifth ranked show of the week, and about 35 million Americans tuned into ABC to watch it. For perspective, only two primetime telecasts in 2019 had a higher viewership, and they were both football games. It was an impossible (and fleeting) moment when art infiltrated the mainstream, and the Sunday night mystery that introduced characters such as the Log Lady and Nadine, the eyepatch-wearing housewife with a drape obsession.The other surprise, revisiting the pilot, is how emotion defines it as much as eccentricity. Twin Peaks is remembered as a strange show, and it would certainly get stranger as its mythology spun out over three seasons and a movie. The death of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) would become a Lynchian mystery box that had no bottom, just an unending series of dark and surreal revelations about a secret, insinuating evil that lurked on the edges of an idyllic north-western town. But in the pilot, it’s treated more simply as a tsunami of grief that crashes over its characters, who have never experienced losing one of their own, which makes it seem like a sudden death in the everyone’s family. It’s not just Laura’s mother, Sarah (Grace Zabriskie), who breaks down in inconsolable anguish, but the high school principal delivering the news over the PA system and poor Andy (Harry Goaz), the crime scene photographer.Four years earlier, Lynch had explored similar territory with Blue Velvet, which emphasized the innocence of small-town America in an opening sequence of shimmering green lawns and red roses, and a gleaming fire truck with a Dalmatian on the sideboard. Out of sight was a severed ear and some terrible, unacknowledged truths about what was happening in the shadows, and the arc of the film is Kyle MacLachlan’s naive hero confronting that darkness – and finding some of it within himself. In Twin Peaks, as in Blue Velvet, the concepts of good and evil and innocence and guilt are contrasted as sharply as those red roses against a white picket fence, where the distinction really pops.Lynch and the show’s co-creator, Mark Frost, would have plenty of time to drift into the darkness, including the extra-dimensional terror within The Black Lodge, but the pilot puts a premium on collective decency. The fisherman who discovers the body, Pete Martell (Jack Nance), can’t bring himself to look at who has washed up onto the shoreline. All he can say, famously, to the police is, “She’s dead … wrapped in plastic,” and hide behind a rock as Sheriff Truman (Michael Ontkean) and the coroner, Dr Will Hayward (Warren Frost), peel back a layer to reveal her identity. (Hayward later refuses to perform the autopsy due to his close relationship to Laura, who’s his daughter’s best friend.)As the news spreads from Sheriff Truman to the rest of the town, the grief spiderwebs out from the source. There’s no more affecting and brilliantly staged moment in the pilot than Leland Palmer (Ray Wise) fielding an emergency call at the Great Northern from his frantic wife, who had spent the morning searching for their daughter, and Truman’s police truck pulling up in the background behind him. Nothing needs to be said: Truman merely asking for Leland and the silence on the phone line makes it clear enough to the Palmers that Laura is dead, and it’s left to Zabriskie’s screams and the swells of Angelo Badalamenti’s score to carry the emotions from there.The scene at the high school is equally elegant. Lynch has to introduce several major characters: Laura’s erratic boyfriend Bobby (Dana Ashbrook), the chief suspect, who’s seeing a married waitress, Shelly (Mädchen Amick) on the side her best friend Donna (Lara Flynn Boyle) her secret squeeze James (James Marshall) and Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn), a sultry chaos agent whose dad owns the Great Northern. Yet Laura’s loss is registered by her absence, an empty desk before roll call and some looks exchanged between Donna and James as their teacher is summoned to the hallway. The choked-up announcement from the principal (“Before we leave, I want to ask each of you to join me in a moment of silence for Laura and her dear memory”) is echoed later at the sawmill, where Josie Packard decides to shut down production. “Perhaps you can spend the day with your families,” she says.And almost all of this happens before the first commercial break, and before Agent Dale Cooper (MacLachlan) turns up raving about the cherry pie at the Lamplighter and the fantastic Douglas fir trees in the area. Throughout the series’ run, there was so much talk about the cinematic qualities of Twin Peaks that not enough respect was given to how Lynch and Frost conceived it for television. The pilot is structured with commercial interruptions in mind, so viewers could carry certain images with them during the break: the portrait shot of Laura Palmer in happier times, Cooper pulling the letter R from under a victim’s fingernail, a reflection of James’ motorcycle in Laura’s eyes on a piece of video, a cut to the other half of an incriminating heart necklace.It’s clear from watching Twin Peaks that Lynch and Frost were dedicated students of the primetime soap opera, and were drawing from its immense melodramatic pull as much as they were subverting it. The show lasted as long as it did as a network phenomenon because they teased out “Who killed Laura Palmer?” as a parallel universe version of “Who shot JR?” and jammed up the plot with love triangles and florid acts of betrayal and revenge. Part of it was about keeping viewers on the line while they smuggled stranger and more abstract ideas onto the show, but there’s also a genuine affection here for longstanding television conventions and the potential of serialization to lead the writers deeper down the rabbit hole.Of course, there are still plenty of delectably weird standalone moments in the pilot, where Lynch and Frost trail off into offhand bits of poetry or small obsessions and enthusiasms. When Donna asks her little sister to cover for her while she sneaks out past curfew, she first has to answer which phrase she likes better, “the blossom of the evening” or “the full flower of the evening”. As part of his pitch to a group of Norwegian investors, Audrey’s father echoes a guest’s comment about his morning walk: “My airsacks have never felt so good.” And then there’s the general pattern of Agent Cooper’s dialogue, which pivots sharply between dazzling insight into the cases and non sequiturs about Douglas firs and the virtues of a clean, reasonably priced hotel.“You know why I’m whittling?” Cooper ask Sheriff Truman on a stakeout. “That’s what you do in a town when a yellow light means slow down, not speed up.” Of all the memorable lines in the Twin Peaks pilot, that one might be the closest to a thesis statement. The show wouldn’t work if Cooper’s words had even a whiff of insincerity to them. Lynch and Frost believe in towns like Twin Peaks, and they believe in the closeness of communities that are rattled by tragedies of this magnitude. There may be pockets of evil under the surface, but there’s also a goodness that’s worth nurturing and protecting. To say nothing of a damn good cup of coffee."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d739bbf7f21e310c569c303c32774f63c8992a9/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e976553713b29de992cead2268de93a","title":"amsterdam doughnut model mend post coronavirus economy","story":"Dutch officials and British economist to use guide to help city thrive in balance with planetA doughnut cooked up in Oxford will guide Amsterdam out of the economic mess left by the coronavirus pandemic.While straining to keep citizens safe in the Dutch capital, municipality officials and the British economist Kate Raworth from Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute have also been plotting how the city will rebuild in a post-Covid-19 world.The conclusion? Out with the global attachment to economic growth and laws of supply and demand, and in with the so-called doughnut model devised by Raworth as a guide to what it means for countries, cities and people to thrive in balance with the planet.Raworth’s 2017 bestselling book, Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist, has graced the bedside table of people ranging from the former Brexit secretary David Davis to the  columnist George Monbiot, who described it as a “breakthrough alternative to growth economics”.The inner ring of her donut sets out the minimum we need to lead a good life, derived from the UN’s sustainable development goals and agreed by world leaders of every political stripe. It ranges from food and clean water to a certain level of housing, sanitation, energy, education, healthcare, gender equality, income and political voice. Anyone not attaining such minimum standards is living in the doughnut’s hole.The outer ring of the doughnut, where the sprinkles go, represents the ecological ceiling drawn up by earth-system scientists. It highlights the boundaries across which human kind should not go to avoid damaging the climate, soils, oceans, the ozone layer, freshwater and abundant bioersity.Between the two rings is the good stuff: the dough, where everyone’s needs and that of the planet are being met.On Wednesday, the model will be formally embraced by the municipality of Amsterdam as the starting point for public policy decisions, the first city in the world to make such a commitment.“I think it can help us overcome the effects of the crisis”, said Amsterdam’s deputy mayor, Marieke van Doorninck, who joined Raworth in an interview with the  via Skype before the launch. “It might look strange that we are talking about the period after that but as a government we have to … It is to help us to not fall back on easy mechanisms.”“When suddenly we have to care about climate, health, and jobs and housing and care and communities, is there a framework around that can help us with all of that?” Raworth says. “Yes there is, and it is ready to go.”The central premise is simple: the goal of economic activity should be about meeting the core needs of all but within the means of the planet. The “doughnut” is a device to show what this means in practice.Raworth scaled down the model to provide Amsterdam with a “city portrait” showing where basic needs are not being met and “planetary boundaries” overshot. It displays how the issues are interlinked.“It is not just a hippy way at looking at the world,” says Van Doorninck, citing the housing crisis as an example.Van Doorninck says the city plans to regulate to ensure builders use materials that are as often possible recycled and bio based, such as wood. But the doughnut approach also encourages policymakers to lift their eyes to the horizon.“The fact that houses are too expensive is not only to do with too few being built. There is a lot of capital flowing around the world trying to find an investment, and right now real estate is seen as the best way to invest, so that drives up prices,” she says.“The doughnut does not bring us the answers but a way of looking at it, so that we don’t keep on going on in the same structures as we used to.”The port of Amsterdam is the world’s single largest importer of cocoa beans, mostly from west Africa, where the labour is often highly exploitative.As an independent private company it could reject such products and take the economic hit, but at the same time almost one in five households in Amsterdam qualify for social benefits due to low incomes and savings.Van Doorninck says the port is looking at how it moves on from dependence on fossil fuels as part of the city’s new vision, and she expects that to naturally evolve into a wider debate over other pressing dilemmas brought to the forefront by the doughnut model.“It gives space to talk about whether you want to be the place where products are being stored that are produced by child labour or by other forms of labour exploitation,” she says.Raworth adds: “Who would expect in a portrait of the city of Amsterdam that you would include labour rights in west Africa? And that is the value of the tool.”Both recognise the need for national government and supranational authorities to get on board. Raworth’s last meeting just before the lockdown in Belgium was with the European commission in Brussels, where she says great interest was expressed.“The world is experiencing a series of shocks and surprise impacts which are enabling us to shift away from the idea of growth to ‘thriving’, Raworth says. “Thriving means our wellbeing lies in balance. We know it so well in the level of our body. This is the moment we are going to connect bodily health to planetary health.”•\u0026nbspThis article was amended on 8 April 2020 to remove a superfluous zero from the figure of online applications for social housing, which is 60,000.

Fijian authorities ordered people to stay indoors and closed all roads on the island of Viti Levu, which is home to the country’s capital of Suva and the bulk of the Pacific nation’s population.Frank Bainimarama, the country’s prime minister warned earlier on Wednesday that “the worst of TC Harold will strike Fiji through this afternoon … Flying debris and floodwaters can be deadly. All Fijians should stay indoors unless directed to evacuate.”Images emerged of flooded streets on the west coast of Viti Levu, and buildings demolished.Harold was expected to hit Tonga in the next 48 hours. The Matangi Tonga website reported that Harold’s arrival in the country would coincide with a king tide and a supermoon early on Thursday morning. An extreme high tide warning was in force for Tonga for Thursday and Friday.Fijian authorities have had days to prepare for the storm, which formed near the Solomon Islands before cutting a destructive path through Vanuatu.The storm has already wreaked a path of destruction through the Pacific.Twenty-seven people are missing and feared dead after being swept off a ferry in rough seas caused by the cyclone in Solomon Islands.The storm hit Vanuatu on Monday and two days later, it is still unclear how badly the country was hit.Communication lines to Vanuatu’s hardest hit islands - Espiritu Santo, Malo and Pentecost among others - were severed by the storm and it’s expected that calmer weather today to bring devastating news of the cyclone’s full devastation.There have been no reports of loss of life, but some pictures of destroyed buildings and flooding have already emerged.Rebuilding efforts will be complicated by the spread of Covid-19, with relief agencies desperately worried how to maintain social distancing measures while carrying out their work.There are currently no confirmed cases of the disease in Vanuatu but the government has placed a ban on inbound flights to help containment efforts.New Zealand’s High Commission in Vanuatu is working on options to get stranded citizens back to New Zealand.A Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson said damage to the northern and central part of Vanuatu was “serious” and New Zealand “stands ready to support the Government of Vanuatu’s response”.AAP contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7106485d3dfd5ccb5e199d6d0727b0e14448e69d/0_428_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=14ecb745f73d3413486286132af770a5","title":"how are you affected by coronavirus in the south west of the uk","story":"If you live in the south-west England or Wales, we’d like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.

The order referred to improvements in the areas of cleaning, ventilation and the sealing of holes in a wall. The prosecution against Camile Thai (Takeaway) at Unit 22, Village Green, Tallaght, Dublin 24 resulted in the business being fined €200 and ordered to pay costs of €922.50. The Food Safety Authority said the prosecution, taken by the HSE, highlighted “the seriousness of providing accurate food allergen information and the importance of complying with the allergens legislation for public health, legal and reputational consequences for food businesses”. Commenting on the enforcement orders Dr Pamela Byrne, chief executive of the authority said “filthy premises, unhygienic practices and poor pest control are all totally unacceptable”. In relation to the HSE prosecution against the Camile Thai restaurant in Tallaght said “ Failure to provide accurate allergen information can have very serious health consequences for people with food allergies. This is a time when our health services are under unprecedented pressure due to Covid-19 and it is vital that they are not put under any additional undue pressure resulting from unsafe food practices.”Details of the food businesses served with Enforcement Orders are published on the FSAI’s website at www.fsai.ie.

If they fail to comply they face arrest, a fine of €2,500 or a six-month jail term. Video: Bryan O\u0027Brien\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNew powers mean gardaí can instruct someone to return home. Failure to comply may result in arrest, a fine of €2,500 or  six-month jail term. Photograph: Collins Gardaí were given new powers to curtail the movement of people last night due to “slippage” in terms of compliance with a requirement that people remain within 2km of their home.Garda Commissioner Drew Harris has sent out regulations that require people to remain at their “place of residence”. The commissioner said this means people who may have travelled to their holiday home are now required to remain within 2km of that property.Earlier on Wednesday it was suggested that gardaí would be able to knock on holiday-home doors over Easter weekend and tell people to go home.The commissioner said this would not be the case and the priority is to restrict movement until Monday night, that people should remain where they are.A decision is expected on Friday on an extension of restrictions concerning movement beyond Easter Sunday. The additional Garda powers were signed into law last night due to concern that complacency was creeping in and could accelerate during a bank holiday weekend with fine weather forecast.The new law allows that a person who refuses to comply with an instruction of a garda who is seeking to impose physical distancing rules is guilty of an offence. The transgression that can lead to arrest and a fine of €2,500 or a prison sentence of up to six months.What is the timeline for these powers?Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said there would be no automatic rollover of the new Garda powers. If the restrictions on people leaving their homes is extended as expected into next week, there would be “careful consideration” around whether to also extend the new powers.Mr Flanagan said it is important gardaí have clarity around enforcement of rules on people remaining at home. And he added that there was also a fear that some people were becoming complacent.The Minister described the regulations as a last resort and said it was hoped the high level of public compliance with the request that people stay within 2km of their home would be maintained.Meanwhile, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has told a party meeting that the public may need to be told when the restrictions introduced to deal with the crisis will be lifted.Mr Martin made the comments during a conference call with his Senators and MEPs on Wednesday morning, during which the Covid-19 crisis and government formation were discussed.‘Playing their part’During a Government update on the pandemic, assistant secretary general at the Department of the Taoiseach Liz Canavan said while the majority of people are “playing their part”, there is a need to “be fair to everyone who is making an effort.”“If we do not stay the course, all of the sacrifices already made and all of the work you’ve put in so far, and all of the work done by our front-line workers to try and suppress this virus won’t be enough,” said Ms Canavan.She urged the public to abide by travel restrictions this bank holiday weekend.While social distancing measures have made a difference, she added, “we are not there yet”.Ms Canavan also said the Government will move to provide certainty on the Junior and Leaving Cert exams in the coming days and she urged students to continue studying.Health restrictionsMinister for Health Simon Harris said it is unlikely public health restrictions will be lifted at the weekend.“If we take the foot off the pedal, the progress we’ve made would be reversed,” he told Newstalk Breakfast.Mr Harris said he did not want to see what had happened in other countries. “If we don’t make more progress we’re going to find ourselves in a difficult situation. We need to reduce the rate of growth.”The country cannot be “normal” this weekend, he warned.“Life is unusual at the moment. The alternative is so much worse that we cannot save the lives we want.”‘Social sabotage’Meanwhile, multiple claims have emerged from residents of seaside towns of people arriving at holiday homes. Co Clare doctor and former Independent TD Michael Harty said anyone who travels to their holiday home this weekend will be committing “social sabotage.”People who don’t have symptoms can still spread the virus and have a devastating impact on others he said. “You should not travel, you could carry the virus into a community that doesn’t have it. Don’t be selfish this weekend.”Dr Harty said visitors will be welcomed with open arms once the pandemic ends.There have now been 210 Covid-19 related deaths in the Republic.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Minister for Health Simon Harris has signed regulations granting the Garda the powers to enforce sweeping restrictions on public movement and bring criminal prosecutions against those failing to comply on Tuesday night.The new powers were included in the emergency coronavirus legislation passed two weeks ago but only became active once the Minister signed them into use. Until now gardaí have been requesting rather than ordering people to comply with the guidelines.Mr Harris has activated the regulations following a meeting with the Garda Commissioner and the Attorney General on Tuesday. It is understood signing of the regulations was delayed as the Government’s lawyers worked out the precise wording and extent of the powers.Gardaí now have the power to arrest and detain those who breach the restrictions. This includes those found exercising beyond 2km from their homes or those travelling for non-essential reasons.Convictions will result in a maximum sentence of six months in prison and a fine of €2,500.Gardaí also have the power to assist the HSE in detaining someone judged to be at risk of spreading the virus who refuses to self isolate. Those refusing to comply with such orders face up to three months in prison.The measures were enacted on Tuesday amid worries the fine weather will attract many people to public spaces over the coming bank holiday weekend.Garda sources say the intention will be to only use the enforcement powers as a last resort, e.g. if someone refuses to return home when directed or are repeatedly caught breaking the regulations.A Garda spokesman repeated on Tuesday that compliance from the public remains high.Record daily deathsEarlier on Thursday the deaths of another 36 patients - 19 males and 17 females - diagnosed with Covid-19 were reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).Some 27 of the deaths were in the east, six in the north and three in the south. Some 24 of the patients were reported as having underlying health conditions. There have now been 210 Covid-19 related deaths in the Republic. The median age of today’s deaths is 81.The NPHET also reported 345 new confirmed cases on Monday. The total number of confirmed cases now stands at 5,709.Tuesday’s number for deaths is a daily record.According to the NPHET, 42,484 tests have been carried out in labs across the country. Almost 40 per cent of tests have been carried out in the last seven days.These tests have resulted in 2,374 positive tests. This means 19 per cent of tests are producing a positive result, up 4 per cent in the past week.Analysis of casesAn analysis of the cases up to last Sunday shows 46 per cent were in men and 53 per cent in women the median age of cases is 48 years. There have been 270 clusters involving 1,103 cases.Of these cases, 1,345 have been hospitalised (24 per cent) and of those hospitalised, 194 were admitted to ICU.A total of 1,338 healthcare workers have now contracted the virus.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said this increase was the result of a more sensitive case definition, which meant people who were more likely to have the disease were tested, including healthcare workers and people in hospital.The NPHET made a direct appeal to the public not to travel unnecessarily over Easter.Expressing concern that a proportion of the population may seek to travel to holiday destinations, holiday homes and mobile homes over the Easter weekend, despite travel restrictions in place since March 27th.It said it was grateful gardai have been “visibly present” on the roads over the past week “assisting the public with compliance”.“Given the mass community transmission of Covid-19 across Europe, the European Centre for Disease Control is expected to advise all EU nationals to keep current restrictions in place.“While current restrictions have reduced the number of people becoming infected by one confirmed case, this depends on people staying at home and following public health advice.”Earlier dataNPHET officials criticised new US research published on Tuesday which suggested Ireland had reached its peak, as unreliable.According to the new international modelling data , Ireland has passed its peak of Covid-19 infections but can expect more than 400 deaths by next month.Peak resource use of hospital and ICU beds passed on April 4th, while peak daily deaths passed on April 6th, according to the data published by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington in the US.The research looks at the predicted spread and impact of coronavirus in 29 European countries and assumes social distancing measures will remain in place until August.“It’s not really a model. It just took existing case data and suggested that because things seem to have stabilised over a short number of days that perhaps we’ve reached a peak,” said assistant chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn.“It doesn’t take into account any changes over the coming days or the highest number of deaths reported this evening.”Dr Glynn said Irish modelling being led by NUI Maynooth president Prof Philip Nolan was using a more extensive range of paramenters and people should wait to see what comes out of this work.Placing “undue store” in the US research could lead to complacency, he warned.The research looks at the predicted spread and impact of coronavirus in 29 European countries and assumes social distancing measures will remain in place until August.It predicts there will be more than 150,000 deaths in Europe during the “first wave” of the pandemic.In relation to Ireland, it says there was “no overall bed shortage” on the peak date, with a shortage of 88 ICU beds. A shortfall of 125 ventilators was also forecast.These calculations were based on the pre-pandemic availability of under 250 ICU beds in the State this capacity has since been at least doubled, indicating an ever greater surplus of capacity under these modelling assumptions.The supply of ventilators has also been boosted.DeathsA total of 401 deaths are forecast in Ireland by the start of May but none thereafter to August 4th, the end of the modelling period, according to the report.The study predicts 66,300 deaths in the UK, the highest in Europe. The UK’s use of bed resources is predicted to peak on April 17th and its deaths on April 20th.It says the peak of the pandemic has passed in many European countries, including Spain, Italy and France, where 19,209, 20,300 and 15,058 deaths are predicted, respectively. The model is based on the social distancing measures introduced in New Zealand and also assumes complete adherence to these measures.It also suggests the end of the first wave of the epidemic could occur by early June and says whether a second wave occurs depends on what is done then to prevent Covid-19 being re-introduced.“By the end of the first wave of the epidemic, an estimated 97 per cent of the population of the US will still be susceptible to the disease and thus measures to avoid a second wave of the pandemic prior to vaccine availability will be necessary.”“It is unequivocally evident that social distancing can, when well implemented and maintained, control the epidemic, leading to declining death rates,” said IHME director Dr Christopher Murray.“Those nations hit hard early on implemented social distancing orders and may have the worst behind them as they are seeing important progress in reducing their death rates. Each nation’s trajectory will change – and dramatically for the worse – if people ease up on social distancing or relax other precautions.“To decrease the risk of a second wave in places where the first wave is controlled by robust social distancing, governments would need to consider mass testing, contact tracing, and quarantines for those infected until a vaccination is available, mass produced, and distributed widely.”RestrictionsThe current restrictions on movement in Ireland, which are due to end on Easter Sunday, will be considered at a NPHET meeting on Friday.Dr Holohan said he wasn’t anticipating any change to these restrictions “at this moment in time”.The team will also consider the public health implications of setting up a childcare scheme to facilitate healthcare workers.The Cabinet is due to meet on Tuesday for an update on the Covid-19 emergency.

Photograph: Ireland’s CallThe world has changed completely since Dr Marianne Hennigan started a four-week holiday in New Zealand in mid-March. Then, governments were waking up to the reality of Covid-19, but it was still a disease mostly confined to China and Europe and not to Australia and New Zealand.Nobody expected the raft of restrictions which would shut down the world in the space of a few weeks. Within a week of her arrival in New Zealand, the bus tour was cancelled and she, along with others on the tour, was forced to self-isolate in Auckland. Dr Hennigan (31), originally from Deansgrange, Co Dublin, was working in Perth at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital as a locum doctor in emergency medicine. Like hundreds of other Irish newly-qualified doctors she found the opportunities and the climate in Perth agreeable and had spent three years there. Her flight back to Perth from Auckland was abruptly cancelled with no replacement available. In this hiatus, she made up her mind not to go back to Perth at all, but leave her car and her possessions there and return to Ireland to work. “In the end of the day it’s just stuff. I really enjoyed working in Perth,” she said. “It was lovely, the biggest thing that I regret is that I didn’t get to say goodbye to any of my friends when I left. I’m sure I will at some point. Unfortunately, none of us really expected what was going to happen.” Her marathon flight home, first to Doha in Qatar, and then to Ireland was facilitated by the Ireland’s Call Initiative which is not to be confused with On Call for Ireland, the HSE call for healthcare professionals, students and volunteers to help tackle coronavirus in Ireland. The Ireland’s Call Initiative was set up by businessman Neil Sands as a philanthropic enterprise to bring doctors and nurses home from abroad and to pay for their flights and accommodation in self-isolation for a fortnight. Ireland’s Call hopes to bring home 100 Irish medics from abroad in the coming months. She is the first to be repatriated under the initiative and one of more than 50,000 people who have offered their services to the HSE since last month. “We are not the real heroes,” she stressed. “The real heroes are the people who have been there from day one. We are the reinforcements. “I am delighted to be home. I was particularly happy to see my mum at the airport. It is just a relief to be coming home for the foreseeable future and that I won’t be stuck. “The main fear is that working in ICU, where it is high-risk, if I were to get sick, my family wouldn’t be able to come out to see me in Perth. At this time you want to be in proximity with your family and around Irish people.” She will need the next fortnight to register for and find work. Her experience in emergency respiratory medicine in Perth will be invaluable for her and for the HSE as it seeks to cope with the pandemic. There will be other business to attend to and making a will is something she feels is necessary given the risks involved. “I think everybody is fearful at this point in time when you see young healthcare workers getting sick and dying,” she said. “It is obvious that I didn’t intend to do it at this stage of my life. It is our profession and it is something that I want to help out. I would much rather be in the front line helping out than being stuck in another country in an Airbnb.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4223951.1586346494!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miche%C3%A1l martin raises need for end point of coronavirus restrictions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has told a party meeting that the public may need to be told when the restrictions introduced to deal with the coronavirus crisis will be lifted.

File photograph: Getty Supports promised for nursing homes by Minister for Health Simon Harris to tackle coronavirus have not materialised to the level expected, Nursing Homes Ireland has said. Chief executive of the representative body Tadhg Daly said there is a gap between what was promised and the reality on the ground concerning personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing for staff. Mr Harris announced a €72 million support package for nursing homes last week including twice-daily staff screening and priority testing in an effort to stem coronavirus outbreaks. “The reprioritisation that we received from the Minister last week was very welcome, but it hasn’t materialised to the level that we would expect. The point we would make is that every day counts now and there is a gap between what was promised and the reality on the ground in two areas,” Mr Daly told RTÉ’s Seán O’Rourke show on Wednesday. “One is the area of PPE. We accept fully that it is a logistical challenge but given the numbers now in nursing homes and given what we’ve been saying in Nursing Homes Ireland we do need that commitment delivered on. “The other area is testing. Our members are crying out for staff and we have staff sitting at home in isolation awaiting tests or awaiting test results. Those are two critical issues and if those were resolved the nursing home sector is well capable of dealing with this particular pandemic.” Mr Daly said the Minister’s commitment to reprioritise healthcare workers had to be delivered. “If it’s not, then I am fearful that the staff that we employ, and that’s in nursing homes right across the health service, won’t be there in the numbers when an even greater surge that’s expected hits the wider health service.” ‘Numbers are rising’Mr Daly said the latest figures from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre that there are 86 clusters of coronavirus in nursing homes as of midnight on Sunday is “very concerning”. “The numbers are rising but we’ve known from the outset that Covid was always going to attack the weakest. But I suppose what we’re confident of is with the right supports given the dedicated and professional staff in the nursing home sector, we’re well able to cope with this,” he added. “I think we need to be conscious here that a cluster is two or more but also the nursing home sector has stepped up. The majority of people with Covid at this point in time are being cared for and being cared for very well I would suggest in the nursing home sector.” Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4223946.1586346761!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"locked down but looking up what to look out for in the night skies right now","story":"The largest, brightest supermoon of 2020 rose in the night sky on Tuesday over hushed cities in lockdown. It will continue to be visible in Irish skies on Wednesday and Thursday. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere is an array of amazing sights to observe in the night sky at the moment. File photograph: Joseph Eid AFPGettyThe coronavirus lockdown has confined many of us to our homes and, if we are lucky, to our back gardens.While human nighttime activity has been severely curtailed, the sky above continues in its imperturbable way.Spring is a great time to be out of doors and looking up at the heavens. There are two caveats. The first is the weather in Ireland which is an occupational hazard for any amateur or professional astronomer. By some estimates just one night a week is completely cloud-free though you should see lots in partially clouded skiesDo make the best of any clear weather that comes along. Ideally, you need to stay out for at least 20 minutes to allow your eyes to adapt to the darkness. You will see a lot more than if you take a quick peek outside or out the window.The other scourge of astronomers is light pollution. In built-up areas light can obscure some of the glories of the heaven most notably the Milky Way. The more rural the location, the more you will see, while sticking to the current coronavirus restrictions of course.Nevertheless, most of the sky’s most prominent objections can be seen even in light polluted skies.Skygazing for beginners is much easier than it used to be. There are a multiplicity of apps that will show you around the sky - we have been using Sky Guide, available on Apple and Android. All you have to do is point your smartphone upwards. Nevertheless, it is good to know what you are looking at.Fortunately, there is much of interest to be seen with the naked eye and with binoculars. These objects can be seen using either. You will need a small telescope to see details on the planets Jupiter, Saturn and Mars which are in the morning sky during the month of April.Moon: The supermoon is quite the sight in the skies this week. The moon’s surface is made up of mountains, craters and “seas” which flat, grey shaped areas which were made when molten lava cooled when the moon was created.The most discernible feature with the naked eye is the figure of eight feature slightly right of centre of the moon. The top part of the eight is the Sea of Serenity and the bottom half is the Sea of Tranquillity. The Sea of Tranquillity is where first moon landing landed on the moon in 1969.Near the bottom of the full moon is the huge crater Tycho which is just about discernible with the naked eye, but is very much visible even in a small pair of binoculars. This is a spray crater which resulted after a huge asteroid struck the moon during its formation. Another crater which is visible slightly above Tycho is Copernicus.VENUS: Venus will be the star of the heavens so to speak for the next month. It is unmistakable as it blazes away in the southern sky from 8.30pm. It looks like a star, but is a planet. If you look through binoculars its light is constant while stars twinkle. A small telescope will reveal that Venus has phases like the moon and can sometimes appear as a crescent.THE PLOUGH: Known also as the Big Dipper, the Plough is the asterism (star pattern) in the sky that everybody knows. It is not a constellation in itself as it forms part of Ursa Major, the Big Bear.The Plough is most distinguished by the mid-star in the handle which is actually a double star (two stars that orbit each other). It used to be a test of visual acuity if you could see two stars not one. They are Alcor and Mizar also known as the horse and rider and they are easily resolvable in a pair of binoculars.POLARIS: The two stars on the pan end of the Plough point directly to Polaris, the North Star. This is the most important star in the sky. It points due north and navigators used it for millennia to determine their longitude. For instance observed from Dublin it is at an angle of 53 degrees to the horizon but at the North Pole it will be directly overhead. It is always in the same place in the sky and the Vikings believed it was a spike around which the universe revolved. In 2008 Nasa sent a radio signal of The Beatles’ Across the Universe in the direction of Polaris. Do not be holding your breath wishing for a response. The message will take 431 years to reach the star and, assuming there is any intelligent life on some of the planets around Polaris, another 431 years for the message to return to Earth.Orion:  Orion, the hunter, is the jewel of the night in the southern sky. Unlike a lot of other constellations, it actually looks like what it is named after. Orion is distinguished by its belt of three diagonal stars. Underneath is a fuzzy patch of sky called the Orion nebula which can be seen clearly in a pair of binoculars. This is a star formation area.In the top left hand corner of Orion is the super red star Betelgeuse. This is one of the largest stars visible to the naked eye. It may not even exist any longer. In February Nasa scientists observed that it had dimmed considerably. This is an indication that it is about to reach the end of its life and blow up into a supernova. That might have already happened. As it takes 700 years for the light from Betelgeuse to reach Earth, we might not know about it yet. Then again it might not blow up for another 100,000 years. Nobody knows for certain when it will erupt into a supernova.Rigel:  At the opposite end to Betelgeuse is the blue supergiant Rigel which is 70 times as big as our sun. Stars vary in colour according to their age and Rigel is another star near the end of its life.Sirius: To the bottom left of Orion is Sirius, the Dog Star, which is the brightest star in the sky. It’s so bright because it is very close in astronomical terms being just 8.6 light years away from Earth. This is all relative given the distances involve. Sirius is 80 trillion kilometres away that’s 80,000,000,000,000 kilometres from Earth. We will not be going there any time soon.The Pleiades: The Pleiades, to the top right hand side of Orion, looks like a fuzzy patch in the sky to the naked eye, but reveal its full glory in a pair of binoculars. With a pair, you can discern a cluster six stars shining through the cosmic gas and dust. This is a star formation nursery where new stars are formed from the cosmic gases surrounding the six stars.Leo: The constellation of Leo (not to be confused with the astrological sign) dominates the spring sky. This is another constellation which looks like what it is supposed to resemble which is a crouching lion."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4206213.1584564281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu sets out proposals for close uk ties after brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and the British prime minister’s Europe adviser David Frost in Brussels on March 2nd. Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4224151.1586359794!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bernie sanders suspends democratic us presidential campaign","story":"US senator Bernie Sanders has suspended his 2020 democratic presidential campaign, according to a statement.

Those stages are:This is the most basic form of hospital therapy for coronavirus patients who have become breathless and are struggling to get enough oxygen into their blood. Patients are fitted with a simple mask and piped oxygen-enriched air to help them along.For the next step, patients are fitted with an airtight mask and the oxygen-air mix they receive is pressurised to help them breathe. At this stage, monitoring of a patient\u0027s vital signs will become more intense. The patient remains conscious.Next, a ventilator is required to push air in and out of the lungs. This is an invasive procedure for which the patient is put to sleep, probably on their front to take the weight of the heart off the lungs. The ventilator keeps the patient alive, giving their body time to fight the virus.This is the option of last resort. It is used when ventilation can no longer get oxygen through the patient’s lungs and into the bloodstream because the lungs have become too damaged and inflamed.ECMO machines bypass the lungs and oxygenate the patient\u0027s blood outside their body before returning to them. It is similar in concept to the heart bypass machines used during open-heart surgery and is one of the most aggressive forms of life support available.The machines are seen as the “last-chance saloon” of respiratory aid, and Guy’s \u0026amp St Thomas’ is one of five centres in the UK that offers ECMO for adults. Others include the Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospital (London), Glenfield Hospital in Leicester, Papworth Hospital in Cambridge and Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester.The World Health Organisation has issued interim guidelines recommending the use of ECMO on Covid-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — respiratory failure when lungs are so ravaged that ventilation is no longer sufficient.The machines,  which costs about £100,000 each, consist of an artificial membrane lung, a pump and a blood warmer — all of which are connected by plastic tubing.Blood is removed from the body, and pumped through the artificial lung, called the oxygenator.  As well as oxygenating the blood, the ECMO machine removes carbon dioxide and warms the blood before then returning it to the patient.ECMO is used for Covid-19 patients suffering from respiratory failure.The patient is given an anaesthetic and a cannulae is placed directly into the femoral vein on the side of the neck (and internal jugular vein if required), which is then connected to the ECMO circuit.The removal of blood from the body can cause it to clot, so a blood-thinning drug called heparin is used. This can result in bleeding throughout the body and the need for blood transfusions.During the outbreak in China, ECMO machines were used on the most severely ill  patients, and in a mid-March webinar sponsored by the American College of Cardiology, doctors from Wuhan advised the west to start ECMO “sooner rather than later”.But ECMO is not a cure it is a life-support measure used to provide relief for the lungs and is only suitable for a small number of patients who are otherwise fit and well. The prognosis for anyone put on an ECMO machine is by definition poor.One reason for failure is its impact on the immune system. Along with the known ECMO complications of bleeding, infection risk, seizures and possible severe neurological damage due to loss of blood supply (ischaemia), a substantial decrease in the number and function of vital infection-fighting white blood cells - called lymphocytes - is common.An ECMO specialist said: “The procedure is risky in itself, because you’re putting blood through a machine full of synthetic surfaces, something blood normally reacts to and that can cause cellular damage and inflammatory response syndrome. The machine also chews up platelets so there can be damage to red blood cells.”While many studies showing high survival rates among ECMO patients in different scenarios have been published, little is known about its success with Covid-19.A small retrospective, observational study by doctors in China published by the American Medical Association in February showed that five out of six (83 per cent) patients with severe Covid-19 who received ECMO died, but doctors have warned against comparing data between China and the UK.“That figure will be a reflection on the rates in that particular hospital, but local variables play a factor such as how patients are isolated and managed, medical protocols that are being followed,” said the specialist. “It’s difficult to extrapolate any real meaning.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"second home owners accused sneaking cover darkness coronavirus","story":"Second home owners have been accused of sneaking into the West Country under cover of darkness as plans emerge for the closure of tourist hotspots over the Easter weekend.Amid warnings that the Government could introduce tougher measures including a ban on exercise if social distancing rules are flouted, some local authorities have called for roadblocks to prevent people flooding to the area over the Bank Holiday.Selaine Saxby, the MP for North Devon, said she had raised the issue of second home owners sneaking into the county with police and ministers as she warned that local services could be swamped.I am deeply disappointed at reports I have heard over the weekend of the ongoing arrival of second home owners under the cover of darkness across the county to avoid roadblocks, and have raised this matter directly with the police as well,” she said.It comes as a number of local authorities have also threatened to close the parks or other beauty spots if people continue to have barbecues or sunbathe.The Greenwich foot tunnel, closed on Sunday after crowds of people used it to cross the Thames, will be closed again over the Bank Holiday or until it can be proven that people are abiding by social distancing measures, the local council said.It comes as ministers consider using scare tactics to warn the public that doctors and nurses could die as they ramp up messaging on the cost that people\u0027s actions are having on the NHS.I think you will start to get those kind of messages coming from Government,” said one Whitehall  source. There was discussion about how much people are observing social distancing. There is an issue of people not being as observant as they were last weekend.The worst of all worlds is having all this economic damage but not actually having the benefit of people observing social distancing.Simon Kempton, the operational policing lead for the Police Federation, said an emotional campaign highlighting the deaths of nurses and doctors from coronavirus was a way to get the minority of refuseniks to want to comply rather than feel they have to.There is a cautious optimism among police chiefs that the lockdown may be having an effect. Police abstraction rate – the number of officers off ill or self-isolating – has dropped slightly, from 13.1 per cent to 12.8 per cent.Nonetheless, they still believe the lockdown, due to be reviewed at the end of next week, will be extended for at least another three weeks on the basis that you have it for longer than you need it rather than have to lift it and have a resurgence, said the source.However, a senior police source said: Easter weekend will knock it one way or another. There is a real disappointment at what happened on the weekend. I believe that if Easter weekend is bad and people flout the restrictions again, they will increase the restrictions – that people will have to stay at home, no excuse, no nothing.Another option is to blitz areas of high non-compliance with police officers and fines. We should go out there and say that, if you are out without a reasonable excuse, you will be fined. We should just lay down the law at the weekend, said a Whitehall source.It came as Dame Cressida Dick, the politan Police Commissioner, said people who refuse to leave public spaces when asked to do so will be forced to by the police.We will always try to advise people to explain, to encourage people to comply and if necessary to move on, not to stop and sunbathe – that\u0027s not exercising or travelling to work or shopping, she said. If we have to, we will be very firm in that if somebody completely refuses – but this is an absolute last resort – it will result in enforcement. She declined to comment on whether tighter restrictions were needed, but addedd: The Met will stand by and be ready to assist whichever direction they go in, whenever that is.Devon councillor Frank Biederman called on his local authority to endorse checkpoints on the region\u0027s main roads to catch people trying to sneak in from cities amid reports that many holiday home owners have already relocated to the county.In Cornwall, there have been more than 200 reports of properties being rented out to holidaymakers despite Government guidance which says that all such activity should have ceased.The council said that a number of AirBnB properties, two glamping sites, guest houses, a campsite, and a holiday cottage letting agency were among those breaking the rules. There have also been calls for AirBnB to scrap reservations whilst the lockdown measures are in place.Brendan O\u0027Hara, the MP for Argyll and Bute, has written to the online booking site to say: Hundreds of people in my constituency and other rural regions have raised serious concerns that tourists are \u0027escaping\u0027 the virus by coming to these areas, and that Airbnb is continuing to allow holidaymakers to reserve holiday accommodation.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus positive good news round up portable priest two","story":"Let’s kick off with the best kind of news – chocolate-related.

How eggciting (apologies all round). Keeping on the theme of the Easter celebrations, a “portable priest” who goes by the name Pat Allerton is spreading some Easter joy by visiting residential streets in London and delivering a 10-minute prayer and hymn through a speaker.The 41-year-old vicar at Notting Hill’s St Peter’s Church said he is following social distancing rules and would stop if the police told him to do so. Come to your window or your doorway and join in the singing, be part of your neighbourhood and community for that brief moment, he said. And who can resist a love story in the time of coronavirus? We’ve already seen weddings on balconies, on the streets and online. Then last week the Archbishop of Canterbury gave one couple special permission to tie the knot.The pair, Tina, 53, and Mick Hickton, 52, planned to get married later this year but had to cancel following the coronavirus outbreak. Tina is undergoing cancer treatment at Dorset County Hospital and so staff at the hospital asked the resident chaplain Ron Martin for some help. Mr Martin contacted Justin Welby, the Archbishop, who agreed that the ceremony could take place in hospital. Healthcare workers watched the service with glee – and there was even a cake, donated by a local supermarket.Tina said:The whole experience has been so overwhelming. We are so grateful for everyone\u0027s support at the hospital. From the moment we arrived the whole thing was just surreal. We were so taken back by how far they had gone to support us.Staff were clapping and wishing us well as we went into the chapel and they even gave us flowers, champagne and a cake.”On returning to their home in Dorset, the pair were delighted to see their neighbours had decorated their own homes to celebrate.Tine added: “It really was the perfect day. We all sat in our separate gardens and had tea and cake to celebrate. We\u0027ve also asked Ron to come and do a blessing in our garden when the pandemic has passed so we can celebrate our marriage with all our family and friends who couldn\u0027t be here.Congratulations to the happy couple.Here’s what else is happening around the world:Scout volunteers are producing personal protective equipment for NHS staff using 3D printers.

Other countries, impatient to lift their own economic paralysis, are watching closely to see whether the pandemic takes root once more.But not everyone will follow the same trajectory, as millions of people around the world languish under quarantine.Some European nations have signalled a loosening of their restrictions as early as next week. But it is those that acted fastest that will be able to return freedoms earliest.Those that waited longest, allowing the pandemic to gain a foothold, could face months of uncertainty.Wuhan, the source of the Covid-19 outbreak in late 2019, began to ease restrictions and allowed travel outside the city for the first time on Wednesday, 76 days after China enforced a nationwide quarantine.The UK is more than two weeks into its lockdown, imposed on March 23. A similar trajectory to China would indicate measures could begin to be lifted by early June.But the UK, along with other European countries, were slower to act. It created a new epicentre for the virus in Europe, soon to be overtaken by the USA.Early indications hint at lockdowns beginning to flatten the curve in some of the worst-hit countries including Spain and Italy, providing a better framework for when the UK may be able to shake free from quarantine.The number of daily infections peaked in China in mid-February, around 22 days after their lockdown was imposed.It took a further 24 days for the number of new cases to fall below 100 from a peak of over 4,000.Amid fears of a second wave of infections, officials waited another month after cases stabilised before they emerged from quarantine, using the time to ensure new cases were not being imported.Authorities scrutinised travellers arriving at airports, including asymptomatic people who could potentially spread the virus to others despite showing no symptoms.New daily cases dropped below 100 on March 8, and have not risen in a significant way since then.China also enforced lockdowns relatively early. It was only on January 7 the new strain of coronavirus - Covid-19 - was identified.Less than three weeks later Hubei province was under lockdown and the government was busy shutting down neighbouring provinces.In the early days of the outbreak, many other countries employed a \u0027contain\u0027 strategy to keep the virus at bay, and failed to enforce restrictions on travel or social distancing for more than a month.Spain and Belgium did not lock down for 43 days after their first case, while the UK, Germany and France did not impose quarantines for more than 53 days. Italy locked down faster than most in Europe - 39 days after the first case was identified, and new cases peaked 13 days later.In Spain, the peak in new cases came 19 days after quarantine was imposed, and reached higher than Italy, 9,000 to 6,500.As the virus hit both countries hard, it will likely take longer to dissipate.The lockdown was scheduled to be lifted in Italy on April 3, but officials ordered it to be extended as daily deaths still numbered in their hundreds.China waited until fewer than 10 deaths a day were being recorded before lifting their lockdown.Spain plans to use mass testing to escape the shutdown,  widening testing to include people who do not show symptoms. Until now, only those infected or suspected of having the virus have been tested.We are preparing ourselves for de-escalation for which it is important to know who is contaminated to be able to gradually lift Spanish citizens\u0027 lockdown, said Arancha Gonzalez, the foreign minister.The government has extended the lockdown until April 26 but restrictions on some manufacturing and construction sectors could be lifted after Easter.Countries which acted earliest could reap rewards, able to escape lockdown earliest.Denmark has announced primary schools will reopen from April 15, and Austria said small shops and garden centres can open their doors again from April 14. Denmark, Austria and Switzerland all enforced quarantine measures within a month of identifying their first cases.None has seen more than 2,000 cases a day, and all are now seeing signs of reducing the outbreak, averting being overwhelmed by the virus.In Austria, cases peaked at just over 1,000 a day, 12 days after lockdown. In Switzerland daily cases have not reached 1,800 a day, suggesting both countries have the virus under a degree of control for the time being.Austria, where the growth rate in daily infections has dropped from around 40 per cent in mid-March to less than three per cent, on Monday became one of the first countries in Europe to propose a timetable for lifting restrictions.“The fact we were among the first to impose restrictions now gives us the opportunity to get out of this crisis faster,” Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor, told a press conference. “But only if we continue to adhere to the current measures and stand together as well as we have done so far.”Small shops, garden centres and DIY stores will be allowed to reopen from next Tuesday under the provisional timetable outlined by Mr Kurz. Other shops will be allowed to reopen from May 1, and restaurants and hotels from mid-May.Vienna\u0027s public parks are also to reopen next week, after a backlash against their closure.Schools will remain closed until at least mid-May, and a ban on public events will remain in place until June.All scenarios involve waiting until the virus has peaked and the number of deaths has started to fall dramatically before any action will be taken.If our timeline mirrors China, the Government could be in a position to consider lifting restrictions by early summer.Under the first strategy, some social distancing and lockdown measures would continue throughout much of the year, but there would be breaks in which life would get back to normal.For example, social distancing could be alternated on a regional basis to give people a rest from draconian restrictions.According to  analysis of the available data from multiple countries with coronavirus outbreaks, the number of deaths in the UK could peak within a week.Experts say it takes about two weeks to see the impact of a lockdown in any one country, based on the incubation period of coronavirus.Paul Hunter, Professor of Medicine at the University of East Anglia said: Personally, I suspect that the disease will tail off during June and July, partly because of social distancing, partly because of increased population (herd) immunity, and partly because these sorts of infections tend to spread less readily during the summer.So I suspect there will be some relaxation at that time. But I think it may come back, though less aggressively, in the autumn, and social isolation may need to be strengthened for a while.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"no hunting swimming surfing new zealands strict virus measures","story":"New Zealand’s strict social distancing regimen is being held up as a model for keeping the spread of Covid-19 under control, with hunting, swimming and surfing all banned, and case numbers dwindling. As of Wednesday, New Zealand had 969 confirmed cases, 241 “probable cases”, 282 recovered cases, just 12 people in hospital with Covid-19, and one death from the illness.Cases have fallen for three consecutive days, with 54 confirmed or probable cases reported Tuesday, and 50 on Wednesday.While the population of New Zealand is just under five million, three million tourists visit every year, and it could have been a very different story. The New Zealand government publicly released its Covid-19 modelling on March 31, which projected the grim consequences of a lack of early action to curb the spread of the coronavirus, and reinforced the decision to declare a state of emergency and implement a nationwide lockdown.In the worst-case scenario shown in the modelling, more than two-thirds of New Zealand’s population would get sick, 146,000 people would be hospitalised, 36,600 would need to enter an intensive care unit, and 27,600 would die.Professor Michael Baker, a New Zealand epidemiologist, said on 3 April that his country had the “most decisive and strongest lockdown in the world at the moment” and is “a huge standout as the only Western country that\u0027s got an elimination goal” for Covid-19.The lockdown, in place for less than two weeks, extended so far as to ban surfing, swimming in the sea, and hunting in bushland. Schools were closed. Internal flights banned with a handful of exceptions. The borders closed. The public was urged not to do anything that could ert the attention and resources of emergency services. New Zealanders have largely adhered to strict guidelines on walking and cycling only within their own neighbourhoods, queuing more than 1.5m apart, and sticking to one-in, one-out protocols at grocery shops. Strict rules on their own don’t hold a plan together without the adhesive of leadership. Many have praised Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, for her clear messaging. Among her admirers is Alistair Campbell, formerly an adviser to Tony Blair.“Having now watched all the key moments in Prime Minister Ardern\u0027s handling of the crisis, I would say she has scored high marks,” he wrote in the New Zealand Herald. “She gave clarity sadly lacking in the UK about who key workers were, and what essential journeys were… She shared that plan in a way I have never felt the US and UK governments have shared theirs, which has allowed an impression to develop that they are rather making it up as they go along.”The action will come at a cost. In addition to funding a comprehensive assistance package, the New Zealand government is prepared to suffer a significant blow from the loss of tourists.In 2019 tourism employed one in eight New Zealanders, and international tourism generated an NZ$16.2billion contribution to the country’s GDP.Ms Ardern hasn\u0027t sugar-coated her messages. On March 23 she gave the country 48 hours to prepare for the heightened quarantine measures.“We currently have 102 cases,” she said. “But so did Italy once.”It has been made clear distancing measures will remain in place until a vaccine is developed and distributed. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"us navy acting secretary resigns calling ousted aircraft carrier","story":"Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly resigned on Tuesday after he faced mounting backlash for firing and ridiculing the commander of a US aircraft carrier who pleaded for help stemming a coronavirus outbreak onboard.Mr Modly\u0027s resignation highlighted the US military\u0027s struggle to meet increasingly competing priorities: maintaining readiness for conflict and safeguarding servicemembers as the virus spreads globally.The episode deepened upheaval in Navy leadership. The Navy\u0027s last secretary was fired in November over his handling of the case of a Navy SEAL convicted of battlefield misconduct. The Navy SEAL had won the support of President Donald Trump.US Defense Secretary Mark Esper announced Mr Modly\u0027s resignation on Twitter, saying the Navy\u0027s top civilian had resigned of his own accord. Trump concurred, saying it was a selfless act and adding he had nothing to do with it.The whole thing was … very unfortunate, Mr Trump said at the White House.Mr Modly\u0027s resignation occurred only after mounting pressure from Congress and a backlash from the crew, and followed Trump\u0027s own suggestion on Monday that he might get involved in the crisis - saying the Navy captain whom Modly fired was also a good man.I briefed President Trump after my conversation with Secretary Modly, Mr Esper said, as he named an Army Undersecretary Jim McPherson to replace Modly as acting Navy secretary.In a note to sailors, Mr Modly said he took responsibility for events over the past few days.It is not just missiles that can take us down, words can do it too, if we aren\u0027t careful with how and when we use them, Modly said.It’s my fault. I own it.Captain Brett Crozier, whom Mr Modly relieved of command last week, favoured more dramatic steps to safeguard his sailors aboard the Theodore Roosevelt in a four-page letter that leaked to the public last week.When Mr Modly fired him over the leak, his crew hailed Capt Crozier as a hero and gave him a rousing sendoff captured on video, apparently upsetting Mr Modly and leading the Navy\u0027s top civilian to fly to Guam to castigate the captain in a speech to the crew on Monday.Mr Modly questioned Capt Crozier\u0027s character, saying at one point he was either stupid or naive. After audio of his speech leaked, including expletives, Mr Modly initially stood by his remarks. But later, at Mr Esper\u0027s request, he issued an apology.Mr Trump appeared to take Mr Modly\u0027s side, saying Capt Crozier had erred with the letter.The captain should not have written a letter. He didn’t have to be Ernest Hemingway. He made a mistake, but he had a bad day, Mr Trump told a news briefing.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/05/05/16/bocelli.jpg","title":"bocelli concert stream watch live easter sunday duomo cathedral milan","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘It will be a joy to witness it, in the Duomo, during the Easter celebration which evokes the mystery of birth and rebirth,’ Italian tenor saysItalian tenor Andrea Bocelli will perform a solo concert at Milan’s historic Duomo cathedral this Easter Sunday.The concert will not be attended by an audience and access to the public is prohibited due to coronavirus\u0026nbsprestrictions in place by the Italian government.However, fans around the world will be able to watch the concert streamed live from Bocelli’s official YouTube channel from 6pm UK time, 10am PST and 1pm EST.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBocelli will be accompanied during the pro-bono concert only by the cathedral’s organist, Emanuele Vianelli, who will play one of the\u0026nbspworld’s largest pipe organs.Among the pieces performed will be “Ave Maria” and Mascagni’s “Sancta Maria”.

Ben Chapman finds out whyOn the open plains of Wyoming, in the shadow of the Rocky Mountains, something strange has been happening. Last month, coronavirus itself had barely touched this sparsely populated American state. But the impact of Covid-19 could already be seen.As thousands of aircraft were grounded and billions of citizens ordered to stay home, global demand for oil, the key lubricant of world commerce, had crashed so far and so fast that producers in Wyoming were willing to pay someone 19 cents a barrel to take it off their hands. It was worse than worthless, it had become a burden.A thousand miles northwest, in Alberta, Canada, home to perhaps the world’s single largest deposit of hydrocarbons, a similar story was playing out.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLast week, if you so desired, you could have purchased one of Canada’s estimated 1.7 trillion barrels of oil, for just $5. In other words, 158 litres of the world’s most vital commodity\u0026nbsp would set you back less than a pint of beer.Black Monday: Why cheap oil sent world’s stock markets into a tailspinThis is not mere trivia from obscure corners of the global oil market. It could have lasting impacts on what will soon return to being the most important battle facing humanity – the climate crisis.US and Canadian oil production looks set to be decimated by the catastrophic slump in oil demand and some experts think it will have a hard time bouncing back. Thousands of jobs will go and many oil wells will cease production. This in turn, the argument goes, will aid the shift towards a lower carbon world.There are other aspects to the crisis\u0026nbspthat could be good for the climate potential changes in our behaviour could stick with us, meaning people work from home more often, travel less and shop locally, for example. Companies that currently fly supplies from all around the world or rely on migrant labour may conclude that building things closer to home is less risky.While these may sound like the rosy predictions of green campaigners seeking a silver lining, they are in fact those of Jeff Currie, global head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs. The Wall Street investment bank is not known for environmental utopianism, its analysis is hewn from mountains of data and cold, hard facts.Currie and his team believe that plummeting demand caused by the current crisis could, paradoxically, lead to a massive spike in oil prices next year when the economy comes out of hibernation. They predict that the oil industry won’t be able to keep up, leaving a gap for renewables such as wind and solar to fill.In an eye-catching report, Currie said coronavirus would “permanently alter the energy industry and its geopolitics, restrict demand as economic activity normalises and shift the debate around climate change”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailA key reason for this is that the energy source to which the industrialised world has been addicted for more than a century has some major physical constraints. It can’t simply be turned off and on like a tap, Currie tells The Independent.It’s going to require a lot of money to be spent to fix the industry“Oil wells are very different from other industrial processes. They’re organic deposits that require pressure to extract them. When you shut them down you typically do damage to the well,” says Currie.No one has ever attempted to turn off the oil supply so quickly as in the last couple of weeks. Global demand has cratered by as much as 30 per cent, or 30 million barrels a day, far in excess of anything seen in any previous downturn. Meanwhile, Russia and Saudi Arabia have kept production levels high as they engage in a battle for market share.“Because oil, and energy more broadly, must be contained within infrastructure like pipelines tankers and refineries, you can’t run a surplus indefinitely,“ says Currie. “You can’t just pour the oil outside of the well, it has to go into the system.”Key parts of that system are already full, so many producers, particularly those based inland that are reliant on pipelines rather than ships to transport their oil, will have no choice but to shut down, or “shut in”, in industry parlance.Why has the oil price crashed by 30 per cent?Zero-hours contract workers ‘sacked by text’ during Covid-19 outbreakThe world will recover from Covid-19 – it may not from climate changeHedge funds continue to short sell UK companies despite calls to stopHedge fund billionaire vows to punish companies over climate changeShutting in and then opening up again can be prohibitively expensive, which is why producers in Alberta, Wyoming and beyond are willing to sell oil at a loss rather than halt production altogether.Oil is often described as being found in “reservoirs” or “pools”, giving the misleading impression that it sits in cavernous holes underground which simply have to be located and tapped. It’s easy to imagine sticking something akin to a huge straw in the ground and sucking out the oil.In truth oil deposits are often found saturated in tiny holes of porous rocks. Pressure must be applied constantly\u0026nbspto force the oil out of the well. This is easy at the start when pressure can be naturally high, resulting in the kind of gusher often depicted by Hollywood.But, as a well matures, it becomes increasingly tricky – and therefore expensive – to apply the required pressure and extract oil. Starting up the process again, or drilling new wells, adds further cost.The wells most vulnerable to being shut down and never opening up again are those in North America and Russia, says Currie: “It’s going to require a lot of money to be spent to fix the industry.”That money is no longer forthcoming in the quantities that many oil companies have grown used to, meaning only the largest and most efficient companies are likely to survive.If the world is addicted to oil, the oil industry itself is addicted to cash, requiring huge injections of capital to fund exploration and production. But appetite for investing in fossil fuels, particularly in uncertain times, is drying up. With tens of billions of dollars likely to be wiped out as the majority of small, heavily indebted, US oil producers go to the wall, that appetite is likely to reduce even further.Capital markets are more cagey about handing money to oil producers after years of below-par returns. Meanwhile, banks are beginning to cut back financing for oil and gas, and large funds, including Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, have reduced their investment in the sector. The Bank of England is also looking into climate stress testing that could force lenders to get rid of assets at risk as the world shifts to net zero carbon.At the same time, renewables are rapidly becoming a more attractive investment. A wind farm requires a lot less capital than an oil field, and while the returns are less spectacular they are more solid and reliable.Paul Flood, portfolio manager at Newton Investment Management, says companies that produce renewable energy are unique in that they remain stable even through turbulent economic times. That makes them an ideal place for governments to focus what will likely be huge stimulus programmes in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis. “It fits very nicely. You’re killing two birds with one stone by providing new sources of renewable energy to decarbonise power, and also providing pension funds with stable revenues.“I think if governments are going to do fiscal spending they’re going to have more credibility directing it towards renewables and climate change initiatives than towards oil and gas.”Despite this apparently gloomy outlook for fossil fuels, not everyone is convinced Covid-19 will be a good thing for the climate. Legal \u0026amp General Investment Management\u0026nbspinvests more than £1 trillion of other people’s money, mostly for the very long term.Nick Stansbury, LGIM’s head of commodity research, believes the current slump in oil prices must be seen on balance as bad for the environment. “From a climate perspective, this is really disappointing,“ he says, “it’s not what we wanted to happen. We did not want oil prices to crash, just as we were beginning to see real momentum behind clean technology and its competitiveness. This has set that back in a very disappointing way.”As consumers, we react pretty quickly to cheaper oil. LGIM’s research shows that after the last significant oil price fall back in 2014-15, Americans started buying less efficient cars within a month. Those decisions have implications for emissions for many years until people trade in their SUVs again.However, Stansbury says American drivers have already gone pretty much “all-in” on gas guzzlers, so the current low prices may not cause them to trade up and get even more inefficient vehicles.There is a broader and more important point to all this: if oil stays around $30 a barrel – the current cost of Brent Crude – that clearly underestimates the actual environmental cost of combusting fossil fuels, says Stansbury. He doesn’t see the kind of drastic shortfall in oil supplies that Jeff Currie at Goldman is predicting.“There is a higher probability of oil shortages in the next decade as a consequence of this but I think it’s far from certain that that’s what we will get.” US onshore producers already know about huge reserves of oil, it’s just a case of having access to capital so they can go and drill it.What about those much-heralded changes to our behaviour after the pandemic? Martijn Rats, oil strategist at giant US bank\u0026nbspMorgan Stanley, also foresees a long-term shift away from fossil fuels.He highlights three driving forces of this change. First, the current low oil price gives governments a chance to unwind $300bn of subsidies handed out to the fossil fuel industry each year. Second, economic stimulus programmes required to resuscitate activity after the crisis will likely be used to boost investment in clean energy. And, third, we may work from home more and take less flights.“This does not bode well for oil demand in the long term, especially relative to previous long-term expectations,” Rats wrote in a recent note to clients.A report this week by the AA predicts Covid-19 will cause a permanent reduction in travel in the UK because we’ve quickly adapted to use remote working technology and realised it’s quite effective. The AA even said that a planned £27bn investment in Britain’s roads might not be needed, and perhaps some of the money might be better aimed at improving our broadband internet speeds.Reports of the death of commuting may be greatly exaggerated however, at least for the time being. Nick Stansbury at LGIM thinks it’s too early to tell whether there will be a behavioural shift significant enough to have a real impact on emissions.“Will a lot of us end up working from home a bit more often, gaining a few more hours in our days? We probably will.”But that’s about as much as we can say. Any emissions prevented by fewer journeys to work are likely to be swamped by surging demand for air travel in emerging markets, he says.Jeff Currie at Goldman Sachs believes that higher oil prices after the crisis will hold back demand for flights and make people commute less often.However, given that the world has experienced only a few weeks of coronavirus lockdown conditions, he is sceptical about predictions that the experience will drive long-term changes to our behaviour.“Wait and see,” he says. “We have no idea.”Oil and Gas\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

You go after Trump \u0026amp Kavanaugh saying Believe Victims, you are a lie. You have always been a lie. The corrupt DNC is in on the smear job of Tara Reade, so are you. SHAME.”In response, Milano wrote: “I continue to support you and applaud your bravery as well as acknowledge all the people you have helped along the way, @Rosemcgowan. Be well and stay safe.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAlexandra Tara Reade, a former Biden staffer, accused the presidential hopeful of sexually assaulting her when she worked in his Senate office in 1993.The Biden campaign has denied the allegation, writing in a statement: “Women have a right to tell their story, and reporters have an obligation to rigorously vet those claims. We encourage them to do so, because these accusations are false.”What Jake Gyllenhaal’s Bubble Boy can teach us about self-isolationMilano has been criticised for still endorsing Biden despite the allegation. Milano has previously supported women who have come forward with sexual assault allegations about Republicans Donald Trump and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.While appearing on Andy Cohen’s US radio show, Milano defended her continued endorsement of Biden, explaining: “I believe that even though we should believe women, and that is an important thing, and what that statement really means is that for so long the go-to has been to not to believe them.”She continued: “So, really we have to societally change that mindset to believing women, but that does not mean at the expense of not giving men their due process and investigating situations. It’s got to be fair in both directions.”“I just don’t feel comfortable throwing away a decent man that I’ve known for 15 years in this time of complete chaos without there being a thorough investigation and I’m sure that the mainstream media would be jumping all over this... if they found more evidence through their investigation. So I’m just sort of staying quiet about it,” Milano explained.McGowan, who portrayed one of three magical sisters alongside Milano on the fantasy series Charmed, said in 2018 that she did not endorse Milano or her political activism.“I don’t like her,” told ABC News. “’Cause I think she’s a lie.

Here’s how to take the perfect picture of it:Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUse a landmark to get perspectiveEveryone will be taking pictures of the supermoon by itself, but some of the best pictures show the moon next to a land mark or trees and houses, which is what helps to give the picture “a sense of place”, says Nasa’s senior photographer, Bill Ingalls. “Think of how to be creative – that means tying it into some land-based object. It can be a local landmark or anything to give your photo a sense of place.”Created with Sketch.9 best images of the 2016 supermoon Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016Pick the best spotLocation isn’t everything, but it can definitely help with getting a perfect picture of the supermoon if you have time to plan it. You can look up the best monuments or statues in your area to photograph the image of the moon against, like Mr Ingalls does in Washington D.C., where he lives. “It means doing a lot of homework. I use Google Maps and other apps – even a compass – to plan where to get just the right angle at the right time,” he told Nasa.Use an app to find the moonUnless you\u0027re an astronomer, the best way to know where the moon will rise or set is to use a app on your smartphone to locate it. There are several free or cheap options you can choose from, each using your phone\u0027s inbuilt accelerometer to know which way you\u0027re facing.The apps can also tell you what phase the moon is in, while some even give other celestial details, like the location of planets and star constellations. Decent options for iOS and Android devices include Star Chart, Sky Safari and Skyview.Get the right exposureIf you’re taking a picture on your camera, control the light balance by first tapping the screen where the moon appears to get the camera to focus on the object before dragging your finger up and down to play with the exposure. “You’ll usually want to drag it down for underexposure to be sure you have all the highlight detail,” National Geographic photographer Michael Christopher Brown said.Use a tripod for your camera or rest your phone on a solid surfaceDavid Reneke, an astronomer and writer for Australian science magazine told ABC.net that if you’re using an SLR or DSLR then it’s important to play with aperture settings on your camera to photograph the supermoon, but that using a tripod is essential.It’s worth using a tripod for taking pictures with a smartphone too, as any camera shake can compromise the quality of the pictures – but if you don’t have one to hand you can simply rest your phone on a window ledge.For older smartphones that use a digital zoom rather than an optical zoom, it’s generally best not to use the zoom as it could compromise the quality of the image. Instead, take the picture and then crop it.Newer phones like the Huawei P30 and P40 series feature incredible zoom capabilities that can take detailed pictures of far away objects. Other cameras come with special features to improve pictures of the night sky, such as the Google Pixel 4’s Astro mode.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is vital that everyone adhere\u0026nbspto these requirements.“Police officers and staff are putting themselves in harm’s way day and night to explain these instructions to our communities, encourage co-operation and, where necessary, enforce them.”In a joint statement, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie and Wendy Chamberlain, the MSP and MP respectively for the area where Dr Calderwood has her second home, said: “It is difficult to see how the chief medical officer will be able to carry the important messages about the virus and the lockdown if she has not even followed it herself.”They added: “If we are going to get through this pandemic we need medical leaders who everyone can follow. It is with great regret that we say that the chief medical officer will need to go.”Scotland’s constitution secretary Mike Russell said there was no doubt Dr Calderwood’s visit was “ill-advised”. The\u0026nbspScottish Government confirmed it was an overnight stay to “check on a family home”.Mr Russell said she would be “answerable” for her decision when she appears at the daily coronavirus briefing with Nicola Sturgeon later today.He added: “I’m saying to everybody... do not go out except in the very exceptional circumstances that are listed, think about these things and remember by breaking them you are risking lives.”Scottish Police Federation general secretary Calum Steele said policing the pandemic had been made more difficult and stressed checking on a second home is not one of the “reasonable excuses” providing an exception to emergency coronavirus legislation.He tweeted: “In defending the indefensible has the Scottish Government not just thrown the CMO under the bus? Checking on a 2nd home is not one of the prescribed reasonable excuses.”Monica Lennon,\u0026nbspMSP for central Scotland, said in a statement on Facebook: “As the chief medical officer for Scotland, Catherine Calderwood beams that message into our homes on behalf of the government every single day, however, she has failed to practice what she preaches. Not only is this hypocritical, it is irresponsible and the first minister cannot accept this conduct.“Hundreds of Scots have died and there is no sign of the spread of the virus slowing. The CMO has undermined Scotland’s pandemic response and if she doesn’t offer her resignation the first minister should sack her.”Reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But we’re committed to working with others groups and organisations who come might along to help meet the needs of the community in different ways as time goes on.”He said the group has a pool of over 250 volunteers and an on call rota who are now getting several dozen calls a day from people in the area in “real need” of supplies.“Whatever help\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspcan give in mapping the support network across the country is a good thing, especially if it means more people get access to the support they need,” Mr Vine added.Many food aid charities have been struggling with a drop in donations and a fall in the number of regular volunteers.

There are a lot of people are struggling to make rent, struggling with loss of income, struggling to access universal credit, as well as isolating for health reasons. It’s such a wide range of things.”Sam Maher, 44, is working with a mutual aid group of volunteers in Machynlleth, covering the small town in west Wales and its surrounding villages.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastThe group began by putting postcards through people’s doors to try to make sure everyone knows help is available for food shopping and picking up of medicines, and at the end of March they also set up a phone line people in urgent need can call.“It’s really just about caring for your community,” she said. “At the moment I think the vast majority of the need out there is being dealt with by neighbour looking after neighbour, which is essential if local authorities and charities are overstretched.“We’re working to create partnerships with other community groups, voluntary bodies and the council to make sure no\u0026nbspone is slipping through the cracks. It’s terrible to think there are people out there that we’re missing. I do worry the safety net isn’t strong enough.”National co-ordinators at Covid-19 Mutual Aid UK estimate there were 1,000 groups\u0026nbspset up in the week after the government announced vulnerable people would have to be shielded from the virus.

Yet members of the public still able to help are signing up to serve a worthy cause.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMarina Nenadic, 30, is one of a several new recruits at\u0026nbspCity Harvest\u0026nbspin Acton, west London, after the food surplus charity called for more hands to sort through the produce rescued from restaurants, manufacturers and supermarket packing houses.“I’m working from home four days a week, so I had some extra time, and I really wanted to do something useful with it,” she explained. “It’s within walking distance of where I live, so I’m not taking any extra risks with journeys.”How to support our campaignMs\u0026nbspNenadic\u0026nbspis a marketing executive for\u0026nbspKew\u0026nbspGardens, but she now spends at least one day a week creating crates of food packages for the 300 smaller groups – including\u0026nbspfood banks, low-income family projects and homeless shelters – served by City Harvest.“It’s a really positive atmosphere, despite the fact it’s such difficult times. It’s actually quite exciting to see so much food come in, knowing it’s going out to people who need it. It’s been such a rewarding thing to do.”In the first two weeks of the coronavirus lockdown, City Harvest has rescued and redistributed over 130 tons of surplus food. Responding to the enormous scale of the crisis, the group has joined forces with even larger food surplus charities in the capital – our campaign partner The Felix Project and Fareshare – to create the\u0026nbspLondon Food Alliance.In a bid to make sure\u0026nbspfood gets out to those who need it\u0026nbspas efficiently as possible, the London Food Alliance is now co-ordinating with all 32 London boroughs to make sure the new, council-run community hubs are well-stocked with supplies.Liz Taylor, 61, signed up for volunteering work at The Felix Project last week, and is now packing and delivering food at\u0026nbspthe charity’s main Park\u0026nbspRoyale\u0026nbspwarehouse.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s actually a bit of relief to get outside and do something. It’s obviously worthwhile, but it’s good for my wellbeing too.”Mohamed Elmi, 34, volunteering with City Harvest for the past 18 months, says\u0026nbspsome of the Acton-based charity’s few dozen or so new volunteers have recently lost jobs in the hospitality industry.“It’s been a difficult time for them but this gives them a sense of purpose,”\u0026nbspsays Mr Elmi, who also works full-time for a homeless healthcare charity. “It’s really helped us fill in for some of the volunteers who are having to stay at home. Yes, we’re putting ourselves at risk – but this work is really needed right now.”London mayor Sadiq Khan told The Independent: “The altruism of the British people in recent days has been a beacon of hope amid the darkness of the coronavirus.”He added: “You can donate spare food at a series of hubs being set up across the city.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers.

Finally he throws in tomatoes, turmeric, ginger and cumin.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He said: “If you’re in a fortunate position, I ask you to volunteer to help those less fortunate. Together, we will get through this.”Donations yesterday included £10,000 from The Lehman Brothers Foundation Europe.The chairman, Peter Sherratt, said: “We are starting to scale up our assistance to vulnerable children and are thrilled to support the Food For London Now appeal and The Felix Project.”If you are in need of food, please go to your borough’s website to get on their list and food will be delivered to your doorstep.Help The Hungry is also trying to highlight groups in need as they try to feed the vulnerable across the country, whether they need food, volunteers or cash donations.To donate to the campaign, visit virginmoneygivingHelp the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The £1m you have donated will help us help The Felix Project feed NHS workers, care workers, the poor and the vulnerable. Thank you.How to support our campaign“But I have to report that I have been out delivering food with Felix today and they are seeing unprecedented demand from people who cannot afford or access food.“I went to two homeless charities, The Marylebone Project and Rhythms of Life, where our deliveries are preventing deep distress. I accompanied one of 22 Felix vans that set off across the capital, filled to the brim, to ferry over 20 tonnes of nutritious food to three of the giant community hubs established in Barnet, Islington and Haringey, and to more than 75 charities and schools.“That’s more than double the 10 tonnes a day Felix were supplying in normal times.”Mr Lebedev added: “Within days, this picture is set to change dramatically yet again. Felix say\u0026nbspthey expect another 11 community hubs in another 11 boroughs to open their doors to hungry Londoners – and with it, Felix’s output will need to double again.“That is why we at The Independent\u0026nbspare committing our resources to raise another million pounds to prevent food insecurity to people already anxious about their health and that of loved ones. That is why we say: £1m raised, £1m to go. Let’s finish the job and keep vulnerable Londoners healthy and fed.”The deliveries are part of our food appeal’s support for the charities in the London Homeless Collective, the umbrella organisation of London homeless charities that The Independent\u0026nbspis working with through our Homeless Fund. Felix is delivering to other homeless organisations, as well as The Marylebone Project, including Centrepoint.Des Scott, CEO of the Church Army, which runs The Marylebone Project and provides 112 beds to homeless women under the Edgware flyover, said: “Being able to get fresh vegetables is one of the key things we can do to keep these women healthy.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it added: “This has now stabilised across the group and more normal sales volumes are being experienced.”The supermarket chain said it had seen “significant absence” of staff as Covid-19 spreads around the UK and had recruited 45,000 additional employees in the last fortnight.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We’re still am afraid on a daily basis seeing too many people losing their lives. At the moment thankfully we’ve got some spare capacity in intensive care units in London but we can’t be complacent at all.Mr Khan also warned against possible restrictions to exercise being imposed by the government, as many people across the country “live in overcrowded accommodation often with young people” and needed exercise to keep physically and mentally healthy.“It’s really important though that people don’t sunbathe, have barbecues in the park or play team sports,” he said. “The reason to have exercise is to make sure stay reasonably fit - to avoid having so-called cabin fever. Even though it is going to be good weather this weekend and it is a long Easter weekend.”However, Mr Khan claimed there was a “small minority” of people last weekend who “weren’t behaving as if we were facing a global pandemic” when the country had already lost over 6,000 lives to the disease.He said: “My message to that small minority is please understand your behaviour has an impact on others because it means the virus spread which means more pressure on the NHS and it means more people dying.”His remarks come after the health minister Edward Argar said the government will review the current lockdown across the country “when the scientific advice is such that we appear to gone over the peak and when it is safe to do so”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers are almost certain that at least at its beginning, the universe was expanding uniformly.But that assumption might\u0026nbspbe wrong, at least in the universe of today, according to a new study using data from Nasa and European Space Agency observatories. Researchers using that information found that the different parts of the universe are actually expanding at different rates, with clusters of galaxies in different parts of the sky behaving differently.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOur usual understanding of the universe suggests that after the Big Bang, the universe began to expand in all directions, with galaxies and galaxy clusters moving apart at the same rate across the cosmos. The new study suggests that might not be the case, with that rate actually varying depending on where we look.Based on our cluster observations we may have found differences in how fast the universe is expanding depending on which way we looked, said co-author Gerrit Schellenberger\u0026nbspfrom the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. This would contradict one of the most basic underlying assumptions we use in cosmology today.Scientists find they don’t know how fast the universe is expandingResearchers have long attempted to find a definitive answer to whether the universe is in fact the same in all directions. They have attempted to measure it using a variety of different methods, including looking at galaxies through infrared and watching exploded stars, but nothing has proven decisive and the results have given indications both ways.To find their measurements in the new study, researchers used a new technique to try and measure the expansion of the universe. They looked at more than 800 galaxy clusters using the new technique, in an attempt to understand at precisely what rate it they are expanding at.Firstly, they worked out the amount of X-rays a given galaxy cluster would be emitting, in a way that gives a constant answer independent of changes such as the expansion speed of universe. Taht relied on the relationship between the temperature of the hot gas in a galaxy cluster and the amount of X-rays, or its X-ray luminosity.Secondly, they worked out X-ray luminosity using a different method that did in fact rely on the universe\u0027s expansion speed. Those numbers showed that the expansion speed was not actually uniform, and that the universe is moving away from us at different speeds in different parts.It is not the first time that researchers have found evidence of the uneven expansion of the universe, but may be the one that shows it more convincingly than any other.This is a hugely fascinating result, said Norbert Schartel, a project scientist on ESA\u0027s XMM-Newton observatory, which helped contribute towards the discovery. Previous studies have suggested that the present Universe might not be expanding evenly in all directions, but this result – the first time such a test has been performed with galaxy clusters in X-rays –\u0026nbsphas a much greater significance, and also reveals a great potential for future investigations.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

But this may be unlikely given that scientists expect the universe\u0027s expansion to be the main deciding factor of that speed.If that is not the case, the research suggests that the universe is not actually isotropic, and that it is different in different directions.\u0026nbspDark energy, for instance, could be distributed differently throughout the universe and could be causing unusual results.Researchers have described the expansion of the universe being like a loaf of raisin bread that has been placed in the oven: as it cooks, it expands, and the raisins that represents the galaxies move away from each other. If the bread is evenly mixed, the expansion would be uniform, but the latest results suggest that there may be an overlooked ingredient in the dough.This would be like if the yeast in the bread isn\u0027t evenly mixed, causing it to expand faster in some places than in others, said co-author Thomas Reiprich, also of the University of Bonn. It would be remarkable if dark energy were found to have different strengths in different parts of the universe. However, much more evidence would be needed to rule out other explanations and make a convincing case.The study is published in the latest issue of the journal\u0026nbspAstronomy and Astrophysics and can be read online.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Please remain inside and we\u0027ll have more supports in the days to come.”Similar advice about the wearing of non-medical face masks\u0026nbsphas been given to the public in a number of countries, with the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention making the same recommendation.Reiterating the importance of hand washing and social distancing, Dr Tam said their use was an “added layer of prevention” to protect those around you from exposure to the coronavirus, should you be infected, but asymptomatic.Health Minister Patty\u0026nbspHajdu\u0026nbspadded her support to the wearing of non-medical cloth masks, saying: “If there was not a way for me to practice social distancing, I wouldn\u0027t hesitate to wear that.”In her own coronavirus case update, Dr Tam confirmed that Canada now has 17,063 cases and 345 deaths.

William Yang, Betsy Joles and Adam Withnall reportOn Wednesday, for the first time in more than two months, 11 million people in China’s Wuhan will have the option to step out of their homes and leave the city.The lifting of the lockdown in the place where the global coronavirus pandemic started is a symbolic victory for the Chinese government, coming as new infections and daily death tolls still soar in Europe and the US.Residents in Wuhan, who have been subjected to one of the world’s strictest lockdowns, will not see life return to normal immediately. The Chinese government says travel should be for “necessary” reasons only, and screening will still take place upon arrival in other provinces whether by road, rail or air.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut the dismantling of roadblocks from midnight, and the opening up of non-essential businesses, buses and metro services on Wednesday, will be watched closely by virus-hit countries around the world trying to get a sense of what their own exit strategies from coronavirus lockdowns might look like.Wuhan has accounted for 61 per cent of China’s 81,700 reported coronavirus cases, and the trauma of what residents now refer to as the “great calamity” will leave a legacy lasting long after the return to freedom of movement.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastFor Graham*, who along with his parents became infected not long after the city’s outbreak began, the experience has left him determined not just to get out of Hubei province, but to leave China altogether.A photographer\u0026nbspwho was used to roaming around the city with his camera, Graham\u0026nbspfelt his loss of liberty during the lockdown more keenly than most.His parents became ill first, and after the disease spread to the rest of the family they spent seven days at the People’s Hospital in Wuhan, before finally being transferred to one of the city’s many Square Cabin\u0026nbsphospitals.These makeshift hospitals were specifically built, at breakneck speed, to house coronavirus patients with mild symptoms. Graham\u0026nbspdescribes how the facilities, staffed mostly by doctors trained in traditional Chinese medicine, encouraged treatments that “didn’t make any sense”, he tells The Independent.Wuhan lockdown liftedPatients were told to massage the area around their belly button clockwise throughout the day, as the doctor claimed this would help them “release the virus” out of their bodies.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“When I asked one of the doctors what would happen if I massage my belly button counter-clockwise, he immediately said that’s the typical reasoning in western medicine,” says Graham.Graham says doctors also taught patients how to “detox” by hitting their elbows and other body parts as hard as they could, for prolonged periods, “to cleanse the virus from their lungs. So throughout the day I could hear the sound of patients hitting their elbows, and many of them had bruised elbows.”During his stay in the facility he also witnessed firsthand the ruthlessly utilitarian approach the Chinese authorities took to disease prevention, “trampling” over iniduals’ rights in the process.“Some families were forcefully separated in front of me because they had been assigned to different hospitals based on the severity of their infection,” he recalls.“A guy was begging the authorities at our hospital to let him go see his mother before she passed away. Instead, they handcuffed him to his bed so he couldn’t escape.” The man’s mother later died in a nearby hospital.You have no choice. If you don’t follow orders the police will come and snatch you and put you away“This pandemic made me realise how extreme the Chinese government can be when they try to take control over the society,” Graham\u0026nbspsays. Censorship, always a part of everyday life under the Communist Party, has become even more extreme. “Over the last two months, what we can basically do is to praise the government’s efforts in containing the virus and receive relevant information that has already been heavily censored,” he says.The lockdown, Graham\u0026nbspsays, “helped me understand that as long as I stay in China, I can never enjoy real freedom, and I don’t want my children to have the same life. I think the sensible decision is to leave China, and that’s what I plan to do once the lockdown is over”.Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at SOAS University in London, says China’s authoritarian one-party system means it can enforce a lockdown in a way that would not be possible in most democratic nations. “You have no choice,” he says. “If you don’t follow orders the police will come and snatch you and put you away.He says that one thing that China appears to have done particularly effectively to curtail its outbreak has been the use of a large number of requisitioned locations to quarantine people who have tested positive or travelled abroad away from other members of their community or family.“That probably significantly reduced the level of transmissions within households, and that is something that I don’t think has been widely copied outside of China,” he said. “It would be very hard to imagine that being mandatory in the United Kingdom, that if you test positive with Covid-19 but do not require hospital treatment, you will be required to go into a quarantined quarters separate from your family for two weeks. It’s very difficult to see that being widely embraced or enforceable in the UK.”With the steady reduction in locally transmitted cases culminating in not a single new coronavirus death being reported on Tuesday for the first time since January, attention has turned in China to preventing new cases being brought in from abroad.In Beijing, that has meant ever\u0026nbspstricter conditions for anyone arriving in the county or the capital’s province, even as restrictions in places like Wuhan have eased.James Ashcroft, a Chinese language student at Beijing Normal University, returned to the city from London shortly before all entry for foreigners was halted late last month.At the airport, authorities said he would simply have to stay at home, but a week into his quarantine community volunteers installed a motion sensor on his door.The motion sensor, connected to a program on the messaging application WeChat, would send an alert to the neighbourhood association whenever the door was ajar. If he or his housemate opened the door to pick up a food delivery or put the bins out, they would within minutes get a phone call from the police.Ashcroft says he has seen no written policy that explains why the device was put on his door. “It was only communicated verbally to us that this is a thing that they are trying to apply.”He says he felt much more uncomfortable being monitored in this way than if he had just been asked to observe a quarantine normally. “It doesn’t really contribute to a sense of peace and well-being and surety, to just not quite know what’s happening or why.China ‘squandering opportunity’ by exporting faulty coronavirus testsCarl Rappa, 30, came back to the city from the US before the travel regulations came into effect and says he feels comparatively better off in Beijing as the virus has taken hold elsewhere.Now that international travel has been stopped, Beijing’s efforts to prevent a second wave of imported cases must focus on returning Chinese nationals.But quarantine measures enforced by community groups and local officials appear to be changing rapidly, leaving people to smooth out any kinks as they go. Even as the Chinese government attempts to restore calm, the inconsistencies have added to the sense of unease.“I just feel like they have many loopholes they need to fix,” He Mao, 24, said after completing his hotel quarantine period last week following his return to Beijing from Cambodia.He says he flew through Guangzhou on his way to the capital, and airport officials seemed not to know whether, given the internal layover, he needed to undergo quarantine at a centralised facility. He was eventually allowed to return home to his apartment, only for community volunteers to turn up hours later and move him to a quarantine hotel.Two-thirds of people wish to ‘achieve’ something during coronavirus loUS surgeon general ‘optimistic’ that social distancing is workingNew York cathedral to become a field hospital amid Covid-19For two weeks mandatory stay at the hotel, He was required to pay 6,000 Chinese yuan (£690). While not thrilled about the cost, he’s made peace with his circumstances but said he wishes he would have been informed about what to expect before he arrived.Part of a first wave of arrivals to the city after the regulation about hotel quarantine went into effect, He said he’s also become a test case for friends in a similar position who are stuck outside the country and considering returning. “Everyone is like, ‘you have to share your story because we are all counting on you. Because we are not sure if we should come back’,” he said.Back in Wuhan, not everyone is as excited about the end of the lockdown as might be expected, in part because of a widespread perception that it could be premature.Graham says he hears reports of new cases still emerging from hospitals and some neighbourhoods, that don’t make the official daily tallies. “The government wants to get people back to work, so they lied about the current situation in Wuhan,” he claims. “The official numbers are definitely fake, and it’s just the matter of how fabricated it is.”Tsang, the China Institute director, says Xi Jinping has created a culture in the Communist Party where “whatever he says is the truth, the whole truth, and nobody would ever dare contradict him”. “Xi said he wanted to reduce the numbers to zero. So if you are a senior official in Wuhan, you think that if you report new cases then you are failing the general secretary.”Aware of this dilemma, the Chinese premier Li Keqiang pleaded with local officials on 23 March that “there must be no concealing or underreporting” of cases. “If the premier of China cannot believe in the official figures, I don’t see why I should believe in the official figures,” Tsang says.Ultimately, Tsang says the propaganda coup of opening up Wuhan “at a time when the lockdown is at its tightest in places like New York” would have been too valuable for the Chinese government to let even a small number of cases derail it.A guy was begging the authorities at our hospital to let him go see his mother before she passed away. Instead, they handcuffed him to his bed so he couldn’t ‘escape’Even for those who have stayed healthy in Wuhan, the lockdown has had a transformative impact on lives – and not only in ways that have been negative. For some modern Chinese families, life under lockdown offered a rare opportunity to rebuild fraying bonds.Robin* says he was living with friends in an apartment in the city before the outbreak, as the relationship with his parents had soured since he came out as gay several years ago.“With my father being in his seventies, I decided to go home and spend time with them after the government announced the plan to lock down the city,” he says.As life came to a standstill, Robin had to come to terms with life confined to a 75 square metre apartment with his parents. They played cards, watched television or just tried to catch up on things they had missed in the years since they drifted apart.“It was definitely not easy,” Robin tells The Independent. “I had to rediscover the best way to live with them, as we barely had chances like this before the pandemic happened. Instead of arguing with them as I normally would do, I tried to communicate with them. That suddenly helped clear up all the misunderstanding between me and my father.”This rare chance gave Robin new thoughts about life after the lockdown. “I probably won’t have more opportunities like this in the future, so I don’t think I’m in a rush to move back to my apartment after the lockdown is over,” Robin says. “I want to have more time with my parents.”* Names changed to protect identity.

British manufacturers are retooling production lines to turn out protective kit for doctors, nurses and other staff, giving their all on the front line.Commercial rivalries are being put aside as firms co-operate to develop new ventilators and other vital supplies.Labs are expanding their testing capacity, so NHS staff knowthey can safely get back to work.The public are backing our staff at this time of enormous pressure.I know how much it means to the nurses, doctors, therapists, cleaners, pharmacists, paramedics and countless others giving their all to fight coronavirus that the whole nation is behind them in this battle.The support of Sun readers will help sustain them in the days and weeks ahead.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here thesun whocareswinsappealSo on behalf of the NHS, a thank you too to The Sun, for throwing its weight behind the Clap for Carers campaign to give NHS heroes the recognition they deserve.But the practical actions that iniduals and families take in the weeks ahead will also make all the dference.As other countries have shown, no health service in the world could cope with the number of patients who would need treatmentbetween us we failed to slow the spread of coronavirus.That is why the Government’s measures to stop people meeting and passing on the virus are so important.Nobody is finding this easy — whether it is missing a drink with friends in the pub, Sunday lunch with the family or uncertainty over jobs and wages this epidemic has created for so many.There are early signs this is working but this is a marathon not a sprint. What we need to remember is that right now every single one of us can be a le-saver just by following the medical advice.Every time you wash your hands you could keep someone off of a ventilator. Over the coming weeks, by staying at home you save lives. It’s as simple and as profound as that. This is truly a national effort.Each and every one of us has to play our part.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Since Boris Johnson declared the lockdown restrictions on our lives, officers have been accused by some of being overzealous enforcing them.They have tried to stop some shops selling Easter eggs because they consider them non-essential.A cop was also filmed threatening to fine a bakery owner for putting chalk on the pavement outside her shop to maintain social-distancing.Meanwhile, the Derbyshire force dyed black the Blue Lagoon swim spot in a disused Buxton quarry to deter groups from gathering there — and sent out drones to spy on walkers in the middle of nowhere.Road blocks have been set up to check motorists and cyclists are on essential journeys.Last weekend officers were also breaking up groups of more than two people on park benches, and football matches in parks.All of which could seem a tad heavy-handed.So you can see why some people are indignant, especially given the absence of clearer official guidance.Perhaps it is this lack of clarity that is partly the issue.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a recent daily press conference that police should use common sense in applying the rules and that the public should follow the guidance not just to the letter but also the spirit.The real issue, though, is some people’s inability to follow the very basic instruction to stay at home unless they really need to go out.If people were not disregarding this advice, police would not have to enforce it.Officers do need to be careful, though.We are willing to social-distance for the greater good but only as long as it is necessary — and will not tolerate it for a minute longer.We are not a police state and the police must be mindful of being too heavy-handed.So while shouting at someone for buying an Easter egg is ridiculous and using a drone to terrorise a lone dog walker does seem extreme, someone has to break up the cretins who are having barbecues or parties in high-density residential areas, right I do despair over the attitude of those mindless idiots who are still having parties and getting drunk together.Then there are the twits going to DIY shops to buy paint, which is hardly essential.People, this is not an extended Bank Holiday. It is a lockdown.It is being done to save your le or the le of someone you love.The bottom line is that officers have to ensure the guidelines are adhered to, but it is how they go about it that is important.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here thesun whocareswinsappealIn the meantime, police chiefs are urging snoopers to use online hotlines to tell tales about neighbours who are breaching the Government’s lockdown.Humberside has created a dedicated online portal where people can submit tip-offsthey spot gatherings of more than two people.West Midlands, Greater Manchester, and Avon and Somerset are urging the public to alert them to breaches by using online forums, rather than phoning  or .To my mind, this raises ethical questions.hould we really become a nation of snitches Should we not all just concentrate on our own families and trust that others will take care of themselves Is the act of reporting the selfish idiots who disregard the Government advice really community spirit Or is it just the ultimate curtain-twitching exercise — which encourages serious pettiness Apparently, the police have had calls from people asking them to come and arrest a neighbour for going on a second run in one day.In an ideal world we would all just abide by the rules and there would be no need to report others.Sadly, though, needs must.If your neighbour is driving to the seaside when you are stuck indoors at home, they are ruining the purpose of this lockdown for everyone, they are selfish and they should be stopped.If people do not abide by the rules, what choice do you have Butyou do just stay home there will be no need to worry about whether your neighbours are phoning the police about you.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day -

This is nowhere near good enough.As Boris Johnson croaked from his sick bed, mass testing among the general population is the ONLY way out of this national purgatory.But at the moment we do not even have widespread testing among our NHS workers.Right now we are letting down those selfless doctors, nurses and health carers.On Thursday night at pm, my street in North London resounded to the sound of grateful clapping for our carers.But as our frontline health workers start to die, they need more than a weekly standing ovation.They need us to understand that the lockdown rules apply to us all.Lucy Hutchings, , is a nurse caring for coronavirus patients in Southampton.In a Facebook post, shared , times, she wrote it is “devastating” to see so much suffering when there are still people not following simple rules about staying home, staying safe and protecting the NHS.“I’m scared, everybody I work with is scared,” wrote Lucy, her face etched with exhaustion after another gruelling -hour sht.“The quicker people stay indoors, the quicker it will be over.“I’d like to stay at home but I can’t, so for people to go against the rules is so stupid and irresponsible.“I keep myself away from my mum, dad and brother because I don’t want to pass the virus on. It’s a hard thing to do.”Lucy’s face should haunt us all.Remember it every time some thick-as-mince footballer wraps his expensive motor around a lamppost.Remember Lucy’s face every time you see people who think social isolation rules do not apply to them.Remember Lucy’s faceyou want to understand what a long way we have to go before we truly start supporting the NHS.Yes, it is hard for a people raised in freedom to obey these restrictive rules.But NOBODY has a harder job right now than those NHS workers who are risking their lives in under-equipped, overcrowded hospitals that are being pushed to breaking point and beyond.The health crisis is unprecedented in our letime but the Government cannot keep cocking it up.The NHS does not have the kit it needs, the testing it needs, the support it needs.Health Secretary Matt Hancock promises , coronavirus tests a day by the end of April.If Hancock does not deliver, get shot of him.Because right now, that “Protect the NHS” slogan is looking heartbreakingly empty.All foreign NHS workers who are out there now fighting on the frontline deserve British passports.If these foreign heroes are good enough to risk their lives to save our lives, then they have earned the right to stay in the UK for ever.CLAUDIA Schfer tells Elle magazine that at the height of her supermodel glory days she felt like a rock star.

The Steph Show, hosted by the former BBC Breakfast presenter, from her Yorkshire home, with nothing for company but a mission statement: “It’s a power hour of positivity.”An easy thing to claim, an impossible thing to deliver without ideas, creativity, content or anything other than secondhand clips and the same old guestsyou’ve seen clogging up every other show recently.The Steph Show has one thing and one thing only in its favour, though. Honesty.She promised viewers it “might be a bit rough around the edges”, and has been utterly faithful to her word, starting last Monday, when Steph went hurtling round her house to show off the remote cameras and then spent the next ten minutes gasping for air.Over the following  minutes, Skype links maled, mobile phones went off and an attempt to kick off a feature about weird dreams, with Keith Lemon, was shut down as quickly as it started.“What did you ask Michael Hutchence in your dream ”“Things he did romantically with Kylie Minogue that . . . ” “OK, let’s move on.”Had you thought day two was going to improve things, you probably banished those thoughts when Steph began with her own epitaph: “If you tuned in yesterday, you’ll know this is the show that isn’t meant to be on yet.”Or any other day for that matter, although Tuesday’s episode was a technical cracker and climaxed when someone rang Steph’s doorbell, mid-episode. We never did find out who, but I’m willing to bet good money it wasn’t Bafta.And so this hypnotic mess continued throughout the week.Thursday, however, was the day the edice really crumbled, as Steph attempted to lead a mass, safe-distance dancing demonstration, from a car-park in Bristol.Until it transpired the choreographer was at such a safe distance from her CD player it’d be another minute or so before it could start.Honestly, you’ve never heard a silence so awkward or so deafening and it was hard not to have a measure of sympathy for Steph and her production team, who’ve clearly been thrown under a bus by Channel .I say a measure of sympathy, because professional northerner Steph is hardly the underdog she’d have you believe.Her close friend, Sinead Rocks, is MD for the regions at Channel ’s Leeds HQ and, while there’s no suggestion she had anything to do with her recruitment, there’s always an assumption Steph McGovern is “a good thing”.Having never concentrated on her work before I’m going to assume this is for box-ticking, rather than professional, reasons, because, based on her performance here, she’s not a good presenter.For a start, she chunters for Britain, has a knack for saying exactly the wrong thingand crunches the gears during an interview like Jack Grealish heading back to lockdown.: “Provided the last laugh in Germany, did you  What are your tips for attracting wildle ” Eh  There’s more than a hint of The Fast Show about her as well.Absolutely everything is “brilliant”, especially when it’s not.

he even handed over pictures of himself in shorts and a vest to a TV channel use for their profile of him.The Foreign Secretary has a poster of Muhammad Ali in his House of Commons office and still trains at his local boxing club in Surrey.Former Brexit Secretary David Davis was more impressed with Mr Raabs karate black belt than his TWO degrees - an undergraduate from Oxford and a masters from Cambridge - when he gave him the job as his chief of staff.Mr Raab has said he turned to karate to help him deal with the grief of losing his father when he was only twelve.His father, Peter, fled to the UK from Czechoslovakia when he was just six-years-old to escape the Nazis, but died of cancer when Mr Raab was a boy.He said last year: Sport helped restore my confidence, and that hugely benefited my attitude to school and le.There were strong role models, camaraderie and an ethos of respect.I take the discipline and focus I learnt from sport into my professional le - and I believe that approach is vital to making a success of the Brexit negotiations and delivering a fairer deal from Brussels.During the leadership campaign he released pictures of his Jewish relatives who were murdered in the Holocaust and paid tribute to his dads incredible story.Peter Raab escaped from his home country, being forced to leave most of his family behind to be murdered for their beliefs.The stand-in PM was born in Buckinghamshire, grew up in Gerrards Cross and went to Dr Challoners Grammar School, before going to Oxford University.The importance of respect he learnt from boxing and karate translated into his political career, and he was upset by civil servants who anonymously described him as a bully when he was the Brexit Secretary.He denied claims by his former diary secretary that he insisted on the same Pret a Manger lunch every day.His daily order was apparently a chicken Caesar salad, bacon baguette, superfruit pot and vitamin volcano smoothie - a meal fit for a boxer.Mr Raab, who is the MP for the seat of Esher and Walton, ran against the PM to be Tory party leader after Theresa May resigned.Hes served in his current post since July .Before that he had a very brief stint as the Brexit Secretary but quit in protest of Mrs Mays plans for Brexit.Altogether hes had just over one year of Cabinet experience -

but not the second top job.But Mr Raab is a hardline Brexiteer, and his position in Cabinet makes sense given Boris promise to get Brexit done.He was one of the most vocal supporters of leaving the EU and his appointment gave other Brexiteers the conviction in the PM to really deliver on Brexit.But Downing Street made clear the First Secretary would step inthe PM needed him to.Since taking up the post Mr Raab had to wade into the thorny diplomatic controversy over the death of British teenager Harry Dunn.The teen was killed when his motorbike crashed into a car near Northamptonshire in August last year.The young boys parents tried to heckle Mr Raab at a constituency hustings because they felt he hadnt helped get justice for their son by failing to pursuade the US to extradite Harrys alleged killer - Anne Sacoolas.He has also had to manage the controversial issue of repatriation of children of British jihadists.He got himself into hot water in May  when he said that people who use food banks are not typically in poverty but have an occasional cashflow problem.Critics labelled the remarks stupid and deeply offensive.Last year, he threatened to keep open the option of suspending Parliament to prevent MPs blocking Brexit.He was the target of a relentless campaign in his Surrey seat in last years election and was almost ousted.His previous majority of , votes was shrunk to just , - and now hes the de facto Prime Minister.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappeal  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

with Department of Health and Social Care in providing the advice that is necessary to work out how the systems will work.“We also have our Defence Science and Technology Laboratory in Porton Down is

supported by others.He also insisted the current lockdown measures were unlikely to go on beyond six months, but said the military would not need to get involved in the event of any civil disruption.Sir Nick said: I think its most unlikely that we would get involved in public order at all.Generally speaking our role in this is to back-fill the police in those roles that dont face the

domestic flights coronavirus lockdown","story":"WUHAN residents have made a dash to leave the city by road, air and train as the citys -day lockdown is finally lted. Pictures showed hundreds of cars arriving at motorway toll gates and travellers gathering outside transport hubs in the city, where the coronavirus outbreak first began in December. Wuhan has now recorded zero new deaths for the first time since the pandemic began, prompting authorities to go ahead with plans to lt a citywide quarantine imposed in January.Residents were allowed to leave the city as of midnight local time, and the airport is now preparing to reopen to domestic flights.According the state-owned China News Service, domestic passenger services at Wuhan Tianhe International Airport will resume on April .Before entering the terminal, passengers will be required to scan a Wuhan Fighting Epidemic QR code and show their green code”, a QR code issued in Hubei indicating the traveller is healthy.Passengers will also get their temperatures taken and those above .C will be “treated according to the relevant epidemic prevention rules”, said the China News Service.Anyone leaving by road will be allowed to do so without special authorisation as long as they have a mandatory application installed on their smartphones.The app is powered by a mix of data-tracking and government surveillance, and shows whether the user is healthy and whether they have recently been in contact with anyone confirmed to have the virus.Trains are also scheduled to run from Wuhan to destinations across China, with the first due to leave for capital Beijing at .am local time.  With the pandemic hitting hard across the world, officially the number of coronavirus cases in China is dwindling, ever since the Government imposed sweeping measures to keep the disease from spreading.More than . million people around the world have been diagnosed with Covid-, and there have been more than , deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker.Last month, authorities began easing restrictions on the residents of Wuhan, which has endured months of an extraordinary lockdown to curb the spread of the virus.The National Health Commission said it had  confirmed cases, down from  on Monday.In total, the Chinese Government confirmed that more than , people have died and , have been confirmed as infected.It comes as the Chinese Government came under scrutiny as to whether it was underreporting its figures.Officials are now concerned that a second wave of infections could be brought in by foreign arrivals.It has already shut its border to foreigners including those with visas or residence permits.International flights have been reduced with both Chinese and foreign airlines only allowed to operate one international flight a week — and must not be more than  per cent full.Some people in epidemic-free residential compounds in Wuhan have already been allowed to leave their homes for two hours.But Wuhan officials revoked the epidemic-free status in  compounds because of the emergence of asymptomatic cases and for other unspecied reasons.Asymptomatic refers to someone who is carrying the virus but experiencing no symptoms.China began reporting asymptomatic cases at the beginning of April.More than , asymptomatic patients are under medical observation.Hitting back at claims China was too slow to raise the alarm, the countrys state media have published what they describe as a detailed timeline of its response and information sharing. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I have dementia. Am I classed as vulnerable or high risk A. Dementia does not put you at greater physical risk of coronavirus but the way in which dementia might affect you could potentially put you in harm’s way. For example, it might be easier to forget that you should not have visitors or have close contact with somebody making deliveries to your door.Routines like hand washing might not be thorough enough. Stay home, physically distance and make a list of the things you need to do to keep yourself safe.Q. When do you expect people will build up enough antibodies not to catch the virus a second time A. We cannot be sure yet how long immunity takes to be established and how long it lasts because this is a very new virus. It is thought that antibodies will be measurable after about  days. Immunity should be present straight after the acute illness when symptoms have disappeared. Q. Can you catch the virus from hanging your washing out on the line A. No. You should be absolutely safe doing this. The virus needs a human host and fresh air kills it quickly.Q. Is it still safe to cuddle and kiss my cat A. The virus does not easily jump species and I have seen no evidence that cats and dogs have become unwell with this infection. If somebody with the virus sneezed or coughed over your pet there is a slight chance the virus could be transmitted from their fur to you. Frequent hand washing should take care of that and you can safely cuddle your pets.Q. I work on a supermarket checkout and have Achalasia. Am I in the high risk group and should I be working A. You are not in a high-risk group. Your condition is mainly a digestive one. You just need to take the same precautions as everyone .Q. I work for MS. After every sht I shower and wash my work clothes. I have heard that I have to wash my hair too. Is this correct A. The chances of any coronavirus to which you have been exposed living for anyof time on your hair is very remote. Clinically speaking I don’t think there is a need to wash your hair every day.Q. Can you catch coronavirus from people vaping A. The virus is present in the exhaled breath of someone who is infected. The vapour from vaping liquids would neither make ithe virus more transmissible nor kill it off. The same would apply to cigarettes.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Q. I have aches in my neck, a sore throat and a tickly cough. Is this just a normal cold or should I isolate A. If the tickly cough is dry, unproductive of phlegm, persis- tent and not something you have had before you should self- isolate to be on the safe side.Q. I’m suffering bad anxiety and my chest is uncomfortable. I’m scared it’s coronavirus. What should I do A. Many people are very anxious at the moment and that often causes altered breathing. Some people breathe too fast when they feel panicky and others just become overly conscious of what is normally an unconscious activity. In the absence of other symptoms, try to relax, distract your mind from worry, exercise gently and phone a trusted friend to share your feelings.Q. How do I get my monthly prescriptions delivered  I am over , plus have an underlying illness.A. Contact your usual pharmacy, where your regular prescriptions are issued. Many have already set up a delivery service to people in your position and in the last few days the Government’s health and social care secretary has pledged millions of pounds to assist this process for other chemists. You should not need to worry about supplies.Q. I have heard people who have had the virus are being told they canto work after seven days. Is this long enoughthey are still coughing A. The guidance isyou live alone and have been self-isolating for seven days then feel completely well you can resume your normal activities. This is true evenyou still have a dry cough as it is considered you will no longer be shedding the virus when you cough.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That isn’t a position we are in yet.He added: We will be reviewing it and we will be led by the scientic evidence when its the right time.We need to start seeing the numbers coming down and thats when youre in the negative.Thats when you have a sense when thats sustained over a period of time, that you can see it coming out of that.Both Mr Raab and Professor Whitty stressed that Britain needs to reach the peak first before looking at whether the lockdown measures can be changed or relaxed.Government sources stressed earlier that a formal review of the lockdown may not happen on Monday but would be around that date.Professor Whitty said last night: Its really important we get to the point we are confident we are beyond the peak.There are a large number of dferent things we need to take into account here.Meanwhile the London Mayor said today that the peak is not expected to be this weekend as previously thought.Sadiq Khan told BBCs Radio : We think the peak is probably still a week and a half away.We are still on a daily basis seeing too many people losing their lives.He added that the capital was nowhere near being able to lt restrictions.World Health Organisation Europe director Dr Hans Kluge warned countries not to ease social distancing restrictions.It is, once again, the time to double or triple collective efforts with the support of society.Italy has already extended its own lockdown measures until at least the middle of May.The Italian lockdown was due to end initially on March  but has already been extended twice.Even in China, areas of Wuhan are still only just coming out of lockdown after being kept inside for two months.Last week Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed that the crucial anti-body test that will identy whether an inidual has had the virus will not be included in the new target to reach , tests a day by the end of the month.This is despite the test being central to the Government’s exit strategy for ending the lockdown measures.It all-but confirms the Government will be forced to extend the current lockdown rules when they are up for their three-week review on April .Yesterday a record  deaths were recorded - taking the total dead above ,.But yesterday experts said the data showed there was some cautious optimism of the figures, and the rate of new cases may be slowing.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Government departments have started to work on plans to end the lockdown in the coming weeks, but no decisions have been made.Today one minister suggested that schools could be the first thing to re-open - possibly as soon as after the Easter break.One told the Financial Times: We need to be led by the science, of course. Butwe can reopen schools after the Easter holidays things could begin to get back to normal.It could kick-start the economy,” a senior minister said.No would only say it would be “guided by the science”.Several ministers are said to believe schools should reopen two weeks after the Easter holidays.Yesterday a study by University College London found that school closures had a relatively small impact on the spread of coronavirus.Experts said weeks ago that they were unlikely to shut schools until they needed to as it was not expected to have a major impact.It has also been suggested that the lockdown could have a staggered end - such as allowing dferent sectors of workers or areas in the country out first.But key to ending the shutdown will be mass testing for everyone, Matt Hancock said last week.However, efforts have been severely restricted by the fact that no home kit test to showsomeones had the virus has yet been deemed to be accurate enough.Ministers are calling on the industry to step up and seethey can develop a finger-prick test which can be done at home.None of the tests so far have been shown to work.When one does, ministers want to ship millions of them out so that those who have had the disease can be given immunity certicates or a wristband to show they have had it and are likely to be immune.Last night the PM spent his second night in intensive care after he started to struggle to breathe.The Times reported that his persistent fever - which had not gone away since he fell ill - has finally started to ease.This morning Dominic Raab - who is standing in for him - said he was doing fine.He is said to be still stable and has not yet required a ventilator to help him breathe.The PM has had oxygen, but its not known what other treatment hes had.And he is said to still be in good spirits.Medical experts have predicted that Mr Johnson may need several weeks off work to recuperate from his ordeal once he is able to leave intensive care.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

including how and when to end the lockdown.If Mr Johnson was forced to rest and recover for an extended period time, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab would continue to take control of the government after he was asked to stand-in for the PM yesterday.This means he would have extra powers such as chairing National Security meetings, but he would not have weekly meetings with the Queen.He would also have to seek permission from the National Security Council in order to launch  any military action.One father, Matt Dockray,  who was treated in ICU for COVID- said it was a long road of recovery.He told Good Morning Britain: Theres still a long road of recovery, it takes about six to eight weeks, but you can sit here and tell the tale and fight this.Mr Dockray was healthy before being infected.He said: There was a point where you sort of started to lose hope and thought that was it, because youve seen this on the TV, youve seen the pictures of Italy.Mr Raab said last night any decisions made on ending the lockdown would be made collectively by Cabinet, and could not answerhe would overrule ministersthere was signicant disagreement.He said: I’ve been given a clear steer from the PM — very clear instructions in terms of dealing with coronavirus.He’s asked me to deputise for him for as long as is necessary, but the normal cabinet collective responsibility and principles that inform that will apply.Power of Britains nuclear arsenal, which normally rests with the PM, would sit with Mr Raab and the Cabinetneeded.Mr Raab will also be chairing the Cobra meetings where decisions on extending lockdown are expected to be reviewed later this week.Decisions will be informed by experts assessments on the scale of the outbreak.But Mr Raab will ultimately need to make a political call over extending them and restricting iniduals freedom.Even people who have not needed hospitalisation for suspected cases of coronavirus have said they were knocked sideways by the disease for  days or more. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-UK-CORONAVIRUS-MAP-DEATHS-IN-OUT--APRIL-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CORONAVIRUS-SYMPTOMS.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

on Easter Monday.But the number of deaths across the UK has been steadily rising, with Sadiq Khan today warning the peak is still around  days away.The Government is unlikely to lt the lockdown while deaths are so high and with the NHS still under signicant pressure.But officials may consider reopening schools in a bid to help the nation get back to normal, one minister suggested.Speaking to the Times, an unnamed senior minister said: We need to be led by the science, of course.“Butwe can reopen schools after the Easter holidays things could begin to get back to normal.It could kick-start the economy.”Several ministers are said to believe schools should reopen two weeks after the Easter holidays.Currently only the children of key workers are allowed to send their kids in.But a DfE spokesperson said this afternoon: Schools will remain closed until further notice, except for children of critical workers and the children who are most vulnerable.We will re-open schools when the scientic advice indicates it is safe to do so.Sources stressed that they would be guided by the science and that it was very unlikely that schools would be reopened while the rest of the country is still on lockdown.Denmarks government has already announced plans to reopen schools for children aged  and under.No insisted today that there would be a review of the three-week lockdown at some point next week -

Something like a sneeze or cough near you would become less likely to cause infection. It’s a small reduction in risk, but might be very important to especially vulnerable people.Wearing masks at home also seemed to reduce the odds of well housemates become ill - and there was a  per cent risk reductionboth an ill person and their well contacts wore masks.But, as people have lots of repeated types of contact in a home setting, there are many ways for the germs to transmit. This is why washing hands remains so important, the researcher advised.One of the problems of widespread use of the facial protection is that, its dficult to wear masks correctly for many hours over many days. They can be uncomfortable, hot, cause skin reactions or simply feel anti-social. Masks also need to be disposed of correctly to prevent transmission.“And of course, wearing a mask interferes with things like sleep, eating and brushing teeth. It’s impossible to keep them on all the time.“We found that wearing face masks was also not that protective during large gatherings, she added.The UEA points out that mass buying by the public has created a shortage for healthcare workers, including those risking their lives on the frontline in hospitals.With a shortage of protective gear, including face masks, theres been a rising tally of NHS staff dying after treating coronavirus patients.Brits will not be required to wear masks in public despite a host of other nations including the US changing their advice.Thats because the UK believes there is very little evidence of widespread benefit for members of the public.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said last week that the Governments health advisers had not told him to change the UK’s approach to members of the public wearing face masks.He said there was little evidence to show the masks help and would be better used by healthcare workers and patients who test positive.The UKs stance is at odds with an increasing number of countries now advising their citizens to wear some form of face covering when they head outdoors.The US has changed its stance and is preparing to formalise new guidance to recommend Americans cover their mouth with items such as bandanas, snoods, scarves, T-shirts or homemade cloththey cannot access a mask.Officials in New York City are already urging people to wear masks when they go outside.Mayor Bill de Blasio said coverings for the nose and mouth can be real homegrown and made from a scarf or bandana.Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti has also encouraged his citys residents to cover their faces when out in public.Austria said on April  that it would start reopening shops from next week - but it widened a requirement to wear face masks.On April , the World Health Organization reiterated that medical masks should be prioritised for health workers.But it opened the door to greater public use of homemade masks or other mouth coverings as a way to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.Dr Mike Ryan, the WHO’s top emergencies expert, told reporters: The idea of using respiratory coverings or mouth coverings to prevent coughing or sneezing projecting disease into the environment and towards others ... that in itself is not a bad idea.”A few days later, however, WHO backtracked by saying the wearing of medical masks by the general public could exacerbate the shortage for health workers on the front lines of the Covid- pandemic.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Gheybresus told reporters: “We are concerned that the mass use of medical masks by the general population could exacerbate the shortage of these specialised masks for the people who need them most.“Masks alone cannot stop the pandemic, countries must continue to find, test, isolate and treat every case and trace every contact.”Cellular microbiology expert Dr Simon Clarke, University of Reading, welcomed the WHO review as “inappropriate use of masks could lead to a  sense of security and cause people to neglect other, essential hygiene and distancing measures. “The advice remains that anyone with symptoms should wear a mask, but the UK goes beyond that by telling infected people to stay at home. “It remains the case that your front door will contain the virus much more effectively than any face mask.In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC advises ”the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.  Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure.Although the CDC recommends wearing cloth masks, UEA researchers said there’s very little scientic evidence showing cloth masks protect people from respiratory illnesses.Cloth masks have large pores and allow moist air circulation – which means cloth masks are less likely to stop virus contaminated droplets from getting through. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Employees whose industry is hit by coronavirus can have % of their wage paid by the state under the Job Retention Scheme.But they must do no work for that firm at all. HM Revenue and Customs chief executive Jim Harra today admitted some employees on furlough are already being told to carry on working. He also confessed the vast scheme is a target for organised crime, with mobsters trying to get free money from the government.Thousands of tax officials are working flat out to prepare the scheme for its April  opening date after it began limited testing today. Reports today suggest the massive job retention scheme, which pays firms % of a workeraposs wage up to £, a month, will cost the government £bn. The UK’s tax chief admitted it is “quite uncertain” how many people will be furloughed or for how long. Mr Harra said HMRC’s servers have been tested for , claims an hour, and will be open  . But he admitted it will be a “challenging and testing period” with “very high volume” of claims - andmost claims come within a few days, staff will “struggle”.  “I’m sure we will be calling on people’s patience”, he told the Commons Treasury Committee. “Obviouslya million employers all try to ring us on the same day it will not be possible for me to deploy enough resources to handle all those calls at the same time.” Mr Harra warned taxpayers may be asked only to call HMRC about emergencies or the job retention scheme, and nothing , during the peak week. The job retention scheme will open in full on April  and payments will take four to six working days to arrive after the date of claim. There will be , staff to man a helpline including , redeployed from other areas in government. Mr Harra said “time has been the enemy of perfection” and a similar scheme without an emergency would have taken “a year or two” to set up.And he admitted the hurried scheme has prompted a “range of fraud and abuse risks”. “Any scheme that involves paying out money I’m afraid attracts criminals who want to exploit it,” he told the Treasury Committee. Weaposre going to be paying out a vast sum of money in a very rapid period of time. Any scheme like this is a target for organised crime. We believe weaposre striking the right balance between protecting the Exchequer from that kind of abuse, and the imperative to get help out to those who need it as fast as we possibly can.  Workers on the aposfurloughapos scheme cannot do any work at all for their firm and cannot use it to scale back their hours to go part-time. They are still allowed to undertake unpaid training, or work for other employers like the farming industry or NHS. Firms can also put put small groups of workers on furlough “rotation”, so  are furloughed for a month, then a dferent  for another month. Employees must be off for a minimum of three weeks each. Mr Harra told MPs: “We expect the vast majority of employers to do the right thing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"larry cat not coronavirus lockdown","story":"NewsLarry the Cat is not in coronavirus lockdown despite advice from vets groupThe British Veterinary Association said cats from infected households should stay indoorspossible - but Number  say Larry is absolutely fineShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video larry-cat-relaxes-outside--,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics larry-cat-not-coronavirus-lockdown-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Londonaposs mayor said the capital is still seeing too many people losing their lives and must brace for drastic restrictions to last much longer. Boris Johnson originally said the ban on leaving home without good reason would be reviewed after three weeks - which expire at the end of the Easter weekend. But the government has now made clear it will last for longer - and health minister Edward Argar today admitted I donapost know when it will end. The key factor to decide when the lockdown is listed will be when new cases each day peak and start to fall. Reports had suggested government officials were looking at Easter Sunday as the possible date of the peak. But that is now just four days away. While there are early signs of infections slowing down, scientists say they wonapost know for certain for a week or more. London mayor Sadiq Khan told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “I think we’re nowhere near lting the lockdown. “I speak to experts regularly, in fact after this I’ll have another call with Public Health England and NHS London experts. “We think the peak which is the worst part of the virus is still probably a week and half away.”  Health minister Edward Argar said there was now a “tiny hint” that infections were “slowing down”. But he does not know when the Governmentaposs lockdown restrictions will be lted, adding weaposre not there yet. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Argar said: We need to start seeing the numbers coming down and thataposs when youaposre in the negative. Thataposs when you have a sense when thataposs sustained over a period of time, that you can see it coming out of that. Weaposre not there yet and I donapost exactly know when we will be.The law does not say the lockdown can roll on indefinitely - it must be reviewed in some form. It says a Cabinet minister must review the need for restrictions and requirements under the emergency law at least once every  days, with the first review being carried out by th April . The emergency powers ban people from going outside without a list of good reasons, including shopping for essentials, doing essential work, a medical need or once a day for exercise. The law also bans gatherings of more than two people in public, unless theyaposre from the same household. Offenders can be fined £ to start with by police, rising to almost £, by the time it is a third offence. Ministers have not ruled out a phasedto normality where dferent sectors or parts of the country could come out of lockdown earlier than others.  This could reportedly include reopening schools. But according to the Times, No aides fear the public will not accept a bit-by-bit approach because it will mean one rule for some people and another rule for others. The government’s chief scientic officer Sir Patrick last night said the number of new cases “could be moving in the right direction” - but it would not be clear “for a week or so”. He told the daily Downing Street press conference: “It’s possible that we’re beginning to see the beginning of change in terms of the curve flattening a little bit. “We won’t know that for sure for a week or so. “There hasn’t been the accelerated take-off and again it’s possible that we’re beginning to see the start of a change where we might see numbers flattening off.

Dr Diana Gall, from Doctor  U, says the feeling of exhaustion when we lose our daily routines can become a vicious cycle - the less you, the more tired you feel, so the less you feel like doing. Spending longer periods of time in the same position can decrease your levels of oxygen, leading to a drop in energy and motivation, as reported by . Dr Gall said: The reason you feel tired, lethargic and lazy after doing nothing is simply because you’re allowing your body to feel that way as it is tired from the lack of stimulation and movement that it is used to.

And England’s Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty has stressed it is not yet possible to “call the point” at which we start to relax lockdown. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true\" A Senior Whitehall source said: “If you talk to the Treasury, they’ll tell you we can do this for another month, two months tops, before we start doing damage to the economy that we won’t be able to undo. “But Health and Downing Street are holding firm – this will last as long as it needs to last until we think we can keep the deaths as low as possible.”  But our appetite for greater freedoms is being whetted by the tempting noises being made by our European neighbours.

Spain has suggested some economic restrictions could be lted after Easter. France has hinted at the possibility of easing lockdown in phases, region by region, “subject to a new testing policy – depending, possibly, on age and other factors”.  And Italy, scene of such horrying scenes, has suggested a “phase ” would have testing at its heart. Further afield, China, too, has highlighted testing and contact tracing – tracking all those with symptoms and anyone they have been in contact with. Strategies here y widely. One is a phased relaxation and civil servants have been asked to draw up options for this kind of segmented release.This could pivot on a region-by-region approach or the gradual expansion of workers regarded as key, or the slow reopening of certain businesses. Prof Andrew Oswald, of the University of Warwick, believes age would be the safest and most effective indicator to use. His suggestion is to initially “release” only  to  year olds from lockdown, as they are the “safest among us”. This would mean . million people – only those who don’t live in the parental home and wouldn’t pose a risk to older people. They are also the group hardest hit by a loss of livelihood. He explained: “It’s quite a simple idea, but it might make a good first stage in an exit strategy... We could restart a fth or a sixth of the economy in this way.”Prof Paul Hunter, of the University of East Anglia, outlines four more “strategies” for leaving lockdown. But none is quick and he can’t see any relaxation being introduced until the end of May. . The herd immunity model The first is reliant on knowing the percentage of herd immunity in the country. Once that has reached  or %, he says – not necessarily the height needed to stop infection spread – he believes lockdown could be reduced. But, critically, he said, “only testing will allow us to know that data.” And the antibody test being promoted by the Government about a week ago, which checkssomeone has recovered from Covid-, looks to be nowhere near ready for roll out. None checked so far has met “the criteria for a good test”. . The tracing model Prof Hunter outlines a second strategy as following China’s tracing model – seemingly also preferred by Germany. But this first depends on numbers reducing considerably and, again, testing availability. He explained: “You keep the lockdown until there are few,any, cases and this is followed by rigorous contact tracing and isolation of cases, and their contacts when they are identied.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ramadan eid 2020 how coronavirus","story":"NewsRamadan and Eid : How coronavirus lockdown will affect Muslims holy monthRamadan is expected to start on April  and lasts for a month, but the coronavirus pandemic has forced traditional mass gatherings, celebrations and pilgrimages to be altered or cancelledShareCommentsByJamie Hawkins:,  APR NewsThis years Ramadan will be like no other due to the coronavirus pandemic \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe Muslim Holy month of Ramadan starts later this month - but how will the coronavirus pandemic affect it  Religious communities have had to take dferent measures that affect day to day lives, and with Ramadan just around the corner, things may look very dferent for British Muslims. Mosques have been closed and gatherings of large groups of people have been banned, meaning no communal prayers for the time being. Ramadan is expected to begin on April  and will see a month long period of worship and devotion to Allah. It commemorates the Quraposan being first revealed to the prophet Muhammad.But for the first time for many, they will be forced to observe this period dferently. Virtual fast breaking   Iftar, which means breaking the fast, is traditionally a meal shared with extended family and friends. Some mosques across Britain cook meals every night for the community to break fast. However, lockdown restrictions means this wonapost be possible, so communities have come up with dferent ways for this to happen. The Ramadan Tent Project is to hold a virtual Iftar on the first day of Ramadan, and this will continue throughout the month. A live call to prayer will also happen every day. The team is also sending out packs for people to create their perfect Iftar experience. How will prayers be affected     In the UK and across the world, mosques have closed due to the Covid- outbreak. Usually, during Ramadan, extended prayers called tarawih take place every evening. Mosques pack out for the whole month, but they many will have to rethink plans. In Egypt, all public religious gatherings have been banned during Ramadan, with all mosques and churches closed to worshipers. The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cougha feverIf you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS  unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains. Sneezing is not a symptom of the coronavirus. Instead, prayer calls are broadcast via loudspeakers. In the US, some mosques will live stream evening prayers, whilst in Kuwait, those taking part are encouraged to pray in your homes. Meanwhile, in the UK, the Muslim Council of Britain  said there should be an immediate suspension of prayer servicesthe outbreak continues at the projected rate. Changes to fasting    Fasting during Ramadan is obligatory, although exceptions are made for a iety of reasons including for children, pregnant women and the elderly. This year there will be more sick people who can’t participate in the fasting. There is a guidance that allows children, pregnant women, the elderly and the sick to not fast during the month, and, of course, this means those suffering from coronavirus won’t take part in the fasting. But, with schools forced to close and people working from home, it could actually benefit those fasting. One perk to fasting during the lockdown will be doing it from home, says Shahida Rahman, a trustee at Cambridge Central Mosque. She told CambridgeshireLive: “It can be dficult going to work whilst fasting, but I’ll be at home which will be comforting. I’ll be able to relax and keep busy.” Away from the exhaustion and temptation of a working office, she’ll be able to start the day in peace with the suhoor, she explains, the meal before sunrise each day, and the tar, the breaking of the fast with a meal after sunset. How will it affect Eid celebrations     Eid-ul-fitr is the big celebration at the end of Ramadan - where families usually come together to celebrate the monthaposs achievement. It traditionally sees big gatherings, parties, and families visiting. But this is likely to be affected more than Ramadan this year. Although alternatives to prayers have been planned, Eid usually sees millions of Muslims outside celebrating. The largest Eid celebration in Europe is held in Birmingham, which sees around , gather at Small Heath park.  Green Lane Masjid and Community Centre chief executive Kamran Hussain told Birmingham Live: It would be hugely optimistic to assume that we will have any kind of normality like this over the next couple of months. Lockdown restrictions will likely see celebrations kept to a minimum for the first time, which will see many elderly observers home alone during the end of Ramadan. Charity efforts Ramadan is a time to help those who are less fortunate, with fundraising events a common way to show kindness throughout the month. According to the Muslim Charities Forum , Muslims donate at least £m to charitable causes during the month. Volunteers tend to pack Ramadan food bags for those less fortunate, but food shortages across the world due to coronavirus will see many families suffer. This year, any fundraising is expected to take place through online donation websites. Will pilgrimages be cancelled    Ramadan usually sees millions travel to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia before and after the tradition. But coronavirus has seen restrictions enforced, with Meccaaposs Grand Mosque temporarily closing in March for a deep clean to help fight the spread of the disease.

He sexually abused the eight-year-old before killing her and dumping her tiny body. The Payne family were spending what should have been an idyllic family holiday with their grandparents in the village of Kingston Gorse in West Sussex. Sarah and her siblings - Charlotte, Lee and Luke - were happily playing in cornfields close to her grandparents house. As they laughed in the early evening sunshine, Whiting was lurking - waiting and watching - ready to pounce when he could. So when Sarah hit her head during a game of hide and seek and ran off crying he snatched her from the cornfield and hurled her into his waiting van. Her brothers and younger sister were unaware of the horror that was unfolding just feet away from them. Despite a huge search for the missing youngster,  days later Sarahaposs tiny body was found, naked and dumped in a shallow grave and a murder probe was launched. For  hours, her family launched a frantic search for missing Sarah. Police and volunteers scoured the local area and soon the hunt went national. Sarahaposs parents made desperate TV appeals for information about their daughter and appealed for her safe- and then their worst nightmares came true. And the heartache would continue as the hunt for little Sarahaposs killer went on. Officers had arrested Whiting in the days after Sarahaposs abduction but there was no concrete evidence against him and he was released. Then, on July , he stole a car and was chased by police before crashing it and being arrested and jailed for  months. While he was behind bars detectives carried out forensic tests on his van and on September , , Whiting was finally charged with the abduction and murder of Sarah Payne. Described at his murder trial as a moving prison the van contained a horrying array of equipment - perfect for the abduction, sex assault and murder of children. It contained a kne, ropes, baby oil and plastic ties that were looped like handcuffs. At his murder trail pathologist Vesna Djurovic told the court Sarah had suffered a ‘violent’ death, probably asphyxia - in a sexually motivated attack. She described how decomposition had made it impossible to say what injuries the child had suffered. The little girl was naked with dry vegetation attached to her body. Most of her hair had come away with the roots. It was this ball of hair that was to prove conclusive in the case against Whiting. It contained  fibres of material - two which matched the red sweatshirt found in his van. Eleven came from socks found in the Fiat and one fibre matched the passenger seat front cover. A blue fibre found in the hair matched a fibre in the sweatshirt. Britainaposs leading forensic expert, Raymond Chapman, told Whitingaposs trial that out of  hairs found on the sweatshirt, only one provided a DNA profile which matched Sarah. He added: The chances of obtaining a matchthe hair came from somebody  is in the order of a billion to one. But the evidence of Sarahaposs older brother, Lee, was some of the most compelling heard at the murder trial. He described how he had seen Whiting’s van pulling away, its wheels spinning and skidding with a screeching sound. Whiting was grinning and waving at Lee. The youngster told the court: He was quite scruffy, looking like he hadnapost shaved for ages. He had little white stubbles on his face and little bits of grey in his hair. He was greasy and stuff. He had yellowish teeth when he grinned and his eyes were really white and stood out from his face. His hair was really rough and hadnapost been brushed. It was sticking up. This, coupled with the forensic evidence, was enough to convince the jury that Whiting was guilty. He was told he would be spending the rest of his le behind bars. Since her daughteraposs death, Sarahaposs mum, Sara, campaogned tirelessly for a a change in the law allowing people to ask the policesomeone with access to their child has a record for child sex offences. The child sex offender disclosure scheme in England and Wales is also known as “Sarahaposs Law”. His and Saraaposs marriage broke down under the immense strain they were under following Sarahaposs murder.

Boris Johnsonaposs lockdown was announced by the PM on March  and is due to be reviewed on Easter Monday - with the peak of the virus expected to occur this weekend. However, Londonaposs mayor warned Brits to hunker down for at least a month of coronavirus lockdown after a government minister admitted I donapost knowapos when it will end. The key factor to decide when the lockdown is listed will be when new cases each day peak and start to fall. Reports had suggested government officials were looking at Easter Sunday as the possible date of the peak. But that is now just four days away. While there are early signs of infections slowing down, scientists say they wonapost know for certain for a week or more.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThe coronavirus outbreak has led to us being bombarded with health information, which can mean it becomes harder and harder to know the facts. The quantity of the advice spread across social media, much unveried, means rumour and myth can quickly be shared Dr Gero Baiarda, an NHS GP currently on call at GPDQ - a GP-on-demand service - has outlined what he believes are  myths that need tackling. . Coronavirus is a living organism The virus, officially named Sars-CoV-, is technically not alive, Dr Baiarda said. The virus is a protein super molecule rather than a living organism. Dr Baiarda said that as a result you cannot kill the virus, but that does not mean it cannot be destroyed or allowed to decay. The time it takes to break down depends on the environmental temperature, humidity and type of material upon which it settles, he said. . People are most contagious before they even know they have the virus This is untrue, Dr Baiarda says. He said the virus invades, infects and destroys cells, allowing millions of new viruses to be created that can be passed on to others or shed on surfaces. Spread is most effective, therefore, in coughed droplets, he said. Patients who are asymptomatic can, however, pass on the virus as soon as they are infected. . Sars-CoV- is a hardy virus Dr Baiarda, says the virus is in fact surprisingly fragile, with its only protection being a thin outer layer of lipid or fat. That is why any soap or detergent, both of which break down fat, will destroy it - even washing up liquid works well, he added. It is also why it is so important that we all keep washing our hands regularly with soap and water. . If delivery drivers wear gloves, they will not spread it This is wrong. Every item that a gloved hand touches can then be contaminated, Dr Baiarda said. A recent study from the New England Journal of Medicine found the virus can survive for several hours on cardboard, he added. To stay safe, the best advice is not to touch the parcel until ideally the following day, he said. . The virus cannot be passed on by food This appears to be an area up for some debate, as Dr Baiarda adopts a stricter approach to the risks posed by food than other experts. Public Health England and the Food Standards Agency say you are very unlikely to catch the virus through food or via food packaging. Dr Baiarda said transmission through food is less likely than other means, but argues it is definitely still possible. If someone who has the virus on their hands touches food, it is very likely to become contaminated for many hours, he said. To denature and inactivate the virus, food should either be washed or cooked at °c at least for four minutes or more.  . Sanitiser with % alcohol is as effective as washing your hands in soap and water Wrong. Squirting a little bit of alcohol gel on your palms and rubbing them together is not effective, Dr Baiarda said. You need to cover the entire surface of both hands including fingers and thumbs, but this should be done only after the hands are free of any residues - such as after sneezing. The small bottles of sanitiser are part of the problem, as people assume a small amount is ample. . Drinking alcohol will prevent people from getting the virus Sadly for those who enjoy a little tipple, this is not true. The only alcohol helping to stop the spread of the virus is that found in hand sanitiser. Dr Baiarda said: This is only for external use, and even then, it is only effectiveit has a concentration of % or above,you use enough, and in the right way. . Moisturising hands after washing reduces cleanliness Dr Baiarda said: Incorrect. Moisturising the skin is very important. The virus can lodge itself in damaged skin on your hands cracked by repeated washing, so itaposs important to try to avoid this. Keeping fingernails short will reduce the risk of sheltering and passing on the virus too.  . Washing hands is not as important when self-isolating, as you are all virus-free Dr Bairada said this perspective is simply wrong. If you are bringing in shopping, deliveries and post into your home, then washing your hands remains important. Every time you wash your hands you will break the chain of infection. If in doubt, give them a wash, he added. This means for at least  seconds, with warm, soapy water and then ideally using disposable paper towels rather than a communal one.

CPAP uses pressure to send a blend of air and oxygen into the mouth at a steady rate, thereby boosting the amount of oxygen that enters the lungs. But Prof Hill said many Covid- patients eventually #xCprogress to invasive ventilation#xD. This is for people whose illness is so severe they are struggling or unable to breathe for themselves. A mechanical ventilator either does all the breathing for the patient, or assists the patient#xs own breathing.

But with his faith in his other half unwavering, Cory sits on the toilet in the bathroom, instructing that he would like a trim, with the scissors at a bit of an angle to achieve a more textured look. Emily begins by lopping off a few fairly sizeable chunks of hair from his crown, as she comments that they donapost even have the scissors which are usually used by the professionals. Quickly moving towards the front of his head, she halves theof one chunky strand before pulling a worried face and throwing the hair in the bin before Cory can see. Undeterred, she repeats the action at the fringe, and struggles to hold in her laughter. Cory laughs too until he looks up to see her holding much of what used to be his fringe before quickly saying: Honey, thataposs too much. Assuming it has come from the middle of his hair, he sounds confident he will be able to cover it up, warning Emily not to do the same when it comes to cutting his fringe.  Continuing to cut large strands of hair pretty close to his head, Emily again laughs as a very laidback Cory asks: Why are you laughing  Youaposre making me nervous. His face quickly drops when he sees the volume of hair she is holding and he repeats honey, thataposs too much! before finally standing up to inspect the damage. Realising heaposs now sporting a rather large bald patch in the middle of his fringe, he heartbreakingly says aposnoapos and aposthat is not fixableapos as Emily breaks down in tears from laughter.

If you are healthy, you only need to wear a maskyou are taking care of a person with suspected Covid- infection, it said. Prof David Heymann, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that unless people were working in healthcare settings, masks are “only for the protection of others, not for the protection of oneself”. He added masks could create a apos sense of securityapos and may end up putting people at greater risk. Even with the mouth and nose fully covered, the virus can still enter through the eyes. “People think they are protected when they are not,” he said. “Healthcare workers, in addition to the masks, wear visors too, to protect the eyes.”WHO states that -outbreak\" rel\"nofollow\"studies have found evidence that the use of a medical mask can be beneficial in preventing the spread of infectious droplets from an infected person to someone .The bodyaposs -outbreak\" target\"_blank\" rel\"nofollow\"new report reads: There is limited evidence that wearing a medical mask by healthy iniduals in the households or among contacts of a sick patient, or among attendees of mass gatherings may be beneficial as a preventive measure.However, there is currently no evidence that wearing a maskby healthy persons in the wider community setting, including universal community masking, can prevent them from infection with respiratory viruses, including Covid-.  WHO adds that you should wear a maskyou are coughing and sneezing. It also states that masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. WHOaposs guidelines state:If you wear a mask, then you must know how to use it and dispose of it properly.  Before putting on a mask, clean hands with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water Place the mask carefully, ensuring it covers the mouth and nose, and tie it securely to minimize any gaps between the face and the mask. Avoid touching the mask while wearing it. Remove the mask using the appropriate technique: do not touch the front of the mask but untie it from behind. After removal or whenever a used mask is inadvertently touched, clean hands using an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and waterhands are visibly dirty. Replace masks as soon as they become damp with a new clean, dry mask. Do not re-use single-use masks. Discard single-use masks after each use and dispose of them immediately upon removal.It advises these other measures to prevent contracting coronavirus: Wash your hands frequently Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why  Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.Maintain social distancing Maintain at least  metredistance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why   When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the Covid- virusthe person coughing has the disease.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth Why   Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.Practice respiratory hygiene Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why   Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-.If you have fever, cough and dficulty breathing, seek medical care early Stay homeyou feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and dficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.

The official website of the Wuhan Institute of Virologyshows a recruitment notice looking to hire scientists for research. The job advert was posted on December  last year, seven days before China officially declared an outbreak of Covid-. WIV is located is located just ten miles from  the epicentre of the outbreak in Whuhon. The laboratory, which is said to be the most advanced of its kind in China, listed other similar jobs back in November, including an advert for a researcher to investigate how viral outbreaks “reduce the harm caused by infectious diseases in humans”.  Another ad, listed on November , recruits a scientist to analyse how bats can carry coronavirus without developing a disease.Early confirmed cases of coronavirus from Wuhan were revealed in December, but Chinaaposs first victim may have caught the deadly disease in November, official government data shows. According to the report seen by the South China Morning Post, the first patient to suffer from Covid- was recorded on November .  It was claimed earlier this year that a second lab in the city, thought to belong to WIV, was responsible for the outbreak of the deadly virus. While the Chinese government said the outbreak started inside a wet market in Wuhan, scientists from South China University of Technology in Guangzhou said the possible origin of the virus could be from Wuhan Center for Disease Control . Scholars Botao Xiao and Lei Xiao published a research journal titled aposThe possible origins of -nCoV coronavirusapos on Research Gate, where they claimed WCDC aposhosted animals in laboratories for research purposesapos, including  bats captured in the Hubei and Zhejiang provinces. The report mentioned one researcher, known as JH Tian, aposwas once attacked by batsapos and that aposthe blood of bat was on his skinapos. He then quarantined himself for a total of  days after aposbats peed on himapos. But the theory has been criticised by other experts, who argue the most likely explanation for the outbreak is that bats transferred the virus to another mammal between  and  years ago.

It’s so tough and watching all the elderly patients not seeing their family is so awful.” Emma had been working as a nurse in London but while visiting home the country went into lockdown. The global coronavirus pandemic is not just affecting people’s physical health. The anxiety, stress and uncertainty of it – and the sweeping changes we’re having to make to our lestyles – are also having an impact on people’s mental health too. If it’s making you feel that way, then you’re not alone. It’s quite normal to feel this way in such a dficult and unpredictable situation. Here are some tips and strategies recommended by our BACP members to help you cope with the mental health impacts of the current global situation. Keep a routine Many people are working from home for the first time in their lives, and some will now be juggling a full-time job and home-schooling their children. Plus, there are people whose usual activities have been curtailed by self-isolation. Our member Vasia Toxavidi says keeping a routine can be really important. “Without a routine, negative thinking and anxiety can escalate. I would suggest that people create a day to day plan of things they will need to do e.g. create a morning exercise programme, work from homepossible, cook something dferent, get into an online course.” Think about restricting access to news media and social media Many of our members recommend having a think about how and when you access the news or social media. This may involve choosing news sources you trust – and avoiding social media channels filled with speculation. Stick to the official government guidance and NHS advice websites. Or limit your access to the news to a certain time of the day. “Some people can be quite paralysed by this anxiety and may want to completely stop interacting with the news,” says Elizabeth Turp.  Keep connected with friends and family In our new world of self-isolation and social distancing, we can’t meet up with family and friends like we used to. But keeping connected to them is vital. Melani Halacre recommends “connecting online with friends and talking about other stuff, inventing new fun ways to connect. An online pub quiz among friends...learn a dance routine at home then share it  Play games online  Cook the same recipe in your own home whilst online ” Be present Emma Brand recommends ‘being present.’ “Take a breath and really experience where you are and how you are feeling. To take in your surroundings and thank the space environment and people in your space - to actively be grateful is very powerful,” she says. Practise gratitude Hansa Pankhania also recommends being grateful for what you have, instead of what you do not. And Natasha Page recommends keeping a gratitude diary, where you write down three things you are grateful for every day. She adds: These can be small things such as the sun shining, hearing your child laugh, a home-cooked meal, a cosy bed. Think about what are the things you do have and are grateful for. Try some breathing and relaxation techniques Take a five-second breath in through the nose, hold that breath for five seconds and then breathe out for five seconds. Do this five times, says Catherine Gallacher. Melani Halacre recommends the STAR technique. “Smile, take aand relax...breathing out longer than in to override fight and flight mechanism,” she says. Cate Campbell also recommends trying mindfulness or relaxation apps, and practising deep breathing. Write down your anxieties, and let them go It can help to express this anxiety in a way that you can control. That could be writing down what you feel, or keeping a journal. “Acknowledge that you feel this way. Don’t ignore these feelings,” says Elizabeth Turp. “Allow yourself to worry, put it down in writing in a notebook, and then put that away. Let it go.” Get access to natural light Lockdown may have limited your trips to parks and for countryside walks, but itaposs still important to get access to natural light, says Rakhi Chand. Our exposure to natural light is limited at the moment, and this affects our serotonin and melatonin levels - both vital for our mental health. Rakhi recommends sitting near windows and making home environments as light and airy as possible. If youaposre lucky enough to have a a balcony or garden, use it regularly.  She also says that certain foods - such as walnuts, almonds or bananas - can help boost melatonin, and salmon, eggs and spinach are among the foods that can help boost serotonin. She also says itaposs worth looking into Vitamin D supplements, a light therapy lamp and limiting blue light from phones or screens as it disrupts circadian rhythm. Look after your wellbeing Make sure you are looking after yourself, doing what you can to help get a good night’s sleep, eating well and doing exercise, adds Catherine Gallacher. “I always talk to my clients about a wellbeing check. Sleeping, eating, exercising. If we manage our health like this, it can help make us more robust against anxiety.” Running either on the spot, or outside, releases endorphins and fools the brain and body that they’ve run away from the danger, says Cate Campbell. Use all your senses One of the self-care tips recommended by Eve Menezes Cunningham is to use all your senses to notice where you are. You might want to notice five things you can see right now, five things you can hear right now, says Eve, or any smells or tastes. “These can help us resist the well-worn neural pathways around catastrophising and feeling helpless.” There are more of Eve’s self-care tips available to read here. No expectations, no pressure Sarah Wheatley, who specialises in helping new parents, says that she often discusses with her clients, how “when we live in extraordinary times, all bets are off.” “Since expectations can be one of the things that are dficult to manage as a new parent, when there are no expectations it can be really freeing and allow people time to find their way without any pressure. “The pressure to get back into shape, the pressure to socialise, the pressure to feed certain ways, the pressure to feel calm and relaxed, the pressure to look as though you have it ‘all together’. These pressures are reduced by physical isolation, and can be helpful to some mothers.” Positive thinking At times, this may feel very dficult to do depending on your personal situation. But re-framing a negative situation into a positive one can be very helpful. Indira Chima says: “I believe there are a lot of positives to be gained, which might not be apparent right now. It forces people to slow down and breathe and take stock and that is always a good thing.   “We live at such a fast, frenetic pace and sometimes donapost stop to think about what itaposs all about and where we are heading.  This is forcing us to do that.  And we will grow as a result of this.” Ask for support “It’s not a sign of weakness, but strength to reach out and ask for support,” says Hansa Pankhania “Make a list of everyone you know, friends, family, colleagues, neighbours etc. Now tick  people from this list, who can provide practical, psychological and moral support.  Connect with them and sustain this support circle.” If you would like support from a qualied professional, many counsellors offer online or telephone counselling. They can help you explore and understand what youaposre feeling.

Residents are now allowed to leave the central Chinese city, where the global outbreak began, as the numbers of new cases has steadily decreased. The Chinese government claims the city last month recorded its first week with no new cases. And on Tuesday, China said it had recorded no new daily cases across the entire country. Officially, there have been , recorded cases and , deaths in the Hubei region, which has Wuhan as its capital. Both residents and commentators have questioned those figures, believing they could be much higher. Restrictions which have confined the estimated  million people of Hubei province to their homes, and left them in effective quarantine have started to be slowly relaxed over the past week.  And under new rules that came into force as of midnight on Wednesday local time, people are allowed to enter and leave on the condition they have a ‘green’ code on a mandatory smartphone app. The app is powered by a mix of data-tracking and government surveillance which shows they are healthy and have not been in recent contact with anyone infected. Details of where you were travelling to and why also have to be provided, and those permitted to travel are then issued with a QR code they can scan at travel terminals. The technology has been used in around  Chinese cities to try and control the spread of the virus, but it has been criticised by human rights watchers over privacy concerns. Traffic ed to the streets of the city on Tuesday night while hundreds of people queued for the first trains and flights out.  In the neighbouring province Anhui, thousands of residents flocked to tourist sites over the weekend, after they were invited to attend free of charge. Incredible footage shows tens of thousands queuing shoulder-to-shoulder and back-to-front, with many choosing not to cover their faces.

An audience with Jim Carrey  There’s more chance of Donald Trump buying Lochee United.However, in the s, two of Tinseltown’s favourite sons had Dundonians rolling in the aisles of the city’s crown jewel.The appearances of big screen superstars Bob Hope and Danny Kaye at the Caird Hall would kick-start decades more hilarity at Dundee’s premier venue.From wholesome, family entertainment to the crude and the crass, comedy styles may have changed over the years but the laughter has never stopped.In the first of a three-part series, long-serving Caird Hall manager Susan Gillan looks back at some of the finest comedians to step through the hallowed curtain.Scotland’s traditional theatres were, and still are, the stomping ground for funnymen and women on the iety circuit.Dundee’s former Alhambra, the King’s and the Whitehall would be the port of call for legendary performers like Lex McLean and Stanley Baxter.The Caird Hall offered up a dferent type of atmosphere, the traditional stalls and circles were absent.“Bob Hope said at the time it was the first time he had played a tunnel with seats in it,” Susan said.“I think this was because most venues at that time were typical British-style theatres with the circle and stalls so it did look a bit like that.“You have to remember there were no arenas at that time. These were two of the biggest American comedians of their time.”Hope was one of the world’s best-known comedians and had starred in dozens of hugely successful comedy films, including a series of “Road to” films with Bing Crosby.A renowned singer and dancer as well as a comic, Kaye was catapulted to stardom in the film Up in Arms before playing the title character in The Secret Le of Walter Mitty.Both avid golfers, it is believed the pair were keen on a stint in Dundee so they could tee off on the famed courses at Carnoustie and St Andrews.Musicians took centre stage at the Caird throughout the s but comedians such as Jimmy Tarbuck supported many of the acts.The s would see performances from uber-Welsh comic Max Boyce, armed with his trademark leek, and comedian singer Mike Harding.However, in , the inaugural performance of a shaggy-haired, banjo-strumming weegie would set him on the path to becoming one of the Caird Hall’s most popular stars.Susan added: “The s brought us the one and only Billy Connolly in  with the memorable banana boot tour.“Four shows in two days, sold out in a very short space of time and people loved him.“Throughout every visit you can feel the love in the room for this man, it’s amazing.“Billy#s shows were always a great night, even more as time went on and you had parents bringing their -year-old-plus children to see their hero.”The Big Yin would be a keen visitor to the City of Discovery in the years to come with even more sell-outs, culminating in his  swansong.Susan added: “Billy would always take a stroll around the city in the afternoon before his shows.“He loved the ladies in the hats at Fisher  Donaldson in Whitehall Street and he always went to the Gungha Din on Perth Road for a meal at the end of his show.

It is our experience, thus far, that this country’s handling of the crisis exceeds others in the mitigation of losses for businesses as well as iniduals.“In the coming days we will be implementing elements of the job retention scheme in respect of our staff and it is our intention that all are looked after fully throughout this crisis.“This includes our football players, football staff and administrative staff receiving full pay while they are on furlough for the foreseeable future.”Hello to all of the Dundee fans from all over the globe!  We hope this update finds everyone safe and well during these unprecedented and unimaginable times.  This, I have to say, is the strangest and scariest period, certainly of my letime and it has brought to the forefront, that, despite all of our dferences , we are truly all in this together and as such, we will get through this together.We at Dundee Football Club have been constantly monitoring the situation we find ourselves in due to the COVID- virus and have been taking advice, giving guidance, and implementing protocols to keep our staff, patrons and partners safe and sound as we ensure the sustainability of the club.First of all, the club do indeed have Business Interruption Insurance with specic additions of Notiable Diseases and Prevention of Access to our Commercial Combined Insurance Policy which should allow us to have options to reimburse those losses incurred due to the cancellation of matches. It would be our intention,the season is brought to an early conclusion, where practical, to reimburse those season ticket holders for the remainder of the season that was not played.  This will be further assessed for timelines, etc., as we make our way through the claims process. We have often said that the club is a family and that remains true throughout this situation.In addition to our insurance coverage, we have also sought to access ious sources of support offered by the League, the Association, Government agencies and our associates.  All that have been involved have been extremely helpful in our solidication of the club as a business.  I would like to personally thank John Bennett for his very generous and selfless gesture of suspending rent on the stadium. His call, on day one of this crisis helped to set the tone for all that followed throughout this shutdown and is the epitome of showing how we are all in this together.The UK Government and its agencies have also been extremely helpful in the offering of grants loans and providing relief through the Job Retention Scheme.  That includes HMRC. It is our experience, thus far, that this country’s handling of the crisis exceeds others in the mitigation of losses for businesses as well as iniduals.  In the coming days we will be implementing elements of the job retention scheme in respect of our staff and it is our intention that all are looked after fully throughout this crisis. This includes our football players, football staff and administrative staff receiving full pay while they are on furlough for the foreseeable future.We also think it is right to give credit to the dedicated workers at the SPFL and SFA. They have been working in an ever-changing landscape throughout this unprecedented event. They have continued to keep us informed and provide us advice on how to best navigate this predicament. They have freely shared the advice and guidance they are receiving from the government and UEFA as we all feel our way through these weeks. We continue to take advice and express our opinions on what football should look like when football resumes. Although none of us know yet what will transpire with this season, it is clear that football will be back.We’ve been inundated with requests on how people can help the club.  It’s truly been heart-warming. The one way to helpyou can – and onlyyou can # is to purchase season tickets and merchandise online.  We still have limited availability of this year’s Third Strip, which may become a collector’s item as it may never be worn.This supports the club as well as SSAFA and The Black Watch Association charities.  We will soon be launching our - kit in the upcoming days and we know it’s not enough to completely fill your appetite for football, but keep an eye on the social media sites for Dundee FC and DFC in the Community, which will provide some entertainment while we all do our part to save lives by staying home.We wish we had something more definitive to say, but we hope this brief update will provide some reassurance that we are still here and will remain here when this crisis is over. So from all of us at Dundee Football Club, please stay safe, keep your families safe, that is the most important thing and know that we are all in this together and we will come through this together!"},{"url":null,"title":"george cran coronavirus scottish football dundee united dundee fc","story":"The coronavirus pandemic has hit society with a hammer blow but there is a silver lining to be gleaned from any dark cloud.Le as we knew it has completely changed.My le currently revolves around sitting in my flat coming up with stories to keep football fans entertained during these miserable times, walking my dog and avoiding my we when she tries to get me to do the odd jobs I’ve been putting off for years.I’m sure people reading this will be in a similar boat – day after day, it’s tough to keep going with good cheer.What the situation has given me is a chance to look back and think about all the good times I’ve had since moving to Dundee six years ago.Don’t worry, I’ll not bore you with all the soppy personal stuff but, on the football pitch, there have been some great moments to be witness to.Scottish football is rich with crazy stories on the field – I’m thinking of Wato Kuate totally losing the rag at Tannadice and a rampaging Sofien Moussa picking up two yellow cards in  minutes after coming on as a sub.As much as they were funny looking back, there are a few big wins I covered for both city clubs that stand out to me.Dark Blues might be surprised at my choice for the best performance I’ve seen in recent years.It was February  at Motherwell.Paul Hartley’s team were struggling after losing Greg Stewart, Kane Hemmings and Gary Harkins and that’s why it stands out so much.This was a team without creativity but, a week after beating Rangers, they smashed ’Well - and I can’t remember a better attacking performance I was witness to from a Dundee side.By half-time, a Zak Jules own goal had been added to by two from Marcus Haber and singles from Craig Wighton and Mark O’Hara.Before that game, Dundee’s top scorers in the XI were Haber and Paul McGowan on four which tells you how astonishing it was to see them rip Mark McGhee’s Motherwell to shreds.They would lose the next seven matches and Hartley his job. Looking back, that only makes the win all the more remarkable.For United, it was a far grander venue and harks back to the good old daysof regularly competing for big trophies.The  League Cup semi-final win over Aberdeen was my first experience of covering a big club game at Hampden. It was a great day with a huge Tangerine following rewarded with an amazing comeback victory thanks to Callum Morris and Nadir Ctci headers.Everyone has their own favourites and this stoppage is a great time to reminisce – hopefully, we won’t have to do that for too long.Uefa are due to meet via video conference today to thrash out some sort of plan for sorting how the current season ends.I’m glad to hear that’s because it’s pretty much certain their initial hopes to get club football completed by the end of June won’t be coming to fruition.August seems to be the consensus and it sounds fair enough.What I expect to come out of this virtual get-together is some sort of rational plan to sort out player contracts and technical issues like that.That’s what Uefa is there for. What I don’t expect them to do is grant the SPFL’s wishes by making tough decisions on how to end this season.I can’t help but think Neil Doncasterand SFA chief Ian Maxwellare desperate for Uefa to make a sweeping decision so they can avoid any sort of responsibility when people moan.My gut feeling is the European chiefs will have a plan to get the campaign finished in the autumn and roll straight into the new one. I would dearly love our set-up to be restructured to bigger leagues, however.After watching the  Scottish Cup Final on Sunday it made me think ‘where have all the cup finals gone’ It’s been five long years since Dundee United were last in a major cup final and  for Dundee. The end of my first season at the Tele saw the Tangerines in the Scottish Cup Final and then the League Cup showpiece a year later.It just shows how quickly things can fall apart – thankfully, both seem to be putting the pieces back together.To keep me amused I’ve been watching the Leeds United documentary on Amazon.

Riverside was a shock for them on a December morning and certainly not what a guy like Caniggia was used to!“Caniggia, Ravanelli, Ketsbaia, all the top names that came into the club were brand new. They were great lads, they really were.“It was a bit surreal training against these boys. I was a bit stand-offish because I had a reputation of being a little rash and I wasn’t going to smash Caniggia in training!“He was just left to do his thing and you gave him the respect he deserves.“He basically got to do whatever he wanted around the club. Nobody was going to tell Caniggia he couldn’t do something!“We’d be at training and his five-year-old son would be up with us. We’d be doing a shooting exercise and running out of balls because Caniggia’s son had six at the side kicking them about!”Wilkie also revealed Caniggia’s free reign didn’t stop there and the Argentine was known to enjoy a pre-match cigarette in the Dens Park dressing room.He said: “We had the one cubicle in the changing-room and I used to like my pre-match toilet to just chill out and read the programme to get my mind ready for the game.“I’d always have to wait on Caniggia coming out the toilet because he’d be in there smoking a rolly-up.“He used to just come out with a wee smile on his face, shrug his shoulders and walk past you but that was just the kind of guy he was.“The Italians and the Argentines were horried the British boys would drink beer but they would smoke asit was the healthiest thing going.“They were really fit, though. Caniggia was probably the fittest guy I played with and fans could see that when he scored his first goal against Aberdeen and took his top off.“He was so strong for his age and looked after himself really well.“He was one of the biggest players in the world and it was amazing he was at Dundee.”It was a crucial time in Wilkie’s career but bust-ups with the Bonettis led to him going on loan to Plymouth Argyle, Notts County and Falkirk.But he found his way back to Dens, impressing then-Scotland manager Berti Vogts enough to get a call-up to the national team.“It was dficult for me because I was young and fiery and they were exactly the same,” Wilkie said of clashing with the Bonettis.“I had a couple of fall-outs with them that really came from nothing. It’s disappointing how it ended up because I really quite liked them.“Dario really knew his stuff as a coach and, as an ex-defender, he used to take us away to do bits and pieces in training.“I really enjoyed that. The two times I fell out with them were from silly little things in training that shouldn’t have happened.“My loan moves then came from the fall-outs but I got called back from Falkirk because they’d fallen out with Marco De Marchi and Fan Zhiyi.“When I was on loan at Notts County I’d pretty much given up. I was close to deciding I was done with football because I was fed up.“I was in a bad place.

That goes for the clubs, too.That’s why I’m not surprised both the Dark Blues and the Tangerines have opted to use the government’s furlough scheme – they are businesses and they have to do what is right to ensure they stay afloat during this time when there’s no income.Like a lot of people in the city right now, that will bring a whole lot of worry to workers for what the future holds post-coronavirus.Not knowing where the next wage is coming from is a dreadful situation to be in.There are players at both clubs whose contracts end in a couple of months and they have my every sympathy.I’ve been through similar in my playing career and that uncertainty is probably the worst feeling you can have as a professional.Going through administration at Dundee was a dferent sort of situation but I ended up coming out of it with that question of how I was going to pay my bills.Back then I was prepared to take a wage cut to help the club but it was decided that wouldn’t be enough and I left Dens Park.EXCLUSIVE: Lee Wilkie on starring alongside Claudio Caniggia at Dundee, Argentina star#s unusual pre-match ritual and representing Scotland\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-claudio-caniggia-dundee-fc-scotland embed #

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg.

begun online as Queensberry Properties launched a website inviting feedback on its proposals for Finance House in Edinburgh.The website was launched after a planned second public consultation this month had to be cancelled and gives people a chance to view the plans to turn the former office building into residential accommodation with associated commercial and leisure facilities.And it could be the way people are consulted in the future as more companies look at ways to engage with the public without face-to-face gatherings.The first public stage of planning applications for large developments is lodging a pre-application noticewith a council informing them that public consultation meetings are being held.The meetings, which usually take place in town halls or community centres, give local residents a chance to see the proposals for the first time, talk to developers and give their views.However, that crucial stage is on hold for some developments after the lockdown, which prohibits gatherings of more than two people.At Millerhill, Midlothian, a pre-application notice for housing at Wellington Farm on land known as Dukersquos Field has been lodged with no date or

Almost nobody has been untouched by it, although for some it has been more cataclysmic than others. But we are in this together, and it will be together that we pull through it.One of the real heartbreaking consequences of the lockdown has been the separation of families. Many grandparents now cannot see their grandchildren, or even their own children. Family of people who are ill cannot visit their loved ones. Each story has its own set of circumstances and sadly more is to come before it gets better.While we do need light-heartedness at this time, itrsquos also really important to acknowledge peoplersquos struggles. It was with gut-wrenching despair I realised a number of weeks ago that the arrival of Covid- in Europe was going to seriously affect so many families, my own included.I have five children, but my middle child, who is now  years old, has for the last eight years shared time between Scotland and Sweden.She went to school here until she was seven, when she began to attend school in Sweden. It was then that I had to adjust to the painful reality of less time with her, although I was still able to maintain regular time with her in Scotland and of course keep in daily touch.Itrsquos been an emotional rollercoaster, in which I have stories of me sleeping at airports, travelling through Scandinavian landscape at ungodly hours, and along the way meeting people who have helped and made a real dference. But itrsquos been worth it as it meant our blended family remained connected and my daughter hasnrsquot felt ided between two families but rather a full part of both.We were due to travel to Sweden this Friday andlater, but of course the flights were cancelled a couple of weeks ago. Explaining this to my daughter, and then not being able to say when we would be together was heartbreaking. I felt so helpless, unable to comfort her. Wersquod all counted down the days and now it seems it may be weeks, even months, before any reunion will be possible.I know that there will be families in similar or worse situations. My heart goes out to them all. My initial response to my situation was to close down with despair. The idea of not being with my child, for whom I was the equal main carer until recently, feels unbearable. Some friends have said, with good intentions: ldquoAt least shersquos safe.Yes she is, and I give thanks for that. But any loving parent facing long-term enforced separation from their child will understand the grief that such separation creates. It seeps into your being and makes it dficult to get through the day without having really dark moments. I tried to hide my emotions, but my loving and understanding we knows me too well yet she too felt helpless.There are moments in our lives when we are just overwhelmed by the impossibility of a situation and we just want to curl up and close down. I recently reached that point.Then my daughter asked me while we were talking online: ldquoI wish we could get a magic flying carpet or something dad, or ask the faeries to make a portal. She understood this wasnrsquot possible, but it was the wake-up call I needed. It made me realise I needed to get out of the pit of despair and, for her sake as well as mine, use my creativity to make that magic carpet, and that portal, to help us stay closely connected during this awful time.And the magic ingredient is stories. My daughter has always loved stories, and we have made many up together some of them have even been printed on this page. Now these stories help keep us connected and ease the pain of separation for us both.And so, with the help of technology, and, crucially, a good relationship with her mother, stories have begun to create a vital space for my daughter to be with her Scottish family, even when separated. We can all be together, even my grown-up daughters, who I miss even though they are isolating close by.We storytell to each other, make stories up and even share them in short films. Wee sister Skye, who is six and misses her sister like crazy, holds the tablet which she uses to speak to her, so they can be together while I tell stories and share riddles. We draw and add to the stories together, make fun dramas in which we film ourselves on phones acting out stories like Cinderella, and I have learnt to put wee films together which we can then watch together.Sharing stories like this has given extra meaning to our online communication. It takes us away from just asking ldquohow was your day  or ldquowhat did you do today  questions that often just seem to emphasise our current disconnection. Later, after this crisis is over, the wee films, the artwork and written stories will be memorabilia of this time our evidence that we remained close, even when forced apart.I write about this because I know there are parents and children out there in similarly dficult situations to say you are not alone in this and letrsquos be kind to each other and share the ways we keep ourselves connected. I also know others will have discovered better solutions, as Irsquom no technical wizard.Children are resilient, often more than their grown-ups are, but we need to help them manage this time emotionally, and when we canrsquot give them a hug or be physically with them in hard times, an inheritance of stories they can access can be a real support.I have often been less than enthusiastic about social media in the past, but right now people are discovering in this crisis it has become a leline in many ways.If you, or someone you know, are in a similar situation, please do get in touch. Letrsquos share our experiences, and understand that while we may be isolating, we are not alone."},{"url":null,"title":"european-stone-stacking-championships-dunbar-postponed","story":"The European Stone Stacking Championships were due to take place between April  and , with a place at the World Rock Stacking Championships in Texas next year up for grabs.However, James Craig Page, creator and director of the festival, broke the news that the event, like dozens of others across the county, had to be postponed amid concerns surrounding coronavirus.Mr Page said: ldquoIt has been postponed but we are very hopeful that we will find another venue or be able to go ahead at a dferent time.ldquoHowever, for the time being we have to postpone.This year would have marked the fth year a stone stacking event had taken place in Dunbar event.Each year, it attracts thousands of people to the area, as well as competitors from throughout Europe.Mr Page spoke to the Courier upon ing from the World Rock Stacking Championships in the USA last month.Initially, he was keen to see the European event, which takes place at Eye Cave Beach, off Bayswell Road, take place.However, upon ing to British shores, he became aware of the state of the global issue.Speaking to the Courier, he said: ldquoWe were just waiting for word and advice but it became apparent when I got back how bad things were and that we needed to put it on hold.ldquoWe donrsquot want to be taking any risks with anybodyrsquos health and wellbeing.

In uncertain times and with sweeping powers enacted, democratic accountability demands that the parties outside of government are at the heart of the discussion.ldquoI believe that it is right and proper that the Leader of the Opposition chair this committee, added Mr Carmichael.This week, the House of Commons Commission was told that parliamentary digital, broadcasting and procedural experts were working ldquoround the clock to develop a virtual House of Commons for the end of the Easter recess.The plans would enable MPs to use videoconferencing tools to call in remotely to some parliamentary proceedings, to scrutinise Government during the lockdown.The aim would be for MPs to be able to take part in question times ndash including what would become a virtual Prime Ministerrsquos Questions ndash urgent questions and ministerial statements.Sir Lindsay praised staff for developing e-solutions so quickly, saying: ldquoI am so impressed by the endeavours of our House staff, who have achieved so much in such a short space of time, despite their teams being reduced in numbers by self-isolation and sickness.He added: ldquoI really hope we canto work virtually and safely after the st, subject to the advice of Public Health England.Earlier this month, more than  members signed a letter written by Labours Chi Onwurah, calling for Westminster to go online for the duration of the pandemic.In the letter to John Benger, the Commons Clerk, Ms Onwurah, who represents Newcastle upon Tyne Central, said: \"In a national crisis when  million households are being instructed to stay at home and save lives we must show that we too have got the message.\"A number of parliamentarians, including the Prime Minister, have already been struck down by the virus and it is clear Westminster is not a safe working environment and cannot be made so whilst including a representative number of MPs. We must lead by example.\"Ms Onwurah called for a digital parliament to be created with the help of the technology sector in which all MPs could participate and \"maintain our democratic traditions in accordance with social distancing\".Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons Leader, has made clear the Government is looking at \"every technological solution available\"."},{"url":null,"title":"headline","story":"The Prime Minister is still receiving treatment in St Thomasrsquos Hospital, across the river Thames from Westminster, after his condition rapidly deteriorated, having started showing symptoms of coronavirus infection  days ago.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Mr Johnson while he recovers, described him as ldquoa fighter in his daily address yesterday, while messages of support continued to flood in from across the globe.Mr Raab confirmed that the Prime Minister has not received breathing support from a ventilator, but has continued to get ldquonon-invasive respiratory support in the form of standard oxygen treatment.He said: ldquoIrsquom confident hersquoll pull through becausetherersquos one thing I know about this Prime Minister, hersquos a fighter and hersquoll be back at the helm leading us through this crisis in short order.

But Scotland and England both failed to take these decisions at the right time. In doing so they failed the NHS staff, the carers, the pharmacists, the police and all those on the front line. Catherine Calderwoods description of testing as a \"distraction\" was a bigger error than her holiday home visits but she was certainly not the only one making these decisions and the same was done in England.We can recognise and respect the pressure that those making the strategic decisions are working under, but this should not stop us from asking critical questions and should certainly not stop journalists from probing. Never take for granted that people at the top know what is best.Isobel Lindsay, Biggar.PERHAPS the real conclusion we should draw from Dr Catherine Calderwoodrsquos decision to visit her second home is that she believed that doing so actually proved no real risk to her family or others, provided they observed social distancing once they got there But of course she could not possibly be allowed to say so, and that in offering her official advice she was bowing to the general pressure to react to Covid- asit were the Black Death and not something slightly worse than seasonal flu, which statistically it is.Does the not-travelling rule make senseit is by car  Why should not people be able to access open spaces provided they behave responsibly  Have the risk-averse lunatics finally taken over the asylum  It certainly seems that way.Meanwhile our economy is falling apart, our children are not being educated, and the mental health of us all may be severely challenged.If Dr Calderwood made a mistake, it wasnrsquot going to her Fe holiday home, it was not actually having the courage to match her pronunciations with her actions and not her actions with her pronunciations.Michael Collie, Dunfermline.JILL Stephensonrsquos questioning of the value of the Scottish Governmentignores that Health being managed in Scotland goes back a long way before the present situation, or indeed devolution. Perhaps she might remember the Scottish Home and Health Department. Likewise, the Scottish NHS has historically been separate from the NHS in England since its establishment in . In passing, Professor Hugh Pennington, who she claims has been excluded due to his pro-Union views, is a bacteriologist. Covid-, being a coronavirus, is a virus, so requiring the skills of a virologist. The clue is in the name.But more than these organisational issues, it is arguable that in Scotland the problem of Covid- is dferent from the problem manested in England. For one thing we have fewer areas with a high population density, which are a substantial opportunity for the virus to be passed on to others.Moreover, while I acknowledge problems and shortcomings law is a carer and our son is understandably worried, the fact remains that the death rate in Scotland of those confirmed to have the virus ndash at the time of writing,  of compared to  of  cases . This data is of course suspect ndash itrsquos likely the base number of cases is much higher due to cases never being reported ndash but it does suggest the officials Ms Stephenson is so contemptuous of are doing something right.Peter A Russellin similar mode suggests that because the First Minister did not know the whereabouts of the Chief Medical Officer ndash Dr Calderwood ndash and presumably every other senior official ndash must mean that she has ldquolost operational control. Surely the prime need is for her to be accessible at any time her advice is necessary, which can be achieved by mobile phone without having to inform others of onersquos whereabouts.As others have said in their letters this morning , I agree that Dr Calderwood had to resign. Once might be explained as an errorof judgement, but twice looks like carelessness.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.WHEN Jill Stephenson suggests that most of us prefer to get our information from decision makers in London I suspect that she is well out of touch. I donrsquot want to hear from the CMO and Health Secretary for England.The Scottish Governmentrsquos briefing is about what is actually happening, in some detail. At the most recent briefing I learned about extra funding for community pharmacies, Scottish statistics relating to health and social care, progress with the NHS Louisa Jordan Hospital, how the Care Inspectorate operates and the respective responsibilities in the partnership between the Scottish Government, local authorities and the care homes sector. I also heard the answers to a score or more journalistsrsquo detailed questions, all relating to the response in Scotland.Had I listened to the briefing from London I would have heard none of that.John C Hutchison, Fort William.DOUG Maughanmakes a particularly neat analogy, from an airline pilots perspective, on what should happen to a pilot who acts asthe rules dont apply to them. In mitigation however, what does he think should be the actions of a wartime commander who needs a particularly skilled pilot to carry out a particularly dficult mission  Should they not overlook a stupid indiscretion, at least in the short term We are at war in a very real sense with Covid-, and that was the situation the First Minister found herself in. At least before the further information came to light her initial decision was correct.John Jamieson, Ayr.WHETHER she jumped or was pushed, Catherine Calderwood had to go as Chief Medical Officer, considering that she not only broke the rules which she expected the rest of us to blindly follow, she apparently tried to hide her misdemeanour and continue \"business as usual\" .As for Andy Maciverrsquos argumentthat the First Ministerrsquos initial attempt to keep Dr Calderwood in post in this instance was not a failure of leadership because ldquogood people are hard to find, he is misguided in overlooking the fact that no-one is irreplaceable .On the other hand,Dr Calderwood had unknowingly made some kind of omission, then I would probably find myself entirely agreeing with Mr Maciverhowever, this was not one of those moments. It was the case of someone in high office who blatantly broke the rulesand then tried to cover this up.She had to go.Philip Adams, Crosslee.THE most gted coronavirus communicator in Scotland and indeed the UK is Professor Jason Leitch.Why is he not being used Rev Dr Robert Anderson, Dundonald.AS Dr Calderwood shows that even leading medics can have feet of clay, its essential the general public is aware that the UKs response to the coronavirus outbreak is not based on agreed scientic opinion, but on which group of modellers in a long-running turf war had the ear of the Government.At first a Swedish policy was followed, supported by Oxford University, resisting full lockdown and keeping open schools, businesses and so on. But Imperial College then released highly controversial figures suggesting half a million British deaths, which spread panic in media and political circles.The enormous collateral damage done by lockdown to our economy and all other health areas is clear and we mustto normal. So we need to realise the effectiveness of school closure on the spread of Covid- was always in doubt and demands for continuing lockdown are ideological.Dr John Cameron, St Andrews.YES, Yvonne Dalziel you have missed something when you question the behaviour of elderly folk with underlying health issues ldquostill going out shopping . The answer is likely to be ldquobecause we have no choice.

Thats when you have a sense when thats sustained over a period of time, that you can see it coming out of that.\"Were not there yet and I dont exactly know when we will be. The scientists will tell us that they are constantly modelling the data and theyre constantly looking at those stats.\"We should also remember there is always a lag of a couple of weeks in the hospitalisation and death rate data behind the actions that weve taken to try to slow it down, because thats the nature of the disease,\" he told BBC Breakfast.Meanwhile, Sadiq Khan, the London Mayor, insisted the UK capital, the epicentre of the outbreak, was \"nowhere near\" being able to lt the current lockdown restrictions.He said: \"When the Prime Minister announced the lockdown just over two-and-a-half weeks ago he said he would review it in three weeks time which is this Monday.

They believe this claries what is essential work and ensures that, in the event of construction sites ceasing work, workers’ pay must be protected.The union says it has been pressing the Scottish Government to adopt clearer guidance and tougher measures to ensure firms comply with government instruction and advice in relation to non-essential work, social distancing and personal protective equipment .The new guidance makes clear that work on construction projects should cease unless it is supporting crucial work during the pandemic. Any project deemed essential can also only continue operatingit can comply with guidance on social distancing, safety and welfare during the COVID- outbreak.Essential projects include:Pat Rafferty, Unite Scottish secretary, said: “Unite Scotland has been working tirelessly during this COVID- crisis to ensure that construction workers and the public are protected.#Crucial to this effort has been to get the Scottish Government to give stronger guidance on what constitutes essential and non-essential works. We welcome the new guidance issued which to a far greater degree provides this clarity and that there is a review process in place sofurther measures are needed then they can be adopted swtly.#Importantly from Unite’s perspective, the Scottish Government have also stated that in the event where non-essential construction work ceases then those firms should do all that is humanly possible to make sure the jobs and incomes of those workers is protected.”Unite has also welcomed news today that a furlough agreement has been reached for offshore catering workersShauna Wright, Unite regional industrial officer, said: “Unite Scotland is delighted that all COTA companies in the North Sea have decided to implement the government furlough retention scheme, which we have been campaigning for across all the offshore sector.#The agreement will relieve the fear and anxiety for hundreds of our members providing catering and ancillary services offshore as their jobs are safe and it will also reduce the financial hardship which a redundancy situation would bring at this time.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3063615.jpg--.jpg?1586252028000\n","title":"advice for consumers as major retailer appoints administrators","story":" The news that Debenhams have announced plans to enter administration may have left many of their customers in the Ballymena area who have gt vouchers wondering what their rights are.Debenhams, which has a Ballymena outlet, announced that it will file for administration for the second time in a year.John French, Chief Executive of The Consumer Council said: “At the moment Debenhams is still accepting gt vouchers online but this may change.

There is an obvious social, environmental, and economic cost to this reprehensible activity, that risks polluting our natural environment and waterways.In this context, I strongly support the potential for increased fines on the criminals responsible for dumping illegal waste on our roads and green spaces.

And this year, pregnant women also have to worry about Covid-, a virus that can affect a person’s lungs and airways.Last week, the UK government announced that pregnant women were at an increased risk of severe illness from coronavirus.However, the advice to pregnant women was described by Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty as “a precautionary measure” because “we are early in our understanding of this virus and we want to be sure.”So how does the coronavirus crisis affect youyou are pregnant or have just had a baby This advice was compiled with the help of Dr David Glenn FRCOG, a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at Kingsbridge Private Hospital and Clinical Director for Women and Child Health at Ulster Hospital.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr David Glenn FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr David GlennWhy are pregnant women in the high-risk category Pregnant women do not appear more likely to contract the infection than the general population. Pregnancy itself alters the body’s immune system and response to viral infections in general, which can occasionally be related to more severe symptoms and this will be the same for Covid-.Can a pregnant woman pass coronavirus on to her baby Transmission from mother to baby during the pregnancy or delivery is probable, although the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs, placenta swabs, genital fluid and breastmilk samples from Covid- infected mothers have so far tested negative for the virus. However, a new report describes a case in which the baby born to a Covid- positive mother was found to have antibodies in their blood at birth. This is thought to represent a baby’s response to infection within the womb.Is there a greater chance of miscarriageyou test positive for Covid- There is currently no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or early pregnancy loss in relation to Covid-.Moreover, there is no evidence that the virus damages the baby. Despite recent evidence that the virus can be passed from mother to baby, the proportion of pregnancies affected and the signicance to the baby has yet to be determined.What symptoms should pregnant women be aware of, and what should they dothey are experiencing any of them If you are infected with Covid- you are still most likely to have no symptoms or a mild illness from which you will make a full recovery. Most women will experience only mild or moderate cold flu like symptoms. Cough, fever, shortness of breath, lack of smell taste and even gastrointestinal symptoms are other relevant presentations.For women who have had symptoms, antenatal appointments can be deferred until  days after the start of symptoms, unless symptomspersevere.For women who are self-isolating because someone in their household has possible symptoms of Covid-, appointments should be deferred for  days.If women develop more severe symptoms or her recovery is delayed, this may be a sign that they are developing a more signicant chest infection that requires enhanced care. In this situation you should contact your maternity care team.Are all antenatal appointments going ahead as normal in Northern Ireland If you are well at the moment and have had no complications in your previous pregnancies arrangements for your care may be altered but they are still important to attend.If you have a routine scan or visit due in the coming days, you will still need to attend but the appointment may change due to staffing requirements. Maternity care is essential to reduce complications in mothers and babies. Even in the context of coronavirus, it is important that pregnant women continue to attend their scheduled routine care when they are well.Pregnant women will be asked to keep the number of people with you to a minimum. This will include being asked to attend maternity appointments alone.There may also be a need to reduce the number of routine antenatal visits.If women have an urgent problem related to the pregnancy but not related to coronavirus, they should get in touch using the same emergency contact details they already have. They should not contact that number unless they have an urgent problem.If women have symptoms of coronavirus, they should contact their maternity service and they will arrange the right place and time for the visits. They should not attend a routine clinic.What risks are there of an expectant mother contracting Covid- on a trip to hospital for an antenatal appointment Maternity care is essential and has been developed over many years with improving success to reduce complications in mothers and babies. The risks of not attending care include harm to mother, her baby or both.Many provisions have been put in place to reduce risk to mothers. These include reducing the number of visits to the hospital to a minimum, advice to mothers on reducing the number of people travelling with mothers to the hospital, attending the appointments alone, keeping numbers reduced in waiting rooms, spacing patients in waiting areas, staff taking additional protective efforts to reduce transmission in clinics with hand washing, cleaning equipment etc.How prepared are hospitals to deal with pregnant women with the virus Very signicant changes have been occurring in hospitals over the past weeks to deal with pregnant women with Covid-. Signicant changes have been made in all areas of the hospital, from clinics to wards and including delivery suites. Practice drills are being run frequently to train staff, additional resources have been brought in to help and a huge effort has been made by all levels of non-clinical, clinical, administrative and management staff.If the mother of a baby has symptoms or tests positive for Covid-, should she isolate herself from the baby Given the current limited evidence, we advise that women and healthy infants, not otherwise requiring neonatal care, are kept together in the immediate post-partum period.A risks benefits discussion with neonatologists and families to inidualise care in babies who may be more susceptible is recommended.Can a new mother with the virus breastfeed The main risk of breastfeeding for infants is the close contact with the mother, who is likely to share infective droplets. In the light of the current evidence, it is advised that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk. Precautions should be taken to reduce spread to the baby such as, hand washing before touching the baby, avoiding coughing or sneezing on the baby while feeding, and considering wearing a face mask,available, while feeding or caring for the baby.Can a pregnant person be accompanied by a partner or have visitors A person in labour can be accompanied by one birthing partner, according to the new guidelines. No visitors are permitted in ante-natal or post-natal ward areas.Will babies continue to be delivered in all Northern Ireland hospitals No, not at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine. Antenatal services will continue but it is not possible to deliver babies in the hospital during this surge period.This is due to a lack skilled paediatricians available to provide emergency care to a baby born in distress throughout the  hour period. To protect the wellbeing of mothers and babies, women booked to deliver in Causeway will be contacted and have their delivery transferred to Antrim or Altnagelvin Hospital.Should parents introduce their newborn to friends and family Current government guidance is that you should not meet with people outside your household, so no family celebrations are permitted at present.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She of course refused. She said she wanted to live, he said.The following day pressure was put on her again to sign the DNR. The doctor told her that evenshe disagreed with this, in the end it would be a doctor#s decision, said Mr Grundle.But a spokesperson for the Northern Health Trust said the current circumstances around Covid- mean that doctors have to take all appropriate action, and that the issues around #do not resuscitate# orders will always be sensitive.It has always been considered best practice to have appropriate and realistic discussions with patients and,felt necessary, their next of kin about their wishes for cardiopulmonary resuscitation,this is deemed clinically appropriate, the trust spokesperson said.This should be done in a sensitive and compassionate way and usually happens on admission to hospital.A #do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation#decision should then be documented on the appropriate trust form. The wishes of the patient are always clearly documented in the patient#s notes and will generally be respected.The trust#s policy in relation to this provides guidance for all relevant staff working within the trust regarding the process of making, recording and reviewing DNACPR decisions. We do appreciate that they are very sensitive discussions which can result in upset and even anger for patients and their families. We apologise to this lady and her family for any anxiety caused. Meanwhile, paramedics have asked the Fire Service for support in tackling the coronavirus pandemic. Ambulance chiefs are braced for a wave of cases over the next fortnight which may require the transfer of many patients to hospital. Interim chief fire officer Michael Graham said he was finalising plans, adding that ensuring adequate protective equipment was available was his main priority. We have committed to working with Northern Ireland Ambulance Service colleagues to scope out this work and by the end of this week we should be in a position to communicate what this may look like. He told his staff: I am fully aware that any such support relies on you volunteering for these roles. He also asked members planning to retire within the next six months to consider postponing their arrangements. I know this is a big personal and financial decision for anyone to take but I would ask that you please consideryou could stay with us for another few months to help the organisation.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyPaid-for content PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsAn INM Websitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty"},{"url":null,"title":"mapping the coronavirus spread in northern ireland how many confirmed cases are there in your council area","story":"Authorities in the UK say they aim to ramp up testing FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappAuthorities in the UK say they aim to ramp up testingMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailCases of coronavirus have been rapidly increasing in Northern Ireland, particularly in Belfast.The Public Health Agency is providing regular updates on the number of people who have tested positive since the outbreak started in Northern Ireland.

We need to hang on and continue to adhere as strictly as we can to the current measures.Meanwhile, the Giant’s Causeway is among the National Trust properties which closed to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.Stay at home to prevent the spread of infection. Jeremy LindsayThe PSNI urged people to exercise responsibly.PSNI Superintendent Jeremy Lindsay added: “With warmer weather forecast and the longer, lighter days following the clocks changing, many people will want to get out and about and enjoy the fresh air this weekend so I am urging everyone to continue to follow the health advice stay at home to prevent the spread of infection.”Mr Lindsay added: “The very simple health advice is that you should only leave home when it is absolutely essential and it is encouraging that the vast majority of people do appear to be following the health guidelines.”It has been deemed a reasonable excuse to travel for the purpose of work or to provide voluntary or charitable services where it is not possible to do so from home, police said.It is also a reasonable excuse to travel for essential matters such as seeking medical assistance, obtaining basic necessities including food and medical supplies, providing care or assistance to a vulnerable person, donating blood or attending a funeral of a close family member.The police commander added: “The legislation does not, however, provide that you may travel for the purpose of exercise and therefore, like our colleagues in health, we would advise you not to do this.”The Mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, Sean Bateson, said: “This will be an Easter bank holiday weekend like no other and it’s crucial that we continue to do whatever we can to slow the spread of coronavirus.“Essential travel does not include visits to holiday houses, or caravans. Stay at home, protect yourself, your family, friends, neighbours and the wider community.“Measures around social distancing and travel are in place to keep us safe, but they will only workwe all play our part.”Everyone will be given the opportunity to comply to the regulations. Drew HarrisIn the Republic of Ireland, the government has again pleaded with the public not to go to holiday homes or make unnecessary travel during the Easter holidays.Liz Canavan, assistant secretary general at the Department of the Taoiseach, said: If you do all of the work you put in so far to suppress the virus won#t be enough.The only way to slow the spread is to stay at home.It#s hard but we need to continue what we are doing to protect our lives and those on the front line.Gardai have been given new powers to restrict people#s movements and gatherings for the next five days under emergency legislation.There will be  checkpoints on main roads across the country from Wednesday to discourage people from travelling over Easter.Garda Commissioner Drew Harris saidpeople were currently staying in their holiday homes that was now considered their place of residence and they should not leave during the current restrictions.We want to be proportionate, and provide a graduated response, he said. Everyone will be given the opportunity to comply to the regulations. They may be asked tohome, they may be asked to change their behaviour, whatever that is. But people will be given the opportunity to comply, before we go anywhere near enforcement powers.The penalties for those who flout the regulations include fines of up to €,and up to six months in prison.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dcf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ca-b--af-aedd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dcf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ca-b--af-aedd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dcf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ca-b--af-aedd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dcf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ca-b--af-aedd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dcf .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ca-b--af-aedd_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UKSchool repurposes teaching equipment to make visors for healthcare staffA secondary school has repurposed the machines used to teach students so it can make protective visors for NHS staff.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcdbd-d-f--baaa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcdbd-d-f--baaa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcdbd-d-f--baaa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcdbd-d-f--baaa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dcdbd-d-f--baaa_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UKCall for gardeners to buy online from specialist plant nurseriesGardeners are being urged to shop online with UK independent plant nurseries in the face of cancelled flower shows and shuttered garden centres.Most ReadPictured: Cranes used after lorry overturns near Ballycastle#They should be ashamed#: Police round on paramilitaries issuing threats during coronavirus pandemicMan arrested in Robbie Lawlor Belfast murder probeDean McCullough replaces former DUP councillor Guy Spence following resignationMotorcyclist killed in Dromore crash,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Like a B-rated sci-fi movie, our world is being ravaged by a killer virus which will affect tens of thousands, maybe millions. No-one knows. The experts disagree. Politicians do too, though that’s less of a concern. Worst, there is no certainty of a happy ending, with a superhero with special powers and a shiny suit to sort it all out. In a world where for almost all illnesses, we have effective diagnosis and treatment, and international experience and research to guide management, this Covid  lark is beyond our comprehension.We people who are accustomed to a pill for every ill must readjust to a new set of paradigms. googletag.cmd.push The prospect of arbitrary illness and possible death, without the presence of loved ones at the bedside, and for those of faith, the comfort of the sacraments, is terrying. For families, being unable to have the beautul and peculiarly Irish ritual of farewell, a wake and funeral to grieve and offer thanks, compounds the dread. We know that the young and healthy are likely to come through this, and that it is our elderly who are likely to succumb. Many of the sacrices we make are to protect the vulnerable and those who care for them. But there are no guarantees that any of us is safe. googletag.cmd.push Prince and pauper are vulnerable-tho it’s fair to assume that the prince isn’t coping from a homeless shelter or wracked with worry about how the bills will be paid. As with all human endeavour, there is goodness in abundance. People are delivering hot meals from their own resources to the isolated and vulnerable. Supermarket staff are stocking shelves, scanning tins and packets and smiling through the fear. Council staff empty bins, clean the streets and work from home to keep the wheels of this city turning. Bus drivers, mechanics, what we used to call lorry drivers but are now logistics operatives, all are at their posts, so that we can eat and stay healthy. Mammies and daddies, facing their own worries are reassuring their children that all will be well, putting them over their lessons and trying their best to keep them occupied and safe.So many people who have left work are offering their skills and experience to help in whatever way they can. Machinists skilled from years in Derry’s factories are working at home making masks to protect their neighbours. An incredible , people have volunteered to help the beleaguered NHS. A friend confided regarding her own health worries that she wasn’t concerned so much about herself, but about what might happen her mother with dementia, for whom she cares at home. This is love in action. Our postman came this morning, our usual chat done at two metres distance. We still managed to cover our usual repertoire of politics, weather, health and families, while keeping two metres part. My washing machine packed in. Well I think it’s a vital service, so I rang the man, fully expecting him to tell me to get lost. He told me he would look at it, but wanted to work alone, as his son is immunosuppressed. He came in the back door, I left the money in an envelope, and my clothesline now flutters with clean sheets. I feel especially for our young people, the unique, primal, mad impulsive joy of teenage springtime pulsing in their veins with the first sunny days. They are staying indoors, chatting online, putting in the days, making mad memes for the craic and to keep sane. My niece, doing her Leaving, and with no prospect of exams, is still doing a bit of study, and helping her daddy plant spuds.Her school days ended without the rituals of parties and goodbyes. Even our wee Fionnuala, my four year old grandchild, who lives with us and is the light of our lives in these dark days, knows that school is now at the kitchen table, because of the bad germs which and might make people sick. She washes her hands hourly - and the floor and walls - with enthusiasm and great care. Everywhere, people are doing what they must, often at great personal cost, while struggling with their own worries about work, bills and what the future will bring. They do these things cheerfully and in the best way they can. Superheroes don’t always wear fancy costumes, they are all around us. In these surreal times, we see our old certainties and values exposed as worthless. They seem to have been replaced by an older and more tried and tested value system, less about rights, and more about what is right. Let’s hope that these lessons stick when Covid  is a distant memory.

Slaughtneil, Ballinderry and Craigbane have emerged since , before going on to take provincial honours. There has been a new breed coming knocking at the door in recent years in the form of Glen, Lavey and reigning champions Magherafelt. Over the coming weeks, the County Derry Post will select a series of Derry club teams from the last decade. Up first is Michael McMullan, who delved through the ious players on the club scene to select his team of the decade, from  to .  – Antoacutein McMullan  googletag.cmd.push Began his knock-out championship career with a man of the match performance in the  quarter-final against Glenullin. McMullan was forced to successfully change his kick-out strategy when Mickey Moran introduced a more fluid central spine. Was immense in  against Kilcoo and Kilcar as Slaughtneil won a third Ulster title.  – Oisin Duffy  Despite failing to break into the Derry minor team in his final year, Duffy went on to play at senior level for the county. He was the driving force at the heart of Foreglens drive to two intermediate championship titles and their stint in senior football. At home as a marker or initiating attacks from his role at centre back. googletag.cmd.push  – Dermot McBride  McBride was one of the best man markers in the red and white of Derry during the early part of the decade. In his club colours, he carried on this level of consistency and has played anywhere in the back six – helping them to the  county final. He has defied a series of injuries to extend his playing career to this season.  – Karl McKaigue  The Emmets defender has been one of the main reasons behind Slaughtneils watertight unit. In , he held his direct opponent scoreless in all eight games on their way to the Ulster title. He is not just a maker, he is comfortable on the ball and has often been a receiver of short kick-outs to help his side build from the back.  – Brendan Rogers  Made his name as a full-back, but has excelled anytime he gets let loose on the wing. Ballinascreen tried to pull him out in a county final and he went on the rampage – building attacks. He attacked Ballinderrys Ryan Bell last season and when the Emmets were defeated by Glen, Rogers almost reeled them back in.  – Connor Nevin  Won a championship medal in this first season in  and went on to pick up another three, including an Ulster title as captain five years later. Has played everywhere from full-back to midfield. In recent years, when Ballinderry have been away from the top table, he still puts his shoulder to the wheel. A tough, yet quiet, character.  – Chrissy McKaigue  Made his debut while still in the minor grade, McKaigue spent a brief spell with Sydney Swans at the start of the decade, but ed to be spiritual leader of Slaughtneils golden era. He has played at full-back, but is more at home in the centre where he can dictate the terms of the game. Will regularly get forward to chip in with a score.  – Patsy Bradley  Was his debut as a high-fielding wing-back  years ago, but it was only a matter of time before he became Slaughtneils midfield general. Patsy may lack the height of many other midfielders but certainly made up for it with his salmon-like jump and hang time. It was inspirational and he often popped up when Slaughtneil needed him most.  – Niall Holly  Had he not picked up a nasty shoulder injury at the vital conjuncture against Scotstown, two years ago, Coleraine may well have pushed on an picked up an Ulster title. Can play at full-back but a colossus at midfield and his absence from the county team has been a huge void. Tall, mobile and tough. The perfect midfielder.  – Sean Leo McGoldrick  The number on the jersey is irrelevant for Sean Leo, giving his possession game from wing back to wing forward. He has to be every managers dream. Busy, comfortable on the ball and always takes the right option. When Lavey threatened to stage their late comeback in the  final, it was Sean Leo at the heart of their insurance point.  – Enda Muldoon  Made his senior debut as a goalkeeper in the  McGlinchey Cup. The following season, he spearheaded Ballinderrys attack on their way to his first championship. It was the start of a stellar career of arguably the best club player of his generation. A chief scorer, a target for kick-outs and can pass the ball with effortless accuracy.  – Enda Lynn  Some county players fade away in club football. Enda Lynn is not one of them. Despite being kicked from pillar to post, as Greenloughs talisman, he led the Wee Reds from intermediate football to being seconds away from a senior county final. Handles the ball more than most and is potent as an inside forward.  - Raymond Wilkinson  Crook has played in a number of roles for Ballinderry. His two goals sank Kilrea in the  final and he found the net the following year to break Banaghers resolve in the semi-final. He has played both as busy link man in the half-forward line and inside for Shamrocks. He also made a comeback to play in recent years.  – Mark Lynch  Came to prominence as a  year old, in Derrys last All-Ireland minor win. Was always destined for greatness. Played up front for Banagher and led the line to perfection and his six points almost shot them into the county final. Switched to midfield when they won the intermediate title and last season, they were touching distance from the senior decider.  – Conleith Gilligan  Was Derry minors penalty scoring goalkeeper in . Three years later he led Ballinderry to All-Ireland sevens success as the fly keeper, but came to the fore as the playmaker for their All-Ireland club win. In his later years, he reinvented himself as an inside forward, where he carried their scoring mantle until he eventually retired.

It was hilarious and, as someone put it to me during the week, in the current climate, sports reporters are almost doubling up as the positive part of the media partnership. All sectors of the GAA fraternity were selecting their ious teams. Listing a team comprising from players under assorted conditions. For example, Tomaacutes Brady listed the best Ballymaguigan  players he had ever played with.

Conway steered Ballymaguigan to the  intermediate championship. Of Tomas selection, Gary Coleman and Andrew McCartney were both on Conways list. ONE PLAYER PER CLUB It was where that I got sucked into a GAA debate. I found myself tagged in a tweet by Castledawsongoalkeeper Aidan McLaughlin. During his time with the Derry minors, Aidan was the only one that came to close to selector Noel McFeely, in terms of passion for the Oakleaf jersey. We soon realised on the steps of Casement, when the minor team sat to watch the seniors after our game was over. Chris McCann named a Derry team from the players he had actually saw playing. The one rule- and it was a savage one – it was one player per club. A ridiculous idea, but Aidan challenged Mickey Wilson, Paul McIntyre, Conan Doherty and myself to our selections. I immediately checked in. “This will be handy enough,” I thought. I adopted the same strategy as my former wing man from underage coaching days – Gerry Jokin McEldowney. “Well fill in the strongest spine, and see from there,” he would say. Te first Derry man on my list was easy – Anthony Tohill. In my view, he is the most complete player ever to play the game. He won both throw-ins the day Derry demolished Down in the  opener. He could catch with the best, had the scoring prowess other midfielders didnt come close to and had the athleticism to match his skill. My first problem was, getting Tohill, McGilligan and Fergal Doc into the same team. I took a cop-out by slotting Tohill to wing-forward – where he won a league medal in  – to accommodate the other two. One of them was McGilligan, who was one of the fastest players on the Derry  at the time and a man mountain of a man. Jack Sheedy was still nursing some of his war wounds months later. That brings me to the other. Why have Derry being struggling of late  One main reason has been their inability to final a replacement for Doc and Patsy Bradley. I remember watching the  All-Ireland Quarter-final when the Dubs beat Derry. Big Fergal was immense. When the final whistle sounded, he collapsed to the ground yards away from seat in the front of the Cusack stand. You often hear managers tell players to run until you can run no more and theyll scrape you up and carry you off. That was one of those days and Fergal Doherty was that man. The big loser to the one player per club rule was Bellaghys Damian Cassidy. He was majestic. His performance in the Ulster final in  was always stick out in my memory. In attack, the first name on the list was Paddy Bradley. He has been Derrys best forward of all-time. He had that swagger that all the top forwards need. The Glenullin man had a sweet left foot and developed his right to a level that had defenders guessing. But once he turned onto his left, he didnt need to look at the posts, it always sailed over. For me, what set him apart was his first touch. All aspiring players, should take note – the ball always stuck. Defenders didnt get a second snf. Even last year in a rare appearance against Drumsurn, he still had his touch. PURE PASSION In defence, Tony Scullion was the first man on the team-sheet. Like Bradley, it wasnt because he was the only player from his club in consideration, it was just because he was both brilliant and inspirational. That block he made in the  Ulster final was just one aspect of it. He played football with a smile on his face. If anyone has a bigger passion for the Derry jersey, Id love to see it. There was a video on social media recently from Derrys The men who won Maguire footage. Scud recalls Derrys homecoming and Maghera being bleck with people. His eyes were jumping out of his head as spoke. My mind raced back to an interview I did with him last year. When recalling how he marked Declan Bonner, Scullion jumped out of his armchair and danced around the living room, with his arms out. Its a moment I will never forget. The problem with Chris McCanns rule was how limited it was. Henry Downey versus Johnny McGurk. Paul McFlynn and Johnny McBride. Chrissy McKaigue or Patsy Bradley. Who do you pick from McKeever, McGilligan and Geoffrey McGonigle  There was only one runner for the goalkeeper jersey, so Enda Gormley wasnt going to get a look in either. Thats the beauty of picking teams. “You are all entitled to your opinion, but mine is the only one that matters,” the affable John Rafferty told the Slaughtneil players one night after training. Paul McIntyre and Conan Doherty have also made their selection. Mickey Wilson is a Down man, so we will let him away with it. As for Aidan McLaughlin, you called us out. Its your turn to nail your colours to the mast.

If I lose money on this, I lose money on this.Im not one to shout from the rooftopsbut I am very proud of it and I dont think we could have done a better job.His new album Home was produced byPaul Casey with Johnny McCullough on piano, Liam Bradleyon drums, Paul Cutlfe on whistles, pipes and saxaphone,Nicky Scott on double bass and backing vocals by Lauren Doherty and Liam BradleyGeorgehas been hard at work for the last year- touring the States, supporting Phil Coulter and headlining the Ulster Hall with a  piece choir.My parents were so proud, they just couldnt believe it, he recalls.My first big solo performance was singing Bring Him Home at the Waterside Theatre when I was .My mum was terried and she was saying I cant deal with this, aww thats my wain, he laughs.My dad was the opposite. He just couldnt wait to see me perform and its still the same now.Georges father and namesake is a former Derry City FC player, and his uncle PeterHuttoncaptained the squad for  years.All my uncles

Checkpoints have been set-up at all major routes into the county from Northern Ireland. Motorists are being asked by gardaiacutetheir journey to Donegal was essential. Gardaiacute have been given new powers to restrict peoples movements and gatherings for the next five days under emergency health legislation brought in last month. Speaking at a press conference today, Garda Commissioner Drew Harris said the regulations that have been introduced back up the advice and restrictions provided by the Chief Medical Officer at the Department of Health. googletag.cmd.push He said that gardaiacute will act with the rest of society in making sure that that advice is followed through on. If people see something that is of concern to them, which they think is something where there is a risk of the illness being spread on, a further vector for the illness, then they should let us know so that we can act, arrive there, deal with thesituation and hopefully then resolve it,Commissioner Harris said. Some motorists have been told to turn around and go back in the direction they have came from. Large numbers of people have been reported to be headed to in the direction of Donegal as we head into the Easter weekend, with good weather also being forecasted. googletag.cmd.push Checkpoints have been set up at Bridgend, Muff, Newtowncunningham and Lford. Earlier this week, the Mayor of Inishowen Cllr Martin McDermott urged visitors to stay at home and to not travel to Donegal. Cllr McDermott asked visitors to respect the wishes of local residents.

If people see something that is of concern to them, which they think is something where there is a risk of the illness being spread on, a further vector for the illness, then they should let us know so that we can act, arrive there, deal with thesituation and hopefully then resolve it,Commissioner Harris said.

Behind his boyish grin, he is consuming the fading remnants of county final Sunday. Its all about savouring the scene where unforgettable memories were made. Every last second. In his interview with the County Derry Post, the Rossa forward confesses to not having attended many county finals. They were a dficult watch, like running your eyes over the dream you may never have. Now its real and over the hours and days which follow, Magherafelt would deservedly celebrate like never before. The clubs senior famine was over. googletag.cmd.push Three days later, McElhone would be back in the inner sanctum of a dressing room on final day, this time as a part of Enda Quinns U management team. In the midst of Monday nights celebrations, he had one eye on Lavey. They were going to be a tough assignment, he admitted. Any team with Matthew and Callum Downey on board was going to be a serious proposition. But, theyd give it a lash. When game day arrived, conditions were dficult, but it was Magherafelt who prevailed, adding to their senior, reserve, U , U and U championships. Their U, U and minor leagues were also added, on the back of being the current U champions – before withdrawing to concentrate on preparations for an Ulster clash with Kilcoo. googletag.cmd.push “The negative was, theydidnt get their proper nights sleep the few days before a vital championship game,” states Enda Quinn, who doubles up as the clubs current Youth Officer. They were amidst the celebrations, looking on as their heroes brought home the John McLaughlin Cup. “At the same time, you cant tell them to go home, because you may never see this in your letime again,” said Quinn, who had a son on the U squad. “The positive was that it gives you the ammunition to go again, after seeing what success had done. The show of senior players at thefinal...to a man they were all there. “They were coming down onto the field and they were making heroes out of our Us for winning a championship, it was unbelievable.” Eoin McEvoy and Aaron Murray picked up the Downey cousins. Earlier in the season McEvoy would anchor Ciaran Higgins minor defence from number six. He has a huge future ahead of him. Magherafelt went into the final without the services of Luke McCann who sustained a serious concussion in their drawn semi-final with Dungiven. “He was our full-back, he is a serious player and, last year, was playing on Derry Us,” Quinn added, tipping him for this years Derry minor team. Before a ball was kicked, Magherafelts chief rivals were Bellaghy and Lavey. However, Dungiven turned out to be the secret assassin after making progress during the season. WATERSHED MOMENT “When you saw the quality in the forward line, I wasnt overly surprised at it,” Quinn admits. “The highlight of our season was the replay against Dungiven. We were six points down, a man down, we were without Luke McCann and went on to beat them by six points in extra-time. To me, that was the watershed moment.” At minor level, Magherafelt won the league and pushed eventual Ulster champions Lavey every step of the way in the championship. From that squad, Eoghan Hawe and Johnny McErlain, along with players like Aidan McCluskey and Shea McGuckin - who are still eligible for club minors in  - will stepinto senior football next season. “We had a wide with the last kick and theygot a goal with a minute or two to go and us two points up. It couldve went either way and they went on to win Ulster, so at least you know you are there or thereabouts.”  Derry U champions Above the minor grade, Quinn hailed their U crop that would add to Adrian Cushs senior plans. Some of them had won Ulster minor medals with Derry and helped bring the MacRory Cup to St Marys Magherafelt for the first time. Below, at U level, Magherafelt lost to Dungiven in the Feacuteile final, but ed to clinch the league and championship double. “That was a big achievement there,” said Quinn, who spent countless years with Magherafelt youth teams. After chatting to a handful of Dungiven Gaels, they came to an agreement. Magherafelt were unlucky in the Feacuteile and lucky in the championship. It balanced itself out. Though they had to win the championship without one of the best U players in the county, Cahir Spiers, who was dismissed in their convincing semi-final win over Bellaghy. This seasons Feacuteile has since been cancelled, but Magherafelt wouldve be front runners again after winning the U championship at the tail end of last season and sharing the U AB competition, one for clubs who can field a second team.  Magherafelt won the U ladies championship It was also a year to remember for the clubs U ladies. In , they joined the boys in bringing home All-Ireland Feacuteile. “The girls came through after a really tight ding-duster with Ballinascreen. They have put in savage work and the year before had won the All-Ireland Feacuteile as well as the boys.” LEGACY Their season had a positive impact on all ages of club activity, but it was the manner of their senior football win that will leave the greatest legacy and a winning culture. Enda Quinns thoughts rush back to the start of the story. The championship draw was made on a Thursday night and for the second year in a row, they were pulled out to face the county champions, this time it was Coleraine. “On the Friday night we lost our best player, Michael McEvoy, to a cruciate injury,” Quinn adds. “I dont care what anybody says, your championship draw is everything. When you draw Slaughtneil or Coleraine, it is a downer.” He doesnt buy into needing to beat the best in the first round, it is all about getting a favourable draw. Aside from a comfortable win over Ballinascreen, the Rossa won their other three games by a point “The Coleraine game, they were reasonably in control of it until Emmettscored the goal. The Banagher game,it had went on a another five minutes, they couldve won it.  Magherafelt reserves also won the championship “We were playing champagne football for the first  minutes and going six or seven points up, we looked like we couldve won convincingly. At that stage, I thought wed win this game and really be in a position to compete with whoever came through the other semi-final. “Until we beat a Slaughtneil, Coleraine or Ballinderry, somebody like that, in the championship we werent serious contenders. “We dominated the final and we will be a better team for that. Plus, the fact you have Michael McEvoy back, as well as Peter Quinn and Ryan Ferris coming in.” During his own playing career, Quinn played at corner back up through the ranks before getting to senior. By that point, the spine of his team had drted away. Now, breaking onto the senior team is a dferent proposition. “Our retention of players is excellent at the minute, but it is now a case of how we get them all football that we need to look at.” Every year their senior squad has grown, bit by bit. Quinn looks back to their  All-Ireland Feacuteile winning team. Fergal Duffin, Antone McElhone and Shane Heavron have graduated to senior level, while another - were on the this year’s reserve winning team. “In  a good chunk of that team won a minor championship and were beat in the final at St Pauls. We have won four out of the last six Feacuteile titles.” Quinn still ranks Slaughtneil as the bestteam in Derry and refers to them doing so without a plethora of underage A titles. Beating Coleraine last season should be the beginning of a regular Magherafelt assault on the senior championship and something like  players at the first senior meeting of the season radiates the enthusiasm. Some will drt, but most will stay. “Nearly every one of our senior team has won something at underage, be it a Feacuteile, an U or a minor championship. When you are producing player after player, it gives you a better chance. “Like a lot of clubs, we have put a huge effort into our underage structures over the years and this is now starting to pay off.” Away from the pitch, coronavirus – like in all clubs – has put a stop to all activity. “I know the word is overused, but the buzz around the club was unbelievable . We just hope when the whole thing is back up and running again, that the buzz is still there. It was a fantastic opportunity for us to really push on from there.” Magherafelt had  tickets sold for last Saturdays Champions Dinner, which had to be postponed. It was ignited as a night of celebration for the senior and reserve team. It wasnt like the average gala with tables being sold for outsiders to wine and dine a table of strangers, in a fundraising capacity. It was a Magherafelt night for their own. “This was going to be the biggest ever gathering of Magherafelt people,” Quinn said. Getting a new date is the clubs plan. Its not that easy. When the current pandemic ends, fixtures will take priority, though the club are really determined to hold theat some point during . The recent upgrade of the clubs gym shows the commitment placed in the senior team. There is a thirst for more success. For the underage talent to have their glory days at a packed Celtic Park. “We are in a good place,” Quinn begins to conclude. “ was a fairytale. At the start of the year, you wouldnt dared to dream as high as that, in my opinion. “You have to lap it up and you have to enjoy it. In  you could win nothing and you may not win a senior championship for another  years. Who knows...but youd sincerely hope not. “We are in a good place, from a footballing point of view and from a club point of view this has been a huge gelling experience. You are a town club and it is hard to have the same level of camaraderie because it is so spread and there are so many things going on, but  has done an awful lot for us as a club.” The year was capped off when the Gerry Crossan Memorial Trophy was awarded, as Derry club of the year, at the annual Derry GAA presentationin Tullyglass. Not a single soul in theroom could disagree. It was the icing on the cake. RELATED - The year that changed a club. Click here...

Even in defeat, it was Derry who stole the show. What was supposed to be a Sunday stroll for Offaly turned out to be nothing of the sort as Derry flew the underdog flag with real pride. At the midpoint of the second half, Derry were level and pressing, and it took a strong finish by the overwhelming favourites to earn a six-point cushion at the end. Offaly’s manager, Pat Fleury, readily admitted that his team would have to make enormous improvements before the semi-final against Cork. googletag.cmd.push The truth is, Derry were always in contention in this game despite the dire predictions of a massacre. Geoffrey McGonigle ed from suspension to rattle in two goals and the full forward line of Gary Biggs, Michael Collins and John O’Dwyer scored - among them. There were high-class performances at midfield from Ronan McCloskey and Oliver Collins, and at the back, Derry held both John Troy and Gary Hannfy scoreless. We came down here to win, said manager Kevin McNaughton. We know we are not that far away and I always thought we were in with a chance, we were hurling so well. googletag.cmd.push There was the feeling throughout the first half that Offaly always had the upper hand, but once McGonigle pounced for goals in the final quarter, the complexion of the contest changed. Brian Whelahan had been left out of the starting lineup due to a hamstring strain, but he was quickly pitched into service to shore up a leaky defense, and Joe Errity was also sent into the action. Their presence had the desired effect as Derry managed only two scores in the closing stages, while Offaly had five points and a vital goal by Brendan Murphy. Derry were five points in arrears at the changeover, but they had the advantage of the breeze to come. McGonigle got the first of his goals when he latched on to Kieran McKeever’s probing delivery, and then when Stephen Byrne made a save from John O’Dwyer’s shot, McGonigle was perfectly positioned to dispatch the rebound. We put in a hell of a performance, said Ollie Collins, who was forced out with injury during the second half. This our first time down here. I’m certain this team will be back at this stage of the competition and go better.

The health trust is also enhancing care at home packages for the vulnerable and elderly in the community.Mr Hazzard said the local community will be understandably concerned about the ldquodramatic changes to the hospital and that some may even be angry.ldquoDuring this global health emergency, we must put our faith and support in the expert health practitioners who are best placed to take these decisions, he continued.ldquoI welcome the public commitment from the South Eastern Trust that these are strictly temporary measures to meet the unprecedented challenges represented by the coronavirus pandemic and will not become a permanent reality.Mr Hazzard said that in the days ahead, many queries and issues will arise from the health trustrsquos decision, both from the public and those who work in the health and social care system.He declared: ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to engage with the health trust and other agencies to ensure there is public confidence in this radical approach.ldquoWith this in mind we have written to the Ambulance Service to ask that they urgently reassess their capacity to meet the subsequent needs of our local community on the back of this announcement.Mr Hazzard also appealed to the community to do all in its power to help and assist health and social care workers who find themselves at the frontline in the battle against COVID-.He added: ldquoThey are doing an incredible job in the most challenging of circumstances to keep us all safe. We must demonstrate real social solidarity in order to help and support them in the unprecedented crisis ahead..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 A\u0026E.jpg","title":"A%26E shut in Downe  ","story":"THE Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department has been temporarily closed as part of sweeping changes implemented by health chiefs preparing for the expected surge in coronavirus cases.The department closed on Monday morning with critical care staff and some equipment relocated to the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as part of a radical overhaul of services to cope with the global pandemic.The day procedure unit, outpatients department and minor injuries service at the Downpatrick hospital have also been closed, but the critically important GP out-of-hours service remains operational.Inpatient wards and acute mental heath and psychiatry services for the elderly remain open, as does the hospitalrsquos midwery-led unit, but no births are being allowed to take place for the time being.The South Eastern Trust said that as the organisation prepares ldquofor the biggest challenge it has ever faced it needs to reshape its hospitals and other services on a temporary basis to maximise its ability to ldquomanage the surge in demand for services due to COVID-.While local politicians have reluctantly accepted the closure of several key services at the Downe as part of a reconfiguration plan, they say public and private assurances from senior health trust officials that the changes are temporary must be honoured and all services fully restored when the crisis is over.News of the closure of the Downersquos emergency department and other services came ahead of confirmation that the Downpatrick hospital is one of  locations across the Province which has been designated as a primary care COVID- assessment centre which is expected to open before the end of the week.The new centre mdash designed to help manage the expected increase in coronavirus cases in the community mdash will allow patients who are showing symptoms of the virus to be separated from those with non COVID- conditions.Health chiefs insist that the new service is ldquoessential to ensure that vital GP services can be maintained over the coming weeks and months with minimum disruption.The new centre is not a testing facility and is only there for patients who are unwell and suspected of having the virus and require medical attention. Patients will not be able to report directly to the centre without being referred by their own GP or the Downersquos out-of-hours service.In addition, patients attending the centre will receive appropriate treatment, assessment and,necessary, onward referral to hospital.The new centre is designed to allow GPs and health and social care staff to work together in a suitable clinical environment and to plan what is best for the inidual in terms of treatment and any additional care they need.Defending the decision to close a number of services at the Downe Hospital, the South Eastern Trust says that each of its hospitals and services has a vital role to play in the fight against COVID-.ldquoWe must now make changes to some services in all of our hospitals to prepare for the additional critical care services needed and to achieve the best possible outcomes for our patients, it said in a statement.ldquoWe must deploy our staff and resources to best position us to provide the critical care which will be required for our local populations and to give our staff the essential training they need in order to equip them as much as possible for the challenge ahead.The health trust says that it needs to ensure that its staff can be as prepared as possible to help fight the impact of COVID-.The statement continued: ldquoRetraction of the most acute services from some sites, in a planned manner, is the best way to support our entire patient population and gives our staff the best chance to prepare for and manage the challenges and pressures upon us.ldquoThe Downe Hospital will play a vital role as part of the hospital network in responding to this crisis, particularly through the provision of inpatient services and through working alongside primary care to enable as many patients as possible to be cared for at home.Health chiefs say they believe it is imperative to respond now to provide the local community with the best possible outcomes and also to support staff as best it can.The health trust says it recognises the importance and value of all its sites and services within its communities.The statement adds: ldquoThe Trust would like to assure the community that changes made over the coming weeks and months are solely part of the effort to meet and manage the challenges presented by COVID-, the scale of which we have never faced before.ldquoAll service changes will continue to be reviewed and monitored, with the intention to fully restore services to normal as soon as possible. Every one of us has a role to play in the fight against coronavirus. We urge the public to help us protect themselves and others by staying at home and following all advice.Health chiefs say that with the situation rapidly changing plans must continue to be flexible and have asked for everyonersquos commitment and support ldquoduring these most dficult times..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call on public to tidy up dog mess  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has called on dog owners across the district to clean up after their pets.Rowallane politician Kathryn Owen expressed particular concern about the issue in Saintfield, describing the area between the townrsquos health centre and pharmacy as ldquodisgustingrsquo.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, particularly to children, as the faeces includes roundworm eggs which become infectious after about three weeks and can remain so for up to two years.Just one pile of dog dirt can contain a million roundworm eggs and can lead to stomach upsets, throat infections, asthma and, in some cases, blindness in humans.Given the ongoing battle to contain the deadly coronavirus, Cllr Owen said the last thing needed is a battle against another disease.She said that with many more people at home and likely to remain so for the next few weeks, the number of dog owners taking their pets for a walk will increase.ldquoWe donrsquot have the same level of street cleansing being done at the moment as Newry, Mourne and Down Council is operating with skeleton staff, explained Cllr Owen.ldquoI am appealing to dog owners to take waste bags with them and please clean up after their pets. We are trying to fight onedisease, we donrsquot need to fight another one.Pointing to the disgusting state of the footpath which links the health centre at the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield with a pharmacy in nearby Main Street, Cllr Owen appealed to dog owners to be more considerate ldquoso everyone can enjoy thewelcome breath of fresh air with the pets.Her concern comes two weeks after another Rowallane councillor, Billy Walker, urged the local authority to press ahead with a plan to arm enforcement staff with body cameras in a bid to help address the districtrsquos dog fouling and fly-tipping issues.The move mdash along with using CCTV cameras to help identy offenders mdash is currently being examined by local authority officials.Last year, an enforcement action plan to tackle the dog dirt problem was agreed by the local authority which is also working with the Dogs Trust to promote responsible pet ownership across the district to reduce dog fouling.Cllr Walker said elected representatives have been ldquoinundated with complaints from ratepayers about the dog fouling issue and reaffirmed that he is keen for existing legislation to be strengthened to deal with offenders.He also cautioned against painting all ratepayers with the same brush as there are many who clean up after their pets.ldquoWe clearly need an action plan to deal with issues which are a blight on our district, he declared.ldquoI have consistently called for law breakers to be lsquonamed and shamedrsquo and council officials are seeking legal advice on such a move and any implication doing this would have on data protection legislation, said the Rowallane councillor.He added: ldquoEveryone has a responsibility and a duty of care to make sure they clean up after their pets. Dog dirt is not only unsightly but poses a health risk to young children in particular.ldquoIf people break the law they should be heavily fined and named and shamed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Singer.jpg","title":"Castlewellan singer becomes online sensation  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN grandfather has penned a song in praise of the selfless effort made by NHS workers during the COVID- pandemic.Terry Cowan has become a Facebook sensation during the lockdown with his performances of popular Irish songs.The traditional musician and singer wrote the song, Our Teamrsquos Thatrsquos Dressed in Blue, with one of his daughters very much in mind as shersquos a nurse.So far the ballad has racked up more than , views on social media.Terryrsquos Facebook fame began when he performed several songs on St Patrickrsquos Day ndash and itrsquos been growing ever since.The -year-old businessman says therersquos a growing demand for emigration songs from people who are apart from their sons and daughters.Terry, who runs Financial Directions and Property Directions in his home town, said his new found fame came about due to feeling bored on St Patrickrsquos Day when he was self-isolating at home with his we Patricia.ldquoThis has blown out of all proportion, to be honest, I did not understand the power of social media, said Terry.ldquoI was bored out of my brains on St Patrickrsquos Day and my we, Patricia, suggested that I record a couple of songs on Facebook and thatrsquos what I did. I chose Three Leafed Shamrock and If We Only Had Old Ireland Over Here because they mentioned shamrocks and I got , views in  hours.

I have people who are telling me that they are in tears at forwarding on a song to their son or daughter whorsquos where, added Terry.ldquoIrsquom getting - comments a time, I feel humbled.

All of the centres are monitored by CCTV.While all council meetings have been cancelled, it is understood that the permanent closure decision was taken after talks between council officials and the leaders of the local authorityrsquos main parties.In February, the Recorder revealed that the local authority was considering closing sites in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch on a Sunday, traditionally one of their busiest days of the week, with staff trade union representatives consulted on the issue.It is understood that a number of reasons were cited by local authority officials considering a Sunday closure, including the fact that the other civic amenity sites in Camlough, Crossmaglen, Kilkeel, Newry, Newtownhamilton Warrenpoint and Hilltown already close on Sunday.They were previously under the management of the former Newry and Mourne Council, while civic amenity sites in Down District have always been open on a Sunday.Council officials also revealed recently that they discovered that ratepayers in other parts of the district whose local amenity site is closed on a Sunday were using the sites in Down District.There are also reports of ratepayers in the Ards and North Down Council area using the Downpatrick and Ballynahinch sites on Sundays.The temporary closure of all civic amenity sites comes after it was announced recently that the district is recycling just over  per cent of its waste, passing the Northern Ireland average for the first time. The total amount of waste being recycled locally has increased by five percent.In relation to the recycling centre in Downpatrick, local council officials are working to have mains power connected to the Flying Horse Road.They were forced to hire a generator at a weekly cost to ratepayers of pound to power lights, staff accommodation and some specialised skips and containers which are capable of compacting materials.Council officials are asking ratepayers who have any queries to visit recycling@nmandd.org and they will endeavour to respond to you as quickly as they can..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st April 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar child wants people to have Faith as she offers advice  ","story":"A LITTLE Crossgar girl has become an internet sensation with her public safety plea urging people to fight the coronavirus outbreak.Four year-old Faith McGreevy was captured on video by her mother, Lisa, last week repeating the public health warning to combat COVID-.ldquoYou have to stay in the house for two weeks or maybe  weeks, says Faith in her message. ldquoAnd when you stay in your house and stop going everywhere, like SuperValu, then the bug will go away.Faith, who attends the nursery at Cedar Integrated Primary School, adds thateveryone does what they are told ldquothe bug would go away soon and then we could go everywhere again.Faith says that when she grows up she wants to be a doctor because she likes to make people well again, or maybe a cleaner because she loves helping her mum tidying the house ndash she canrsquot decide yet.Her mum says she has a ldquoterric grasp of current affairs and is never short of an answer.Describing her daughter as being ldquono mug, she said: ldquoWhen me and her dad Robbie wanted to wean her off the dummy we told her she should give it to Santa.ldquoShe agreed saying it was a great idea, but could she have the other dummy that was in the kitchen drawer.Faith seems to be coping well with not being at school over the past few weeks due to the lockdown.Lisa said: ldquoSometimes Faith would ask me why canrsquot she canrsquot play with her friends, but in general she is coping very well with the nursery closure.ldquoIt is a great opportunity to bond more with her little brother, one year-old Eoin.

They say anyone who needs assistance of this kind should contact other agencies.Downpatrick foodbank co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said the organisation regretted the changes it has had to make.When referrals are made, the name of the person, size of their family and address will be logged, alongside other helpful information including locations, post codes and details including the colour of their front door and what local landmarks they may be close to.Mrs Lennon said that the food parcels will be left outside the clientrsquos door and volunteers will not be entering peoplersquos homes.In addition, she confirmed that deliveries will be made every Wednesday and that as food supplies may be limited, the volunteers can only distribute what they have.Under the new guidelines, food donations can only be made at dedicated collection points at the Asda and Supervalu stores in Downpatrick at the Ballydugan retail park and Ballymote shopping centres respectively.Mrs Lennon said donations could no longer be left at Downpatrick Presbyterian Church.She said volunteers continue to be grateful for the support of many people to help needy families at what are challenging times for everyone.Two weeks ago, the foodbank launched a new drive through facility in response to the coronavirus epidemic but has had to abort this to comply with Public Health Agency advice.Volunteers will still be relying on peoplersquos generosity to help them cope with demand in what are unprecedented times and have been pleased with the publicrsquos response to help them continue helping families in need.The foodbank hopes that shoppers will continue to think about the charity when they are shopping and leave items at the dedicated collection points in local stores as they are expecting increasing demand on the service.The Fountain Foodbank contact details are  , email fountainfoodbank@gmail or visit www.downpatrickpresbyterianchurch.org.The Pantry Foodbank in Newcastle has also implemented a home delivery service to ensure the health and safety of volunteers, with all deliveries taking place on Thursday.Further information about Newcastle deliveries is available at   or via the foodbank Facebook page.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

He had been going to this facility since he was a baby.After the restrictions, the nursery had attempted to keep going, offering support to families of key workers. Now, my friend informs me, they are being forced to close.Her voice is cracking with emotion as she tells me that she hopes it will only be for a short period and that everything will be back to normal soon.I agree and wish her all the best, feeling her emotion spill into me. I try, but fail, to think of something useful to say.TUESDAY: I’m worried about my hands. They are delicate items. The fancul part of my mind likes to think this is because they are the tools of an artist. My da likes to tell me it is because I have never done a proper day’s work in all of my le.Now, weeks of vigorous scrubbing has changed them. The skin on my fists has cracked like the ground beneath a puddle in a drought.In desperation I burrow into my we’s bag of lotions and squeeze some unidentied white cream onto my hands. No sooner have I rubbed it in than my paws begin to swell alarmingly.I stumble downstairs, showing my grotesquely oversized mitts to my family. My we exhales in fright. My son laughs.While my we rles through the medicine cabinet for allergy cream my son quickly extemporises a game where I have to run around, pounding my grotesque fists on the floor while shouting ‘Hulk smash!’WEDNESDAY: I look out my front window and I can see soapy water running down the road. I know what is happening. One of my neighbours is washing his car.It is the middle of a weekday and, until recently, he would have been at work at this time. But he doesn’t have a job to go to anymore. Now, he washes his car every day.There is a couple in my estate who had a baby last month. I can see that their family is visiting, standing outside the window while the baby is held up, waving at her through the glass.THURSDAY: I have to do the weekly food shop. After queuing outside the supermarket for half an hour, I am finally admitted.I’m browsing through fruit and veg when a large man wearing with a mask comes running towards me, yelling something indecipherable. I’m frozen in confusion and fear.It turns out that they have introduced a one-way system in the store and I’m walking in the wrong direction, having missed the large arrows stuck on the floor. I turn around.There is a caullower which I had my eye on, but it is behind me now. The large man is still watching and I know I can’t go back. The arrows forbid it.Defeated, I move onwards. I’ll just have Super Noodles instead.FRIDAY: The three of us go for a walk, just to get some exercise. When we meet someone coming along the footpath we stand well out of the way.My we stops to talk to an older woman. They have to raise their voices slightly because they are standing apart.When we resume our stroll I ask my we who it was she was chatting with.‘I don’t know,’ she replies. ‘I just think we should talk to people.’As we walk home we pass the house of an elderly neighbour and notice she has got a brightly coloured piece of paper stuck in her window. It is a drawing my son completed this morning and posted through her letterbox.There is an image of a rainbow. Below it reads: ‘Stay safe, stay happy.’SATURDAY: In an effort to maintain some peer contact for our son, my we has organised for him to take part in FaceTime conversations with his school friends. As I watch him through the door talking into the computer, I’m moved by how much older he seems than his six years.I decide to give him a cuddle, but as soon as I enter the room he shoots me a savage glare.‘Excuse me, can’t you see I’m having a private conversation here.’I meekly retreat.Later, on the phone to his cousin he is overheard.‘You know, when this coronavirus is all over there’s going to be a lot of hugs for everyone....even nana.’In the afternoon I’m listening to the news. Naturally it is dominated by the pandemic. I turn the volume down as my boy enters and sits on my knee. He seems quiet, perhaps a little troubled.I wonder what this world must look like through his juvenile eyes. He knows about the coronavirus pandemic, but how heavily is it weighing on his mind ‘Is there anything,’ I begin, ‘that you want to ask daddy about ’He looks thoughtful for a second. Then he answers.‘Daddy, I’ve noticed that your underpants don’t have pictures of dinosaurs or superheroes on them.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Severe boredom, box of coronas and a few hours later I made The Burn Night Club in Minecraft, because we all know what we secretly miss most.”Chris McConville : User A former pupil at St Patricks Grammar School Armagh, Chris created the stunningly accurate video of the Burn from memory.“I have been a regular at The Burn for what seems like a letime, basically from my th birthday. “In Lurgan, The Burn is almost a rite of passage, and going to school in Armagh meant that at the weekends I could unwind with friends I had not seen in years from primary school and bring my friends from further afield to show them the spectacles Lurgan has to offer. “It definitely holds some great memories for me,” said Chris who studies Business Economics at the University of Ulster. Chris McConville : User “I did most of The Burn by memory, the general layout, the characteristic carpets and places like the outdoor area and cloakroom, but I admit I used some photos I had for small details like lights and paintings etc.as you would expect, a few messy Jager bombs does the memory no good! “I used to play Minecraft years and years ago, probably from the ages of - or so but I slowly went off the game as I was simply growing out of it.”Chris, who currently works in Asda in Portadown, said: “One of my friends I used to go to school with, recently re-created Ma Berry’s Bar in Portadown, as the proud local I am, I could not let Lurgan go unrepresented in this, so I thought “Here’s one for the Lurgan bies”, “I honestly only meant it as a joke between a few friends and I uploaded it on the end of my work break. After about  hours or so of the video being on my Facebook page, I turned on my phone to discover it had absolutely blew up.Chris McConville : User “My Dad went in to work the following day in Interface in Lurgan, and his workmates had seen the video in a Whatsapp group chat. It was insane. “I think my greatest achievement in my le so far has been the shoutout The Burn gave me on their Facebook page, I thinkI won the lottery tomorrow I would still be more excited at the fact that I made The Burn’s Facebook Page.”Chris added: “On a more serious note I think the video actually resonated with a lot of people, ranging from younger people itching to get their social lives back to older people who maybe haven’t been to The Burn in years.“It served as a kind of a throwback of sorts, which was really interesting to see. I’m just glad that some people might have got a bit of a laugh at this, especially during the stressful times we are all going through at the moment.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
