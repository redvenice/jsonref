On his own calculation, he was coining £2,000 a week from pornography — an annual £2.5 million in today\u0027s prices. What he paid to keep the police off his back was a drop in the ocean.From that moment, policeman and pornographer not only socialised and did business together, but watched each other\u0027s backs.When Humphreys had a serious falling-out with Bernie Silver (the randy Humphreys foolishly had a fling with Silver\u0027s girlfriend), it was to Drury he turned to sort out the potentially murderous situation and save him ending up in an unmarked grave in Epping Forest. For this service, he was slipped a massive £1,000 bonus (£25,000 today).         The bent officer in Line Of Duty (cast pictured) communicated with the criminals anonymously and voicelessly via written instructions on a laptop — not over chateaubri and steaks and Beaujolais in a public restaurant, as they did back in the SeventiesThe two even holidayed together with their wives, Humphreys picking up the tab for a lavish two-week spree in a luxury hotel in Cyprus.But it was this that proved their undoing.Back in those days, the police had no anti-corruption unit keeping an eye on wayward conduct among their fellow officers. In the absence of what would now be considered an essential safeguard, that duty fell to the Press, and, in February 1972, the Sunday People exposed that Cyprus holiday under the headline: \u0027The police chief and the Porn King.\u0027While the paper didn\u0027t allege corruption as such (though the implication was clear), it posed a pertinent question: \u0027Was it wise for Commander Drury of the Yard to go on holiday with this old lag?\u0027Out of the blue, everything began to unravel for Ken Drury.The Met launched its own inquiry, while the rest of Fleet Street piled into the commander, who pleaded his innocence in interviews, claiming that he paid his share of the cost of the holiday.But the media could smell blood and it didn\u0027t help his case when further stories appeared of Humphreys being a guest at the Flying Squad\u0027s annual dinner at the Grosvenor House Hotel on Park Lane.The links between the \u0027Heavy Mob\u0027, as the Flying Squad was often known, and the criminal mob were proving too close for anyone\u0027s comfort. In mid-March, Drury was suspended from duty.Brazen as ever, he spoke out loudly and passionately in his own defence. There was no question of improper conduct, he blustered. He announced he had issued a writ for libel against the People, though it never actually appeared.He argued that, yes, he had consorted with criminals, because that was the only way to catch them. \u0027It\u0027s no good going to the vicar\u0027s tea party and trying to get any information about organised teams of robbers,\u0027 he told the BBC in an interview.Coincidentally, it\u0027s the same case made by Superintendent Ted Hastings in TV\u0027s Line Of Duty — that getting close to the villains was the only way of exposing \u0027H\u0027.But how close is too close? When has a line been crossed?In Drury\u0027s case — and those of Virgo, Moody and scores of other officers in the Seventies enjoying ill-gotten gains trickling down through the ranks — the line didn\u0027t even exist. There was no excuse, no question of accidentally overstepping the mark.He knowingly sold himself, and the police service as a whole, down the river.A defiant Drury tried to lie his way out of trouble, telling the police inquiry into his activities that he had \u0027no knowledge whatever of Humphreys being engaged in pornography\u0027. He maintained he kept contact with Humphreys as a source of information — \u0027He tells me anything he considers will be of interest to me\u0027 — and cited a gang of armed robbers he had caught as a result.But his superiors were not taken in. His association with Humphreys was deemed \u0027improper\u0027. It had discredited the reputation of the police. Drury resigned from the force, taking early retirement.In public, though, he maintained a bold front, telling any media outlet that would give him space that all he\u0027d ever done was get close to villains \u0027to keep myself informed. I regarded it as part of my duty as a copper\u0027. He as good as fingered Humphreys as his underworld nark. Humphreys was appalled and angry at being labelled a \u0027grass\u0027 — the worst thing that could be said of any crook.It might even put his life in danger.So he now went on the offensive and, in an interview with the News of The World, laid out in damning detail all his dealings with Drury.Not only had he alone stumped up for that fortnight in Cyprus, he also logged 58 occasions when he wined and dined the police commander and \u0027I always paid the bills\u0027.Drury was being shopped by the very man who\u0027d bought him. He was done for.Everywhere, the corruption seemingly endemic in the force was unravelling.There were more newspaper revelations, this time taking the lid off the Drugs Squad — all of it encouraged by the new broom sweeping through the Met, Commissioner Robert Mark. He was an outsider, untainted by London ways and brought in to clean up the place.\u0027A good police force is one that catches more than criminals than it employs,\u0027 he said as he set up the first dedicated anti-corruption unit at Scotland Yard, A10.Until then, the usual practice had been for the Flying Squad to investigate any allegations about the Dirty Squad, and vice versa.One by one, the villains who thought they had bought themselves immunity were banged up. Humphreys was in prison. So, too, was the vice king Bernie Silver, along with four of his thugs, for living off immoral earnings.Silver is said to have offered a massive bribe of £35,000 — close to £1 million today — to the Serious Crime Squad to get him off the hook, but times had changed.And then it was the turn of the bent coppers themselves to face justice. In dawn raids, Drury and two other Flying Squad officers were arrested, the once all-powerful commander now photographed cowering under a blanket as he was taken into custody.So, too, was Virgo, followed by Moody and seven others from the Dirty Squad.The bulk of the evidence against them came from the pornographers and pimps who, it now turned out, had been paying them off with massive bribes since the early Fifties.A series of sensational trials left the public aghast at what London\u0027s senior law enforcement officers had been up to.The biggest single bung was £14,000 (equivalent to £350,000 today), paid to Moody to have a charge dropped against the manager of a shop.Virgo\u0027s total take over the years was estimated to be £60,000 (£1.5 million today).They used every trick in the book to line their pockets. Police would raid the premises of those who didn\u0027t play ball and confiscate their hoards of dirty magazines.But they didn\u0027t destroy them, as they should have. Instead, the \u0027approved\u0027 pornographers bought them back to sell in their own grubby shops.The judge summed it all up as corruption \u0027on a scale which beggars description\u0027 as he jailed Moody and Virgo for 12 years apiece (though Virgo\u0027s conviction was later quashed on a legal technicality).Drury got eight years, reduced to five on appeal.Not every case came to court. Under Mark\u0027s reign as Met Commissioner, 50 officers were prosecuted, but 478 were allowed to retire early as the systematic corruption that had developed within Scotland Yard was weeded out.But it was not eradicated. Bad apples still exist. If they didn\u0027t, then Line Of Duty would not have had half the nation watching. Crossing the Line of Duty by Neil Root is published by The History Press £16.99 © Neil Root 2019 "},{"url":null,"title":"Competitive canine accidentally competes university 100m race nearly takes victory","story":"Share this article A slow motion replay of footage taken from the finish shows the pooch took third place after losing to a runner in lane 10 and narrowly being pipped by a student in lane two.The dog, which has reportedly lived on the university campus for more than four years, did not seem to faze the other runners nor the crowd as the race was run as normal.          With its sights firmly set on the finish, it bounds past several competitors before charging over the line         A slow motion replay of footage taken from the finish shows the pooch took third place after losing to a runner in lane 10 and narrowly being pipped by a student in lane two"},{"url":null,"title":"Fungus collects particles GOLD discovered Western Australia","story":"Share this article        The fungus was discovered in Boddington, Western Australia (pictured is the Boddington gold mine)Gold is produced at extremely hot temperatures hundreds of kilometres beneath the ground.The CSIRO biologists have observed that the way this fungus produces gold, brings it much closer to the surface.Scientists are excited about the discovery of the fungi and believe it may be a huge benefit for gold miners.\u0027This could be a greener approach to gold mining,\u0027 Saskia Bindschedler, a microbiologist from the University of Neuchatel in Switzerland told the ABC. The fungi is unfortunately too small for the human eye to see and scientists are yet to develop a detection test for the gold growing phenomenon.          Many scientists believe that the fungi will be useful in helping gold miners during digging (file image) Gold-studded fungus discovered in Western Australia could help miners hit pay dirt - Science News - ABC News"},{"url":null,"title":"Bitter sweet victory Verve star Richard Ashcroft thanks Sir Mick Jagger Keith Richards","story":"Share this article Announcing the news at the Ivor Novello awards in London on Thursday night, where he was given the Outstanding Contribution to British Music Award, Ashcroft said the dispute was never about the money but about his need to be credited.He told the crowd: \u0027Thank you so much Keith Richards and Mick Jagger for acknowledging me as the writer of a f***ing masterpiece.

Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3903260.1558708427!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"climate strikes irish students rally across the country","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tImage from the climate protest on Friday, at Merrion Square, Dublin.

Across the world, some 1,400 marches were staged in more than 120 countries – with indications numbers were set to exceed the previous schools strikes for climate global action in early March, when an estimated 1.6 million people took part.The protests in Ireland have been supported by environmental and climate NGOs, and civil society organisations including Siptu, TUI and students’ unions at third level many of their members attended today’s gatherings.The movement is co-ordinated by a number of student groups – notably Schools’ Climate Action Network (SCAN) and Fridays For Future Ireland – who organise and agree climate demands through social media.Since that protest the Government has agreed to one of the demands of the Irish protesters, the declaration of “a national climate and bioersity emergency”. It has also endorsed the recommendations of a landmark report from an all-party Committee on Climate Action, and is about to publish its major response in the form of an all-of-Government plan to tackle climate disruption.SCAN’s other demands included an end to future fossil-fuel extraction reform of the education system to address the need for ecological literacy and embracing active steps to achieve climate justice.The students also called for stronger regulation of “corporations that are causing the climate crisis” and “a transformation to reduce emissions from agriculture in Ireland”.It has reiterated this week its demand for a green new deal that ensures all young people in Ireland “can have livelihoods that don’t damage the Earth” after leaving school."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3903044.1558692632!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"higgins casts ballot as ireland votes in elections and referendum","story":"President Michael D.

The I’ve Voted project will feature small stickers designed by Maser, the artist famed for his Repeal the Eighth mural during the abortion referendum, as well designs by Jacek Matysiak and Jacky Sheridan. Several city centre businesses have agreed to offer discounts to anyone wearing the stickers on Friday, including cocktail bar Pygmalion, vintage clothes shop Nine Crows, and art store Hen’s Teeth.The project is being run by transparency campaigner Liz Carolan, and  columnist Una Mullally, with support from the Dublin Inquirer newspaper, and is funded by the European Parliament information office in Dublin. The stickers will be available at 122 polling stations across the Dublin city area.Campaigners running the pilot project hope that if successful, it could be rolled out on a national basis during the next general election.“We’re encouraging voters to wear their stickers with pride, and post an image on social media, using the hashtag #thistimeimvoting,” Ms Mullally said. “The stickers are not affiliated with any political party, campaign, or movement, but designed to remind people to get to the polls, and express pride in participating in these crucial elections,” she said. The project, which will be pushed on social media on Friday, is hoped to increase traditionally lower voter turnout among young people.“In 2014, turnout for the European Parliament elections was the lowest ever across the European Union. Just 21 per cent of young people in Ireland between the ages of 18 and 24 turned out to vote in 2014,” Ms Mullally said.Voting in the European and local elections, and in the referendum on orce, will take place between 7am and 10pm on Friday.Full results and in depth analysis of the local elections"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.2548236.1456428434!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why it pays to vote all the way down the ballot paper","story":"We have the PRSTV system in Ireland.  A complex system where the voter has more influence over candidates than almost any other country in Europe.  But how exactly does it work? Hugh Linehan Reports\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFine Gael won a 10 per cent seat bonus at the last general election – in other words ten per cent more seats than their vote warranted in percentage terms. Photograph: PAWe were discussing a particularly obnoxious candidate. Call him “Murphy”.My wife assured us that her’s was the best approach – she would use her usual method , casting Murphy as her last preference, No. 15 on a 15-candidate ballot paper, and working her way up from the bottom.Our friend demurred. He would not dream of putting any preference beside Murphy’s name, however lowly, for fear that his vote would somehow creep, transfer by transfer, eventually into the latter’s pile and assist his election.Though our friend was difficult to persuade, the trust is that my wife is right: anything higher than a 15, and particularly a failure to use all his preferences, could theoretically help Murphy, however slightly.I will return to why that should be. But the message is crucial: under our almost unique voting system, the Single Transferable Vote (STV) – Malta, the Australian Senate, and the Northern Ireland Assembly share it – it pays to vote all the way down the list to maximise the effectiveness of one’s ballot for and against inidual candidates.Simple as 1,2,3STV has the key virtue of being simple to use as a voter, as simple as 1,2,3, although counting is another matter. And reading the entrails of the results involves yet other levels of complexity and sublety for political operators and psephologists. When results are dug-down-into, they show patterns of party and regional differences, of local disputes, of generational change, of ideological sympathies and alliances.As a voting system, STV inspires peculiar devotion – twice the politicians tried unsuccessfully to abolish it – and not least because of the extended horse-race character of the counts whose compulsive theatricality more than any technical objections did for automated voting.Its feature of allowing voters themselves to rank candidates within the same party places a particular emphasis on the inidual and encourages intra-party rivalry, parochial ‘favour’ politics, and perhaps even the proliferation of independents and small parties that we are seeing today.To read the entrails it is necessary first to understand the ‘quota’, the number of votes in any constituency necessary for one person to be elected or, to put it another way, the number of votes which, multiplied by the seats to be filled, would allow only that number of seats to be filled.In a three-seater where 100 people vote, four people can achieve 25 votes each – (25 x 4  100) – whereas only three can achieve 26 votes each – (26+ 26+26+22  100).This produces a formula for the quota that applies to any number of seats: Quota  (1003+1 ) +1 26 Or  Total Valid Vote (Seats+1) +1Quotas for three-seat, four-seat and five-seat constituencies work out in percentage terms at 26, 21, and 17 per cent respectively.To analyse results at national level, or in a constituency after the first count, a rough rule of thumb that will provide a prediction of the eventual outcome is to tally the number of quotas or parts of quotas that each party achieves and to add to them an assessment of how much they can expect to pick up in transfers from parties or iniduals who will be eliminated.But transfer rates are incredibly difficult to predict – particulary so in this election – and at national level resulting predictions from percentage shares of vote have become increasingly impossible. In not a single constituency is the last seat, in many cases even the last two seats, predictable.Far from proportionalKnown to one and all as “proportional representation”, in truth the STV is far from that. As David Farrell and Richard Katz point out in a recent academic article, modern STV elections are only “reasonably proportional” in allocating seats in terms of parties’ share of the poll at local and national level . “In a technical sense it is a misnomer to identify STV as a proportional system at all.”Parties can work to improve the efficiency of their vote by maximising the rate at which their candidates and allies transfer between them. A formal coalition deal may help – Labour, for example, delivered 71 per cent of its transferred votes to Fine Gael in 1973, as opposed to only 32 per cent in 1969.And parties can also help that process by spreading their first preference votes between their candidates to minimise the extent to which they are transferred as reduced surpluses rather than as eliminations. In a system which encourages internal party competition this is by no means easy. (Surpluses arise when a candidate goes over a quota - hisher spare votes are redistributed at a reduced level, while the transfers from eliminated candidates are whole votes).Fine Gael won a 10 per cent seat bonus at the last general election – in other words ten per cent more seats than their vote warranted in percentage terms. This time round, if anything, the result is likely to stray even further from the strictly proportional.Constituency seatsFor one thing, there are more three-seaters and four-seaters – the larger the number of seats in a constituency the more proportional the result is likely to be.For another, the poll findings of huge support for independents and the smaller parties – more than 40 per cent in Dublin in the latest  IpsosMRBI poll – would seem to reflect a somewhat disengaged voter attitude to candidates, particularly to those from the main parties. That suggests a likely higher than normal reluctance to vote down through the ballot paper once initial preferences are recorded.Inidually, it is true, failing to vote right down through the list has only a marginal effect. But if this sin of omission is repeated on a widespread basis by fellow voters it can actually assist a candidate who you would prefer to see defeated by lowering the effective quota, and making it easier for himher to reach it. As an election proceeds and the number of non-transferable votes accumulates, the number required to be elected – the effective quota – falls.In an election in which there is a strong non-transferable trend, this marginal trend can become very pronounced and results become very unpredictable.As my wife would insist – “vote all the way through the list”.Full profiles and in depth analysis of the European election"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3903081.1558697599!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may s legacy final message of compromise comes too late","story":"British prime minister Theresa May has announced that she will leave her office, three years after succeeding David Cameron.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Theresa May at the end of her address at Downing Street. She said she was standing down as Conservative leader “with no ill-will, but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love.” Photograph: Toby MelvilleReutersTheresa May’s resignation statement will be remembered for the distress she showed at the end of it, a rare display of raw feeling from this most reserved of politicians. Her voice began to tremble as she said she would soon be leaving the job it had been “the honour of my life to hold”. She seemed to recover with a quick smile as she spoke about being Britain’s second female prime minister but a few seconds later as she summed up her feelings about resigning, she could no longer hold back her tears.“I do so with no ill-will, but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love,” she said.If May truly has no ill-will against the men who drove her from office, she is a woman of heroic forbearance. But at the heart of her statement this morning was a message for her successor that there is no alternative to seeking a consensus at Westminster over Brexit.“Such a consensus can only be reached if those on all sides of the debate are willing to compromise,” she said.Her warning might carry more authority if she had not shied away from the path of compromise on Brexit for so long. Elected Conservative leader by acclamation in 2016 after Andrea Leadsom withdrew from the contest, May could have pursued a form of Brexit that reflected the narrow margin of victory in the referendum.Instead, she told her party conference in October that year that she would trigger article 50 within six months and laid down the red lines that have haunted the negotiations ever since. She restated them in her Lancaster House speech the following January, promising that Britain would leave the single market, the customs union and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.Election disasterShe threw away her party’s Commons majority by calling an unnecessary general election in 2017, May had an opportunity to change course. But she persisted with a strategy of seeking a Brexit deal that could win a majority on the basis of Conservative and DUP votes alone.By the time she started talking to Labour earlier this year it was too late, her own authority had been worn down to nothing and nobody at Westminster believed she could deliver any compromise that was agreed.May spoke in her statement about the need for compromise in restoring the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland and she came to understand the danger Brexit posed to the constitutional settlement there. As a unionist, she feared that a no-deal Brexit would increase support for a Border poll that could eventually see Northern Ireland leave the United Kingdom. And the murder of Lyra McKee last month brought home to her the danger of a wider return to violence.May’s successor will almost certainly seek to renegotiate the Northern Ireland backstop, probably promising to leave the EU without a deal on October 31st rather than accept the withdrawal agreement as it stands. In her statement this morning, May said nothing about seeking further concessions from Brussels, pointing her successor towards where the solution to the Brexit impasse lies, at Westminster.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

She would remain as prime minister until a new leader is elected, probably by the end of July. Photograph: Getty ImagesNewspapers on Thursday published a blurred image of an apparently tearful Theresa May in a car, mimicking the picture of Margaret Thatcher weeping as she left Downing Street in 1990. But the end of May’s premiership has little in common with that of Thatcher, who had been a hugely successful Conservative leader with significant political accomplishments – for better or worse.May’s political demise is a little closer to that of Gordon Brown, who also lasted three dispiriting years as prime minister and was slow to leave after the 2010 election.“Squatter holed up in Number 10,” was the Sun’s headline two days after that election, when Brown was still trying to form a government will smaller parties before David Cameron and Nick Clegg agreed a coalition between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.Anthony Eden resigned in 1957 on doctor’s orders but the decline of his premiership shared much with May’s, as his political authority seeped away in full view on the floor of the House of Commons. Like May’s, Eden’s fall played out to the sound of his cabinet ministers scuttling away from the scene of the crime – in his case the Suez crisis, in hers the Brexit deal.Downing Street said the prime minister was listening to ministers’ concerns about the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) on Thursday after her government announced that the Bill would not now be published on Friday. But there is no realistic prospect of even a heavily revised version of the Bill coming to a vote under May’s leadership. Second referendumRemoving the most controversial concession to the Opposition – a vote for MPs on whether to have a second referendum – would diminish further the Bill’s chances of attracting Labour votes. And ministers with ambitions to succeed May could not support the Bill while it still includes the other big concession – a vote on staying in a customs union with the EU.The prime minister is expected to announce on Friday that she will resign as Conservative leader when MPs return from the Whitsun recess in early June. She would remain as prime minister until a new leader is elected, probably by the end of July.Her successor is likely to promise to seek changes to the withdrawal agreement so that it includes a guarantee that the Northern Ireland backstop will be time-limited and that Britain cannot be trapped within it indefinitely. The new prime minister’s opening bid to the EU could be something like the Malthouse Compromise or the Brady amendment, which call for the backstop to be replaced by alternative arrangements to keep the Border open.May’s successor is also likely to rule out seeking a further article 50 extension beyond October 31st and to promise to leave the EU without a deal rather than accept an unchanged withdrawal agreement. A new research paper from the Institute for Government, Whitehall’s favourite think tank, says it will be difficult for MPs to stop a no-deal Brexit.Parliament’s most successful attempt to avoid no deal this year was Yvette Cooper’s amendment to a “meaningful vote” on the Brexit deal that allowed MPs to take control of the timetable and introduce legislation without the government’s consent.“But if a new prime minister is set on no deal, then they have no need for further ‘meaningful votes’.\u0026nbspThat denies MPs an opportunity to vote to take control of the timetable again,” the paper says. ‘Near impossible task’“It looks like\u0026nbspa near impossible task for MPs to stop a prime minister who is determined to leave the EU without a deal. Parliamentary procedure offers no route\u0026nbspand the only apparent way\u0026nbspto blocking no\u0026nbspdeal – a vote of no confidence – would be a massive gamble for Tory MPs.”At a UK in a Changing Europe conference this week, Strathclyde University’s John Curtice predicted that MPs would pass a motion of no confidence in the government rather than allow a no-deal Brexit in October. He said any prime minister who pushed for no-deal Brexit would see their government collapse in the autumn and risk a general election with a good chance of producing a Labour-led government. Labour is unlikely to win a majority, so it would depend on the Scottish National Party or the Liberal Democrats for support, making legislating to leave the EU impossible.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Simon DawsonTheresa May will resign the leadership of Britain’s Conservative Party on Friday, June 7th and will remain prime minister until her successor is chosen, she announced on Friday morning. Mrs May’s voice broke as she said it had been the “honour of my life” to “serve the country I love”.Speaking outside 10 Downing Street in London, she said she had been Britain’s second woman prime minister, “but certainly not the last”, and she bore no ill-will to her political opponents. She said she believed she had been right to persevere in her efforts to pass the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. However, it was s now clear to her that it was in the best interests of the country for a new prime minister to take charge, she said. “I will resign as leader on Friday, 7th June, so a successor can be chosen.”Mrs May will therefore still be prime minister when US president Donald Trump makes his state visit to the UK at the start of June.Mrs May’s government postponed Friday’s planned publication of the Bill after ministers told her they could not support it.Reacting to Mrs May’s announcement, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said Mrs May had striven to chart a new future for Britain and he looked forward to working with her successor.“I got to know Theresa May very well over the last two years. She is principled, honourable and deeply passionate about doing her best for her country, and her party,” Mr Varadkar said.“Politicians throughout the EU have admired her tenacity, her courage and her determination during what has been a difficult and challenging time.“Theresa May strove to chart a new future for the United Kingdom. I want to wish her the very best for the future. And I look forward to working closely with her successor.”Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said Mrs May understood Ireland’s “vulnerabilities” and the UK’s “responsibilities” . He said that was why she signed off on the Withdrawal Agreement, which he believed was a sensible compromise for everybody. “And it’s why she was a strong defender of the need for the backstop as an insurance mechanism, as a fallback position, as a temporary arrangement while permanent arrangements can be discussed and agreed, should the backstop ever be needed,” Mr Coveney said.“And that logic and those issues aren’t going to go away just because you have a new British prime minister who may have said things that counter or undermine Theresa May’s position in the past.”Meanwhile, DUP leader Arlene Foster, whose party has been propping up the Conservative Party in Westminster, also paid tribute.“After the General Election in June 2017, we worked with the prime minister and her team through the Confidence and Supply Agreement. Whilst at times there were differences in our approach, particularly on Brexit, we enjoyed a respectful and courteous relationship,” Ms Foster said.“In particular, I commend and thank the prime minister for her dutiful approach on national issues and her willingness to recognise Northern Ireland’s need for additional resources through Confidence and Supply arrangements. “I pay tribute to her selfless service in the interests of the United Kingdom and wish her well for the future.”After a premiership of almost three years, Mrs May met Graham Brady, chairman of the powerful Conservative 1922 Committee, on Friday morning to set out a timetable for her departure.The committee’s executive held a secret ballot this week on changing party rules to allow an immediate confidence vote in the prime minister if she refuses to leave, but Sir Graham was keeping the ballots sealed until Friday’s meeting.Mrs May, once a reluctant supporter of EU membership, won the top job in the turmoil that followed the 2016 Brexit vote, and is to step down with her central pledges – to lead the United Kingdom out of the European Union and heal its isions – unfulfilled.She endured repeated crises and humiliation in her effort to find a compromise Brexit deal that parliament could ratify. British politics remains deadlocked over how, when or whether to leave the EU.The treasurer of the 1922 Committee, Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, previously said he expected Mrs May would stay on as a caretaker prime minister while a successor was chosen.“It would be much tidier if she stays on as caretaker while we go through our processes of electing a leader of the Conservative Party who will then eventually take over as prime minister,” Sir Geoffrey told the BBC before Mrs May’s announcement.A leadership election is thought likely to last about six weeks, starting on June 10th, after US president Donald Trump’s state visit to Britain.Mrs May’s departure will deepen the Brexit crisis as a new leader is likely to want a more decisive split, raising the chances of a confrontation with the EU and a snap parliamentary election.Mr Juncker “liked her and appreciated working with her” and “very much respected” Mrs May, who he was reported as saying was “a very courageous woman”. He would continue to remain in touch and was ready to talk to whoever succeeds her as prime minister.The spokeswoman said the EU’s position on the non-negotiability of the Withdrawal Agreement remained, and the working assumption of the union remains that the UK will depart before October 31st. The commission, she said, has completed extensive “preparedness” planning – for a no-deal departure – and she refused to be drawn on a suggestion that the UK might now need to ask for another extension.Brexit-related developments will now form part of the leaders’ dinner discussion scheduled for Tuesday, which Mrs May is expected to attend. The meeting had been planned to discuss the outcome of the European Parliament elections and specifically how to deal with the appointment of Mr Juncker’s successor as head of the Commission.The leading contenders to succeed Mrs May all want a tougher orce deal, although the EU has said it will not renegotiate the Withdrawal Treaty it sealed in November.Boris Johnson, the face of the official Brexit campaign in 2016, is the favourite to succeed May. Betting markets put a 40 per cent chance of Mr Johnson winning the top job in the event that a contest takes place.Others tipped by betting markets are Dominic Raab, a Brexit supporter and former Brexit secretary. Betting markets put him on a 14 per cent chance.Environment Secretary Michael Gove, former House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt each have a 7 per cent chance, according to betting markets.Betting markets give Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt and International Development Secretary Rory Stewart each a 4 per cent chance of the top job while Home Secretary (interior minister) Sajid Javid has a 3 per cent chance.–Additional reporting: ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Here are the runners and riders for the Tory leadership.Boris JohnsonThe out-and-out favourite, so popular with the Tory grassroots – polling for the Times showed he is the first choice of 39 per cent of them, with Dominic Raab trailing next on 13 per cent – that it would be hard for MPs to not make him one of the final two. He has been relatively quiet recently, beyond his regular  column, but this is very deliberate.Dominic RaabFew things say “would-be leader in waiting” like a kitchen photoshoot with your spouse, and the former Brexit secretary duly obliged with this image awash with tasteful pastel hues.Among the more core constituency of Tory MPs, Raab has been pushing hard, as has his semi-official “Ready for Raab” Twitter feed.Jeremy HuntThe fears that the foreign secretary would be another overly woolly compromise choice – “Theresa in trousers” to use the critics’ phrase – were hardly assuaged when after a set-piece speech he seemed unable to outline why his brand of Conservatism might appeal to voters.Michael GoveThe environment secretary has not done anything specific to merit his place in the decliners list, but that is perhaps the point – he has not done very much at all to cement his place in the hearts of Tory MPs.Robust Brexiters in particular dislike the fact he has stayed loyal even in the final days of the crumbling May regime.Andrea LeadsomThe Commons leader, who left Theresa May as the last candidate standing when she pulled out of the last leadership race in 2016, is still considering another tilt at the top job.But even with her staunch Brexiter tendencies she would be seen as an outsider.Sajid JavidThe home secretary still has the same weaknesses: he is an uninspiring speaker and some worry he is too fond of headline-grabbing, illiberal political gestures.But he is almost as ubiquitous as Truss, and clearly believes this is his time.He even has a grassrootsastroturf Twitter feed - “Avid4Javid”.Matt HancockThe health secretary remains a relative outsider, but the longer the race goes on the more he gains ground for the seemingly basic virtues of being apparently competent and broadly similar to a normal human being, albeit a particularly energetic one.A concerted effort would probably require an image consultant.Penny MordauntPreviously seen as a definite outsider, her promotion from international development secretary to defence after the sacking of Gavin Williamson has significantly bolstered her position.As both a confirmed Brexiter and a social liberal she could unite different camps, but she remains relatively untested.Rory StewartThe cabinet’s most recent arrival – Mordaunt’s promotion to defence saw Stewart made international development secretary – certainly has the necessary ambition and self-belief, plus a privileged-if-unorthodox backstory covering Eton, Oxford, a senior role in post-war Iraq and a bestselling book about walking across Afghanistan. He remains an outsider, not least because of his remain tendencies and slightly 2010 view of compassionate Conservatism.Esther McVeyThe former work and pensions secretary, who quit last year over May’s Brexit plans, has launched her own in-party campaign groupleadership vehicle called Blue Collar Conservatism, promising to make the party more amenable to voters in deprived communities – mainly through a promise to deliver a strong Brexit, and policies such as erting much of the foreign aid budget to schools and police.Liz TrussAs much for effort as inspiration. The chief secretary to the Treasury has been almost everywhere the last few weeks – including modelling some slightly alarming trousers in the Mail on Sunday – to explain her free market, libertarian philosophy.Everyone knows what she thinks, but this will still perhaps not be enough.Amber RuddThe front-person for a new group of self-declared “one nation” Conservatives, Rudd’s remainer tendencies and slender majority in her Hastings constituency makes her an outsider, and there is speculation she might be mainly seeking to curb the Brexit-y tendencies of Boris Johnson.James BrokenshireA not entirely serious place in the list for the housing and communities secretary, who insists he is not standing, for the achievement of gaining unexpected prominence simply through owning four ovens.Leadership bids have been made and lost on less.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

By 2000 this figure dropped to almost 28,000.The country has now seen no new infections since 2013 and is the first nation in WHO Africa region to be declared malaria-free in more than 40 years – only  Mauritius, which achieved the goal in 1973, has also eliminated the disease in the region. “Algeria is where the malaria parasite was first discovered in humans almost a century and a half ago, and that was a significant milestone in responding to the disease,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti WHO regional director for Africa.“Now Algeria has shown the rest of Africa that malaria can be beaten through country leadership, bold action, sound investment and science. The rest of the continent can learn from this experience,” she said. War on malaria | On the brink of a breakthrough?Algeria\u0027s success has been due to a combination of free malaria diagnosis and treatment and a well-trained health workforce. Similar factors have helped Argentina eradicate the parasitic disease – the second country in South America to do so following Paraguay last year. “Argentina reported the last indigenous case in 2010 and has demonstrated the commitment, the capacity within its health, laboratory and surveillance systems, and the necessary financing to prevent the re-establishment of malaria within the country”, said Dr Carissa F. Etienne, director of the WHO Pan American Health Organization.“I am sure that Argentina will serve as an inspiration and as an example for other countries of the Americas to achieve the elimination of malaria in the coming years,” she added. India and Rwanda have made huge progress in tackling malariaAccording to the 2018 World Malaria Report, China is also close to eradicating the disease and Rwanda, Ethiopia and Pakistan have reduced infection levels. The countries are a highlights in an otherwise gloomy global picture. The countries with the highest disease burden are all moving backwards, including Nigeria, DRC, Mozambique and Uganda.“The news that Algeria and Argentina have been declared malaria free is a remarkable achievement for both countries,” said Dr Abdourahmane Diallo, CEO of the RBM Partnership to End Malaria.“As well as saving precious lives and strengthening health systems, malaria-free status provides external economic benefits for these countries enabling them to free up resources to address other health and development priorities and improve worker productivity and school attendance.“Other countries now have two more nations that serve as examples of how elimination can be achieved,” Dr Diallo added.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security EU warns Boris Johnson and Tory leadership rivals: nothing has changed on BrexitNext Prime Minister odds: Latest polls on the Conservative Party leadership electionConservative leadership election: What happens next for the Tory party, and how is the next leader and Prime Minister selected?European elections 2019: When do we find out the results of yesterday\u0026#39s vote? \u0026#39Difficult if not impossible\u0026#39 to check safety of NHS screening programmes amid litany of failings, expert warnsKilling of \u0026#39most wanted\u0026#39 al-Qaeda linked Kashmir militant sparks protestComment: I\u0026#39m sorry Mrs May, but compromise is a dirty word when it involves the betrayal of BrexitTheresa May confirms she will resign as leader of the Conservative Party on June 7 - latest newsComment: Theresa May, the unwanted PM, failed because she didn\u0026#39t understand how to governTwo children dead and four others in hospital following major incident in Sheffield Theresa May\u0026#39s resignation speech in full: Prime Minister tearful as she declares she will quit on June 7Brazil\u0026#39s supreme court votes to make homophobia and transphobia crimes Dead Dog in a Suitcase (and Other Love Songs) review: Kneehigh turn The Beggar\u0026#39s Opera into an uproarious Punch and Judy showRuth Davidson calls on next prime minister to show \u0026#39resolute\u0026#39 commitment to the UnionThree more climbers die amid Everest \u0026#39traffic jam\u0026#39Belgian brothers resume beer brewing after more than two centuriesComment: Farewell, Theresa May - a compromise Prime Minister in a post-compromise world We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expenses podcast lone campaigner took whole parliament","story":"Journalist and freedom of information campaigner, Heather BrookeTucked away in the back of New Labour’s 1997 manifesto is a promise.

If you look back in time to see when our forecast skill was roughly 30 per cent less than it was today, it\u0027s somewhere around 1980, Mr Jacobs said.EE confirms plans to launch 5G for UK customers this monthThis would result in the reduction of hurricane track forecasts\u0027 lead time by roughly two to three days.In 2018, there were more than 170 deaths during the Atlantic hurricane season, according to figures from the National Hurricane Center.The year before was even more devastating, with the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season resulting in over 3,350 deaths, as a result of major storms like Harvey, Irma and Maria.Without early warning systems, the World Meteorological Organisation said this figure would have been even higher.The death toll of the largest hurricanes were certainly reduced because we saw them coming, wrote Mary Power, a director at WMO, in the organisation\u0027s review of the hurricane season.Forecasting models accurately predicted the hurricane path and anticipated their extreme intensities days ahead. This allowed territories in the region to declare a state of emergency up to two days in advance of landfall.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Scunthorpe was built around steel, not the other way round.\u0027Click to followThe IndependentDevastated workers protested on Thursday, urging the government to nationalise British Steel or urgently find a buyer. Former workers at the stricken company’s\u0026nbspScunthorpe plant said that closure would ruin a town built around the steel industry for a century and a half.\u0026nbspScunthorpe MP\u0026nbspNic\u0026nbspDakin\u0026nbspwarned Britain could be “held to ransom” by other steel producing nations if one of the UK’s few remaining major steel plants were to close.British Steel’s Scunthorpe\u0026nbspsite faces being shut down permanently unless new investment can be found after the company went into compulsory liquidation.Charlotte Childs worked at the plant for 11 years after leaving school aged 16 to start an electrical engineering apprenticeship before being made redundant in 2015.The steel works has provided skilled jobs for generations, she says. Her grandparents and great grandparents worked there and her cousin is now doing a British Steel apprenticeship.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmers“My story is not unique,” she says. “Steel has been central to the area for 150 years it’s steeped in history. Scunthorpe was built around steel, not the other way round.”Closing the steelworks would take out a huge amount of wages from the economy. The average steel worker makes £36,000, well above average for the region and the UK as a whole. It would double the local unemployment rate in the region, even before any jobs are inevitably lost in the supply chain.But the impact goes beyond that.\u0026nbspHundreds of local businesses rely on steel indirectly.“My brother has a car garage across the road from the steelworks,” says Ms Childs, who is now a representative for the GMB union.“Most of his customers\u0026nbspwork for British Steel or its contractors. Where is his income going to come from?“There are loads of businesses that are there purposely because of British Steel, like the cafe where the workers can go for a cheeky butty on their break.”Scunthorpe MP Nic Dakin is determined to find a resolution that allows workers to keep their jobs. Closure would cause strategic damage to the UK, he said.“This is not just about the core of 4,500 workers that would lose their jobs and not just about those in and around Scunthorpe.“In the blast furnaces at Scunthorpe we are talking about a national strategic asset. To lose that would damage the supply of steel to key industries like defence.“The steel industry is the foundation of manufacturing in this country and vitally important for our economy.”After the UK’s last steelworks closure at\u0026nbspRedcar in 2015, the UK now has just two active blast furnaces – Scunthorpe and Port Talbot in South Wales. They provide some of the highest quality steel in the world.“Once you lose that capability you can’t make your own steel. Are we serious about being a modern, independent nation?” asks Dakin.Such concerns are particularly pertinent at a time of growing nationalism in trade policy with Donald Trump pushing up US tariff barriers and China responding in kind.\u0026nbsp“We would have to import from overseas, where production might be less carbon friendly, the impact on the environment and air quality is higher“You can be held to ransom if you need to import to build important national assets: your railways, ships, planes and whatever else.Ms Childs agrees that the UK will be left in a vulnerable position. “If the Tories abandon manufacturing in the UK, as they seem to be doing, China will one day finish flooding the market with cheap steel and realise that there’s no competition left.”Another thing that\u0026nbspirks is that despite pledges to support steel as part of its industrial strategy, the government undermined it in one important way.When EU steel tariffs were proposed after China began dumping steel onto markets, pushing down prices,\u0026nbspBritain led efforts not to introduce tariffs that would have protected British steel.“It’s fine for the government to talk about an industrial strategy, but what does that actually mean?”Anna Soubry came to visit when steel was facing its last crisis in 2015.“I couldn’t tell you one tangible thing that they did after that.”While many people might want to blame Brexit for the closure, the government must look at its own record, says Ms Childs.“Once the Brexit shambles is over there will still be the same problems and issues that were there before.”British businesses pay twice as much for energy as their French counterparts while business rates are five to 10\u0026nbsptimes as high as on the continent.The experience of Redcar, points to what could befall Scunthorpe if the British Steel plant were allowed to close. Average weekly wages have gone from being some of the highest in the region to amongst the lowest since the steelworks shut.“Redcar knows only too well the cost of a closed steelworks and the impact it has on families, on communities, and on the local economy,” says MP Anna Turley.“Former steelworkers still contact my office needing support.”\u0026nbspBritish Steel’s Scunthorpe site – which is as big as a town in itself – also poses big, and expensive, problems for the environment.Steelworks can leave behind a toxic legacy which presents dangers to the public. Following a plant closure in Corby, Northamptonshire, 19 children were born with deformed feet and hands after their mothers inhaled toxic particles while pregnant during the Eighties\u0026nbspand Nineties.In Redcar, many more millions need to be spent to make the site safe and ready to become productive again.“It’s costing millions every month, and has been for three and a half years, just to keep the site safe,” says Anna Turley.\u0026nbsp“That is before any real clean up work has begun.“The cost of closure is astronomical, especially in comparison to much smaller sums needed to protect the assets, keep them running, and give the business and workforce a future.”The cost of environmental clean-up in Scunthorpe would be “at least” in the hundreds of millions of pounds and would take years, says local MP Nic Dakin – a huge bill that would be footed by taxpayers.“While its operating and it’s safe it’s all an asset but once it stops operating there are some dangerous things there,” he says.Some critics have said that market forces must be allowed to run their course and that the industry is in terminal decline -\u0026nbsp186,000 were employed in UK steel in 1981 compared to just 32,000 last year. Yorkshire and the Humber has already been the worst hit region with 40,000 jobs gone.But there this simplistic story of decline is misleading. Despite little support from the government, the average steel worker has become roughly five times more productive than they were in 1970 a significantly bigger improvement than in the economy as a whole.Given the UK’s current dire level of productivity growth, jettisoning some of the country’s most skilled workers would raise some serious questions.Now that the company has gone into liquidation there are three main options: find a buyer, nationalise or close it down.\u0026nbspThe public broadly supports nationalisation, with 48 per cent of people believing British Steel should be taken back into public ownership compared to just 18 per cent thinking the opposite, according to a new YouGov poll.It reveals that, even among Tory voters, 41 per cent think British Steel should be nationalised compared to 30 per cent who don’t.Nationalisation is the last thing that would have helped British SteelThis leaves a tricky decision for business secretary Greg Clark. Nationalisation of key assets such as the energy and rail networks has been a high-profile element of Labour’s policy platform -\u0026nbsp and one that some Tories have ridiculed.\u0026nbspTo take the British Steel into public ownership could easily be seen as a capitulation or at least an admission that Labour has a point. But to do otherwise could appear heartless. It would also be criticised as\u0026nbspa failure of the government’s industrial strategy, part of which was supposed to be a sector deal to support the steel industry.Clark has said that there are interested private-sector parties but Ms Childs is wary that an “unscrupulous” owner may enter the fray.“We don’t want a buyer that wants to take certain bits of the steel works and discard the rest or charge extortionate rates of interest.\u0026nbsp“We want someone who will take the whole thing and make steel in Scunthorpe for the foreseeable future.”“One thing is for sure” she says. “Through the financial crisis, the 2015 steel crisis and this current crisis, the men and women that work at that plant have always turned up, worked hard and delivered the best steel they can.\u0026nbsp“They will never stop doing that. Unless the gates close for good.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Dean Turner, UK economist as UBS Wealth Management, forecast that the pound could crash to as low as 1.15 against the dollar and close to parity against the euro in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He warned investors not to be complacent about the prospect.“Despite mounting public impatience over the process, many top officials and lawmakers remain fearful of the economic damage from a no-deal exit,” said Mr Turner.“Lingering uncertainty would likely cause firms to delay investment, and keep sterling under downward pressure.”“A UK decision to remain an EU member would likely cause a swift rebound in sterling, which we believe is undervalued relative to its purchasing power parity level of around USD 1.58.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On 19 August, a temporary license granted to Huawei by the US government will expire.Users will also lose\u0026nbspthe ability to install future versions of the Android operating system.“Huawei will continue to provide security updates and after sales services to all existing Huawei and Honor smartphone and tablet products covering those have been sold or still in stock globally,” a Huawei spokesperson told\u0026nbspThe Independent.“We will continue to build a\u0026nbspsafe and sustainable software ecosystem, in order to provide the best experience for all users globally.”But this will not be the case for future versions of Huawei smartphones, which will lose access to popular Google apps like Maps and YouTube.The suspension will also mean owners of new Huawei phones will not be able to download any apps using the Google Play store.Huawei\u0026nbspsays it has been preparing for this eventuality by building its own technology that is not reliant on US tech giants.Chief executive Richard Yu said in an interview last year that it has a backup plan should it ever be cut off from the likes of Google and Microsoft.Google issues message to Huawei phone owners“We have prepared our own operating system,” he told German publication\u0026nbspDie Welt. “Should it ever happen that we can no longer use these systems, we would be prepared.That’s our plan B but of course we prefer to work with the ecosystems of Google and Microsoft.”After the Trump administration placed Huawei on its “entity list” last week, Huawei executive Ren\u0026nbspZhengfei\u0026nbspreiterated this in comments to Japanese media.“We have already been preparing for this,” he said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However,\u0026nbspcannibalism remains a central fascination for the author. As\u0026nbspMM Owen declares,\u0026nbspthe universe is forever dining on itself, but figures such as\u0026nbspClarice Starling and Cari Mora want to interrupt the mealClick to followThe IndependentA ghost at the cannibal feast: Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) in 1991’s ‘The Silence of the Lambs’, which won five OscarsIn his “perfectly natural history” of cannibalism, the zoologist Bill Schutt takes until page one to reference Hannibal Lecter eating a census-taker’s liver with some fava beans and a big Amarone. Lecter might be literature’s most famous serial killer he is without doubt its most famous cannibal. Lecter’s creator, Thomas Harris, recently published Cari Mora – his first novel in 13 years, and his first in 44 years not to feature the character made famous by an unblinking, enunciating Anthony Hopkins. And yet: despite Lecter’s absence in Cari Mora, the cannibalism persists. We meet Mr\u0026nbspImran, “a large, impassive man with a cauliflower ear”. A character recalls that Imran is “a biter”, and “could not always help it”. At the end of the chapter, sat in his car, Imran eats a human kidney, raw.Lecter is absent, and yet here he lingers, a ghost at the cannibal feast. Why? Why can’t Harris help but include a glimpse of this dark appetite? Because at the core of Harris’s hugely popular horror fiction has always been a vision of the cosmos as fundamentally self-devouring. As Schutt outlines, cannibalism occurs across “the entire animal kingdom”.It is common among\u0026nbspinvertebrates, fish, and reptiles, and it is observable in many mammals, including our closest cousins, chimpanzees. Such cannibalism generally occurs for reasons “that make perfect sense from an evolutionary standpoint: reducing competition, as a component of sexual behaviour, or an aspect of parental care.” (On parental care: if you want nightmares, go and google how the mother black lace-weaver spider feeds her young.)In the figure of Lecter, though, Harris elevated cannibalism into a sort of commentary, or performance, that reflects the real nature of reality. It is the essence of violence, but it is also simply predation in all its forms, including the sexual. Lecter embodied this greedy spirit, and Harris can’t shake his famous\u0026nbspvillain in Cari Mora, his shadow is everywhere. Lecter’s devouring of Clarice Starling’s spirit at the end of Hannibal is even given a rerun, suggesting that perhaps Harris regretted this final, polarising act of character consumption.Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) comes face to face with ‘a godless epicureanism’ (Rex)Cari Mora, Harris’s new novel, has two plots. Firstly, there is a battle between two criminal outfits to recover $25m worth of gold. This gold is locked inside a booby-trapped safe buried beneath an opulent waterfront mansion in Miami’s Biscayne Bay. Secondly, there is a far more familiar Harris motif: violent psychopath pursues attractive young woman. The leader of one of the gold-hunting gangs, Hans-Peter Schneider, has a day job that involves kidnapping such women, mutilating them, and selling them to a super-wealthy Mauritanian man with depraved sexual tastes. The Colombian-born Cari Mora, a former child soldier conscripted into Farc at the age of 11, is caretaker at the Escobar house. Hans-Peter’s pursuit of her runs until the novel’s penultimate page.These two dramas – the race to acquire Escobar’s gold, and Hans-Peter’s violent designs on Cari – don’t entirely hang together. Though Cari Mora is composed in Harris’s usual style – precise and wintry, occasionally oracular – most of the major players in the gold-digging story are too thinly drawn to ever become truly interesting, and a couple of backstories with the seeds of subplots wither away. Where the two stories connect, though, is in linking and mirroring different sorts of biological appetite.There is no mercy we make mercy, manufacture it in the parts that have overgrown our basic reptile brain. There is no murder. We make murder, and it matters only to usIn 2005, the journal Gothic Studies declared that “Thomas Harris is to contemporary Gothic fiction what Bram Stoker was to Gothic fiction in the 19th century.” They certainly resemble in each other in one way: both of their famous characters are men who like to dine on human flesh, and whose act of dining symbolises far more than satiating caloric need. Taken as a whole, Cari Mora reiterates Harris’s master metaphor: an unending, cosmic cannibalism.Everything Harris has ever written is filled with the goings-on of other species. Often, these goings-on are predatory, studded with insights into how a given creature does violence. (In Hannibal, we learn that “tusked pigs instinctively disembowel when fighting the upright species, men and bears.”) Throughout Cari Mora, animals are a constant. Barely a page goes by without a frog peeping, a bird whistling, a manatee surfacing, a firefly winking, a stingray flapping. Above all, Cari Mora is filled with birds: “ibisses, egrets, pelicans, ospreys, herons”. And as in the rest of Harris’s novels, the narrative is studded with glimpses of predation. Fish swallow insects ants are drawn to the protein of dried blood. We see pelicans “heading for a fish drive,” “crows mobbing a hawk,” two cormorants stalking some mullet.At one point, a character in Cari Mora stands at the seawall of the Escobar house and watches a school of crevalle jacks chase some mullet until there are “pieces of fish flying in the air”. “Like us,” he thinks “Kill and gobble like us.” Later, at an assisted-living facility, a “preacher of advanced age” holds a Bible and reads to his congregation from the Book of Ecclesiastes: “... men might see that they themselves are beasts ... For that which befalleth the sons of man befalleth beasts as the one dieth, so dieth the other yes, they have alone breath all are of the dust and all turn to dust again.” The preacher’s congregation are gathered in the garden, and the faithful are comprised of one elderly human, “four dogs, a cat, a small goat, a free parrot and several chickens”. Harris occasionally peels back his thematic curtain a little too much, and these two moments, taken together, are a good example. Cari Mora says it very clearly: humans are animals. Creatures like all the rest. And as the novel never lets us forget, what creatures do above all else is kill and gobble. This demolishing of human exceptionalism, reminder of the brute biosphere, recalls the end of Red Dragon, when Will Graham\u0026nbsprecalls a visit he took to Shiloh, Western Tennessee – site of a bloody 1862 American Civil War battle. Graham muses that Shiloh reflects “the indifference of nature ... there is no mercy we make mercy, manufacture it in the parts that have overgrown our basic reptile brain. There is no murder. We make murder, and it matters only to us.”Mictlantecuhtli and ritualistic cannibalism in prehiic Mesoamerica in the ‘Codex Magliabechiano’The American author Thomas Ligotti has argued that all modern horror writing – from Ann Radcliffe through Edgar Allan Poe through HP\u0026nbspLovecraft – is inspired by a biologically derived pessimism. Call it the disillusionment of Darwin. Effective horror is always, in Ligotti’s view, motivated by the capacity “not only to place humanity outside the centre of the Creation but also to survey the universe itself as centreless and our species as only a smudge of organic materials at the mercy of forces that know us not”. Ligotti’s thesis is absolutely true of Harris. (“We are elaborations of carbon,” Lecter tells Clarice, in a letter.) Continuing the framing of all of the Hannibal novels, in Cari Mora, we observe evolution’s ravenous menagerie, and a perpetual, ambient feeding frenzy. Like any creature, humans are essentially consumable, and thus potential prey. In Hannibal, Mason Verger wants to kill Lecter by feeding him to wild pigs, and is killed when a sister stuffs a moray eel down his throat. In Cari Mora, saltwater crocodiles dine on men, and more than one corpse is gnawed by crabs. In a flashback of Cari stumbling upon a corpse in the Colombian jungle, we see “buzzards flapping away, heavy from their meal”. The murderous Hans-Peter recalls revisiting a woman he dumped in the bush and finding her “warmed wonderfully – warmed warmer than life by the larval mounds.”William Blake, that great chronicler of innocence, is a constant touchpoint with Harris. It is innocence, and its cousin, frailty, that is always under threat, and always protected by his heroesSuch cross-species feasting functions as a sort of metaphorical ontology. If there is no bright line between species, then everything is cannibalism, and nothing is cannibalism. Meanwhile, the meal is never-ending. This has always been the ouroboros at the heart of Harris’s gothic horror: reality’s true condition is simply matter, devouring itself. All of it driven by the pure force of the senses and what they crave. That there is a dark sort of elegance to this is partly what made Lecter unique the original genius of him wasn’t that he was amoral, but that he replaced morality with aesthetics, with pleasure – and that it charmed. Hannibal was an unreal representation of his type in Hunting Humans, the serial murder expert Elliott Leyton writes that real serial killers are “usually without intellectual or physical attainments” “they are often uneducated and virtually illiterate” “their tastes are anything but elegant” “in sum, they are dull, unimaginative, socially defective, vengeful, self-absorbed and self-pitying human beings”. Lecter is the perfect inverse of all this. But it works, because fiction’s entire function is to tell the truth even as it lies. What Lecter represents is not real psychological profile but a worldview that is at once cruel and rather pretty. Lecter embodies a godless epicureanism, the elevation of the Goldberg Variations above human life. This is, in truth, the natural end of aesthetics. “Taste and smell are housed in parts of the mind that precede pity,” he explains to Clarice Starling, while sipping lillet with a slice of orange.In Red Dragon, the protagonist mentions what is today semi-common knowledge but what was then a fresh insight from FBI psychological profiling: “sadism to animals as a child” is a common precursor to violent psychopathy. By contrast – and in opposition to the cosmic cascade of imploding appetites that power his fictional universe – the virtuous characters in Harris’s fiction always care about animals. The standout example is Clarice Starling and her lambs. Starling’s drive to rescue murder victims is presented as a sort of existential quest, a need to insert at least brief spells of silence into her memory of lambs screaming on their way to the slaughter. William Blake, that great chronicler of innocence, is a constant touchpoint with Harris. It is innocence, and its cousin, frailty, that is always under threat, and always protected by his heroes. In Hannibal, Barney, another of Harris’s good guys, protects a wounded pigeon. In Cari Mora, Cari works part-time at the Pelican Harbour Seabird Station helping rehabilitate birds nursing injuries that will kill them in the wild. At one point, in an echo of Starling with her little lamb, Cari jumps off a boat and wades into some mangroves to rescue an osprey tangled in some fishing wire.13th century Hereford Mappa Mundi (ullstein bild via Getty)A pitiless cosmos, devouring itself a will to protect the weak, the about-to-be-devoured, whatever species they belong to. This old dualism of Harris’s – psychopathic killer and determined FBI agent order and chaos – provides the core tension in Cari Mora. It drives the encounter between Hans-Peter and Cari, which is not only the most memorable thing in the book, but clearly the section in which Harris was most interested. (The gold-digging plot wraps up rather abruptly, and the last three chapters focus entirely on Hans-Peter hunting Cari.) While Cari struggles to repair the wings of hurt birds, Hans-Peter dreams of reducing her to “a stump with a single branchy limb” “with which to provide pleasure to her masters”. She is blind compassion he is fastidious sadism.When they aren’t eating, the thing animals are most interested in is mating. And in the Harris cosmos – which is almost entirely absent of men and women having normal, healthy, edifying sex – erotic craving is another part of the feeding, just hunger felt in a different set of organs. At its most benign, this is an ambient, helpless lust that leaves people (mainly men) bitter and envious. At its worst, it is Harris’s serial killers, who feed their debased erotic fantasies with the flesh of women. An eroticised predation is present again in Cari Mora, with Hans-Peter’s pursuit of Cari. (The condition of men not raping women, meanwhile, is labelled “civilisation.”) It seems bold of Harris to have conjured another violent-psychopath-pursues attractive-young-woman setup. It is inevitable that this one will be compared to his famous original, the Lecter-Starling (or Hopkins-Foster) saga. The safer thing, surely, would have been to find a different sort of horror plot. What is he doing here? Why revisit this setup?This is a sort of manic, infantile madness one could never imagine with Lecter, who is so preternaturally composed that his pulse rate doesn’t rise when he’s biting a nurse’s tongue offA clue, I posit, lies in Cari Mora’s blurb: “Monsters lurk in the crevices between male desire and female survival. No other writer in the last century has conjured those monsters with more terrifying brilliance than Thomas Harris.” Sidestepping the bold central claim (in the whole last century?), what is left unsaid here is that the last time we saw Harris’s monsters in the open, many of his dedicated readers were profoundly let down. In 1999’s Hannibal, the culmination of the Lecter-Starling saga on the page, the tale ended with what John Lanchester described as the novel’s “moral algebra” being “spectacularly abandoned”. In short, Lecter’s worldview finally swallows Starling whole. She, tireless pursuer of murderers, fierce moralist, abandons it all. The pair move to Buenos Aires and become lovers. Some (including Stephen King) rather enjoyed the lurid leap of this, the devastating melodrama of Lecter’s icy allure finally triumphing and sucking a protector of lambs into the amoral void. But many loathed it not just for its sheer oddness – at one point, Starling actually breastfeeds Lecter – but for the deeper sense that it was a betrayal of Starling’s character. Jodie Foster felt so strongly about this that she didn’t reprise her role as Starling for the movie adaptation.Could this have been on Harris’s mind here, when he was writing Cari Mora? There is a moment in The Silence of the Lambs where Miggs – Lecter’s cell neighbour at the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane – flicks semen into Starling’s face. Lecter finds this “unspeakably ugly” that night, he kills Miggs by talking him into swallowing his tongue. Early in Cari Mora, meanwhile, Hans-Peter makes a plan to creep up on Cari while she is asleep and masturbate over her cheek, “little facial, what the hell?” Even if the similarity of these sexual transgression is pure coincidence, it highlights neatly the key difference between Lecter and Hans-Peter. Unlike the vast majority of real-life male serial killers, Lecter himself is no misogynist. Not one of his murder victims are female. He is, in fact, something of a gentleman. Without his strange chivalry, he and Starling’s infernal romance could never have come to fruition.Hans-Peter, meanwhile, is a dedicated misogynist of the most depraved sort. And his misogyny is but one aspect of a variety of ways in which he has none of Lecter’s demonic charisma. Constantly composing German ditties in his head, Hans-Peter is absurd, comic, perversely childish. He is devoid of Lecter’s scholarly refinement, never pausing to offer a bit of chilling, arresting atheism. Hans-Peter is also properly unhinged\u0026nbsp – to a degree that doesn’t always quite work, the novel’s voice becoming brittle and forced in portraying it. At one point we see Hans-Peter sat on the floor of his shower, blowing an Aztec death whistle until he collapses shortly afterwards, he pours a whole carton of milk over his head. This is a sort of manic, infantile madness one could never imagine with Lecter, who is so preternaturally composed that his pulse rate doesn’t rise when he’s biting a nurse’s tongue off.Hans-Peter is, in short, utterly without charm. Throughout the novel, Cari is never anything other than repulsed by him. Many readers saw Starling’s capitulation at the end of Hannibal as not only silly, but a sort of feminine defeat. There is no such defeat in Cari Mora. Hans-Peter and Cari do not move to Buenos Aires and go to the opera and live sexually ever after. Some of the basics of the scenario feel like a rehash of Starling’s arc. Like Starling, Cari is an orphan, with the psychic scars to show for it. (Her family was massacred by paramilitaries in her second year as a soldier, and “when she heard she could not speak aloud for two weeks”). Starling had her screaming lambs Cari Mora is haunted by the memory of seeing two lovestruck 13-year-olds executed in the Colombian jungle. But unlike Starling, this damage does not leave her vulnerable to the dark persuasions of a serial murderer. Cari is stoic, preternaturally unflustered by horror. The novel is named for her, not her murderous pursuer – a privilege never bestowed on Starling. The pursuer is almost laughably unworthy of her actual affection. “Bound wrists appeared a lot in Cari’s dreams,” we read but when her wrists are actually bound in real life, she ingeniously escapes them. And when Cari is asked whether she wants “a guy,” her response, given a melody, could be a Beyoncé lyric: “I want to own the front door. Then maybe I invite somebody in it.”It’s tempting to say that this is Harris for the #MeToo era, but every one of his novels has featured what is commonly termed a strong female protagonist. This was chiefly what the end of Hannibal betrayed, for many. Cari is what is commonly termed badass, but so was Starling. The difference is that here, with a plot that mirrors many of the rudiments of his most famous one, Harris plays out a very different final act. Lust’s hungry gaze, and the rage that attends the rejected male, was always present in the Hannibal novels. Throughout, Starling is relentlessly ogled, and her career at the FBI is ultimately ruined by a man who never forgave her for spurning his advances, and loathed “the picky, petty homemaking skills of a woman” that made her such a brilliant agent. Cari is ogled too, but at the end of the novel named after her, she very clearly refuses to acquiesce to the manipulation of a violent male. Unlike the Hannibal novels, we see no final, masculine triumph of the sort of blind force that Simone Weil read into the Iliad.Lecter in the TV series ‘Hannibal’ (Rex)It is impossible not to ask: is this depiction of Hans-Peter and Cari, with its obvious echoes of Lecter and Starling, Harris reacting against the critiques of where he ended the latter arc in Hannibal? Is it an admission of narrative regret, even an attempt to partially repair that damage? Ridley Scott’s adaptation of Hannibal removed that sexually-ever-after ending, because Scott found it preposterous. Harris was apparently not only unoffended by this, but so convinced by Scott’s scepticism that he helped the screenwriter, Steve Zaillian, write the movie’s new ending. Did Harris have his doubts even then, less than two years after the book went to print? Is this why Hannibal Rising was so heartlessly dashed off? This is all scepticism, not least because Harris hasn’t given an interview in decades. But the uncharitable reading here would be that what Harris really wanted to do with Cari Mora was offer a coda or alternate ending to the Lecter-Starling arc – and he had to find a rather ordinary thriller plot in which to embed it.The animal care of Harris’s novels is a charity of this kind. A sort of defiant, doomed, selfless stand against the animal kingdom’s mindless gobbling“A thousand birds murmuring and stirring, strident peeps from some chicks until they were quieted with a snack of regurgitated fish.”\u0026nbspCari Mora reiterates Harris’s Ligottian cosmos. It is a world where life and matter cannibalizes itself in a storm of appetites where the true soundtrack of reality is digestion. The greed for gold and the greed for sexual satisfaction are rolled into one big human hunger, and together they are what drag Cari through a harrowing few weeks in what has already been a pretty harrowing life. The book’s atmosphere is biology, happening. That disillusionment of Darwin. Harris, who grew up in the Bible Belt, always clearly enjoyed himself with Lecter’s godlessness (the flesh-eating psychiatrist “collects church collapses, recreationally”). In Cari Mora, characters constantly say Dios se lo pague\u0026nbsp(God bless you) to one another, even as the novel’s events are quite clearly not being overseen by a benevolent actor – and indeed any such benevolent actor receives fewer mentions than the gods of that committedly cannibalistic civilisation, the Aztecs.And yet: as in the rest of Harris’s novels, it is resisting the merciless storm of predation, of organic matter consuming its other iterations, that is made noble. According to a reporter who in 1999 tracked down Harris’s childhood acquaintances, Harris struggled to makes friends in hard-bitten, Fifties Mississippi because “he wasn’t athletic at all, and even less interested in killing animals”. The bird rehabilitation centre that Cari works at is real, and in the book’s acknowledgements Harris calls it a “remarkable, humane institution”. Despite having stacked the deck against himself with admirable enthusiasm, Harris’s heroes all refuse to accept that fleshy vulnerability is the sum of things. They want to protect the meek, and minimise easy slaughter. The universe is forever dining on itself, but figures like Starling and Mora want to interrupt the meal.Lecter\u0026nbspthrillers saw the budding serial killer played by Gaspard Ulliel (Rex)In 2001, when Harris was a rather more immediate part of the fiction landscape, the critic David Sexton wrote that he “easily stands comparison with the great melodramatists of the past: Bram Stoker, Conan Doyle, Wilkie Collins or Edgar Allan Poe, say, perhaps even Robert Louis Stevenson. He will last as they have lasted.” Readers will make up\u0026nbsptheir own about this. But if his melodrama does survive, it will be because it makes grand this battle: blind, devouring cosmos, simple recycling of matter, versus a belief that the vulnerable deserve protecting, that even if the war is always being lost such small battles of compassion are worth the fighting. This belief, as Lecter would delight in reminding us, can only ever be an assertion, a sort of faith. This is a stretch, but could it be that Harris, the old Southerner, didn’t shake all of his Christianity? The cover of Cari Mora is festooned with an image of Our Lady of Charity, Catholic patroness of Cuba and that nation’s quintessential religious icon. (Miami is, of course, a Cuba away from Cuba.) “Charity,” in the biblical sense, is a fudged translation of the ancient Greek agapē, which means something more like selfless love. The animal care of Harris’s novels is a charity of this kind. A sort of defiant, doomed, selfless stand against the animal kingdom’s mindless gobbling.What stops Harris’s books from being a pure hellscape of appetite is mercy, care. This time round, his lady of charity – Cari is short for Caridad, Spanish for charity – resists pandemonium. History’s most fervent opponents of cannibalisms, we might note, were all Christian missionaries. They in turn advocated a form of cannibalism that was not only consensual but strongly encouraged, because it freed us from this animal gauntlet, Christ’s transubstantiated flesh and blood lifting us at the Last Judgement into a place where we weren’t condemned to the iron logic of the physical. Today’s Harris, it would seem, wants the feast to go differently. It is a rather ordinary thriller, but Cari Mora is interesting for being a sort of repentance: Having served Starling to a man dripping in Satan imagery, he now wishes he could snatch her, and the silence of her lambs, back from between his elegant jaws.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A bottlenose dolphin’s encephalization quotient, a measure of brain to body size ratio, is second only to that of a human.Their intelligence is part of the reason they have proven to be such successful animals. The blue whale is the largest creature ever known to have lived, weighing as much as 140 tons. The much smaller killer whale is the blue whale’s only natural threat in the sea and is an apex predator in all the world’s oceans.We also know that their intelligence evolved long before our own, tens of millions of years earlier, making it highly likely that dolphins and other toothed whales possessed the greatest intellectual power before Homo sapiens.Created with Sketch.

Tiger sharks are one of the few species of shark that do attack humans, and are known to be a menace to whales as well. For whatever reason, the whale appeared to have wanted to save Hauser and was manoeuvring her out of the way of the shark.Created with Sketch.Whale intelligence continues to be underestimated Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mom and calf humpback whales make their way toward the surface in Tonga.salto della megattera durante whale watching  in islanda, salto della balena, incredibileAn aerial photo of humpback whales in a podHumpback mother and calf, with a snorkeler, in Tonga.Humpback Whale breaching out of water in the morning light in Icelandhumpback whales playing on surface in the blue between Tahiti and MooreaA beached grey whale which died after an effort by local fishermen to pull her back out to sea.

Their underwater “songs” carry for hundreds of miles.This was not the only example of humpback whales interfering to save the lives of other species. These whales have been seen putting themselves between oceanic predators, typically killer whales, and other marine life, including the calves of other whales, seals and sunfish. Dolphins (part of the same family that includes the large baleen whales) have been known to help save drowning humans.What motivates a whale to save a human or a sunfish is unknown. It could be a form of altruism, or the result of protective instincts towards a calf, or the protection of a wider group, or another behaviour we haven’t thought of. This kind of activity seems to confirm the whale’s position in our minds as semi-mythical beings, cruising the world’s oceans singing to each other and conducting good deeds.Yet it wasn’t long ago that whales were appreciated more for their capacity to produce oil for a range of household products than for their apparent altruism.We hunted whales in their tens of thousands every year, pulling back only when their populations were on the verge of extinction and the industrial hunting of whales had become less profitable. Whaling on a significant scale continued well into the 1960s and 1970s.Our entire way of thinking about intelligence is skewed by our own perception of what it means to be smart, which inevitably involves comparing other animals against our own intelligencePart of the problem was that whales have historically been difficult to study in the wild they were seen as being akin to giant fish rather than sophisticated marine mammals, gifted with some of the largest and most complex brains ever to have evolved.“They have a very, very complicated brain,” Lori Marino, a renowned neuroscientist and expert in animal behaviour and intelligence, says.“That is something we only discovered when we started to use imaging techniques. People thought their brains were large but kind of simple, now we know that is not the case.”Marino’s work with dolphins has included the publication of conclusive evidence that bottlenose dolphins can recognise themselves in a mirror, putting themselves in the company of only a few animals, including ourselves, a few of the great apes, Asian elephants and magpies.Adapted to an environment very different to our own, the whale brain has developed to meet different needs, in a three-dimensional world where the requirements to survive and thrive do not present a ready comparison with our lives.Frustratingly, for anyone after an answer to the question of\u0026nbsp“how smart is the dolphinwhale?”,\u0026nbspthe answer is not only that we don’t know but that our capacity to answer that question is limited by both our current understanding of neuroscience and our own biases.Our entire way of thinking about intelligence is skewed by our own perception of what it means to be smart, which inevitably involves comparing other animals against our own intelligence. For today’s scientists, the question is not\u0026nbsphow smart are the whales, but in what ways can we consider them to be smart and how are they using that intelligence to succeed in their environment?iStock)“When people ask me, ‘Are dolphins smart?’ I say, ‘I don’t know, but I can tell you the ways in which they are smart,’”\u0026nbspJanet Mann, professor of biology and psychology at Georgetown University says. “What we do know is they do X, Y and Z, and if they can do those things, there must be some brain power behind it.”One hallmark of a whale’s intelligence is its ability to communicate and navigate underwater. A dolphin’s world view is necessarily more acoustic than our own, with echolocation (sonar) providing a 3D map of their surroundings that is incorporated into a visual image of their surroundings. It is processed and perceived in a way we find hard to fully understand.“They have a holistic view of what they are perceiving,” Marino says.\u0026nbsp“We might hear a sound and remember a sound but the way their brain works is echolocation mixing with the visual image, producing something like a hologram.”As dolphins “see” their world in sound, as well as communicating about their world in sound, it is likely that they are able to project an idea of what they are seeing at other members of their immediate group. The sound is transmitted as an “auditory image”, rather than requiring the brain to interpret the sound and imagine what the image might be.This is likely to be an efficient and accurate way of exchanging information between members of a group, not least because it is now thought that dolphins have an enhanced capacity to process the information their brains are receiving, possibly up to 20 times faster than a human brain.Their brains also appear to be wired up to experience a range of emotions and may have an advanced sense of self-awareness. In a killer whale, the limbic system, a part of the brain associated with emotional awareness and memory formation, is exaggerated to the point where it has formed a unique structure on the brain now known as the paralimbic lobe.In recent years, scientists have begun to speculate that this part of the brain is also responsible for a form of collective self-awareness between members of a pod.“They may have some sense of self that is spread out among\u0026nbspthe rest of their pod,” according to Marino. “What happens to members of the pod, happens to them.”It is a theory that\u0026nbspgoes some way towards explaining events like mass strandings, where an entire group of whales (often the pilot whale) beaches itself, apparently due to the distress of one particular inidual. They are highly dependent on their social networks for every element of their lives, and have a very keen sense of friend and foe, as well as close family bonds.They are cultural animals and have a lot of interesting cultural traditions that they follow which makes them something very familiar to us“With bottlenose dolphins, we can see a multi-level alliance structure,” says Mann.“In bottlenose dolphins, the community is never together all at once. To determine who is connected to who and how, among\u0026nbsphundreds or even thousands of iniduals they associate with, they must sample their network to work out who is friend or foe. We also know they can identify friends and foes partly based on the cultural behaviours that are passed down.”In the wild, examples of this “whale culture” in action includes a population of dolphins that have been seen using the body of a scorpion fish to prod a moray eel out of hiding, another puts sea sponges on their beaks to assist in the location of fish that are hiding under a rock or sand, a form of tool use.Each of these techniques demonstrates a high level of problem-solving capability, but the capacity to hand down this behaviour to future generations is of equal interest to the people studying these animals, as this shows a form of culture has developed within particular populations.“They are very cultural animals and have a lot of interesting cultural traditions that they follow which makes them something very familiar to us. That is true for belugas, orca and bottlenoses as well as other kinds of cetacean,” Marino says.“They have to depend on learning to keep those traditions going, which requires intelligence.”From the 1960s onwards, scientists started to spend significant amounts of time among\u0026nbspwhales, much of it with bottlenose dolphins in captivity. They began to realise they were dealing with creatures that possess many of the attributes we typically associate with higher levels of intelligence, namely, problem-solving, self-recognition, elements of language, complex social structures and the ability to coordinate a group in the service of hunting or the protection of young and elder members of a family.Bottlenose dolphins in marine parks and military facilities have proved to be excellent problem solvers\u0026nbspand are able to understand complicated commands issued to them by human instructors.According to\u0026nbspMann, “They can remember the signature whistle of a specific dolphin more than 20 years after they last interacted with that dolphin.“That suggests they have long-term recognition. Unlike with humans, dolphins don’t have visual stimuli like photographs to help them remember things in the intervening period.”\u0026nbspMany of the researchers who spend time with these animals say that, far from being a one-way study, the dolphins are incredibly quick-witted and seem to be testing the intelligence of the scientists, playing tricks and games with the researchers even while\u0026nbspthey are being studied.One of the most notable examples of this was a field trip in 1985 when a group of researchers looking into dolphin behaviour got bored at staring into at an empty sea and tried to find other ways of keeping themselves amused while they waited for their subject matter.To entertain his fellow crew members, one of the scientists put seaweed on his head and pretended to be Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea. He then threw the seaweed into the water and turned back his colleagues. Moments later a dolphin appeared next to the boat, with the seaweed on her head.It is possible that this was a coincidence, but dolphins are known to be excellent mimics, something that is seen by thousands of people in aquaria around the world. For scientists, this kind of playfulness, which is widely exhibited by dolphins in the wild, is also a hallmark of intelligence.As is so often the case with our oceans, when it comes to understanding and interpreting the intelligence of marine mammals, there is still a lot we don’t know. Seemingly every major study brings up new behaviours and traits that we had not considered before, or had not thought possible.One conclusion we can draw from our current knowledge is the practice of having large cetaceans in aquaria is likely to be causing the animals considerable distress.Marino no longer works with whales or dolphins in captivity and is founder and president of the Whale Sanctuary Project, which aims to retire orcas and belugas in entertainment parks to naturalistic seaside sanctuaries.“In a concrete tank they have no reason to use most of their senses,” she says “certainly not echolocation, certainly not a lot of sound as nothing is going on, there is not much to see. It is like sensory deprivation, there is nothing to do.“It is like being in a small room with the lights off and once in a while, someone gives you a sandwich under the door. It is like someone being held in solitary confinement.”How smart is a whale? We don’t know. But the question itself seems to miss the point.“I don’t think we fully understand how intelligent they are or the ways in which they are intelligent,” Marino concludes. “The ways that we recognise intelligence are the ways we recognise intelligence in ourselves. There is clearly a form of intelligence above and beyond our own in these animals but that is going to be very difficult for us to determine.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And ’twas ever thus. We all watched James Bond as he got more and more geriatric, and his girlfriends got younger and younger. It’s so annoying.”Gyllenhaal revealed she was told by a Hollywood producer that she was too old, aged 37, to play the love interest of a 55-year-old man. “It was astonishing to me. It made me feel bad, and then it made feel angry, and then it made me laugh,” she said at the time. Meryl Streep has helped fund an all-female screenwriters group called The Writer’s Lab to encourage more women to pen Hollywood scripts. She previously told Vogue in 2011: “Once women pass childbearing age they could only be seen as grotesque on some level.” The actress said she thought Hollywood is “still completely s***” when it comes to treating women equally to men. ““When I was younger, I really did think we were on our way to a better world. And when I look at it now, it is in a worse state than I have known it, particularly for women, and I find that very disturbing and sad.”“I had never seen a 49-year-old, dark-skinned woman who is not a size 2 be a sexualised role in TV or film. I\u0027m a sexual woman, but nothing in my career has ever identified me as a sexualised woman. I was the prototype of the ‘mommified’ role,” she told The Hollywood Reporter. The actress famously called out sexism on the red carpet at the 2014 Screen Actors Guild Awards. When a camera operator scanned her up and down, she said: “Do you do this to the guys?” In her Oscar acceptance speech for Blue Jasmine, she reminded the film industry that movies with leading women can still be successful. Asked if she had ever encountered sexism in Hollywood, Page told : ‘Oh my God, yeah! It\u0027s constant! It\u0027s how you\u0027re treated, it\u0027s how you\u0027re looked at, how you\u0027re expected to look in a photoshoot, it\u0027s how you\u0027re expected to shut up and not have an opinion, it\u0027s how you... If you\u0027re a girl and you don\u0027t fit the very specific vision of what a girl should be, which is always from a man\u0027s perspective, then you\u0027re a little bit at a loss.”The actress says she refuses roles where she has to play the generic girlfriend, wife or sexy bombshell. It\u0027s very hard being a woman in a man\u0027s world, and I recognised it was a man\u0027s world even when I was a kid. It\u0027s an inequality and injustice that drove me crazy, and which I always spoke out against — and I\u0027ve always been outspoken,” she told Manhattan magazine. The actress spoke to ELLE about negotiating equal pay for the Snow White and the Huntsman sequel: This is a good time for us to bring this to a place of fairness, and girls need to know that being a feminist is a good thing. It doesn\u0027t mean that you hate men. It means equal rights. If you\u0027re doing the same job, you should be compensated and treated in the same way.The 32-year-old actress said she has already experiences job rejections because of her age. “Now I\u0027m in my early thirties and I\u0027m like, \u0027Why did that 24-year-old get that part?

Dean Turner, UK economist as UBS Wealth Management, forecast that the pound could crash to as low as 1.15 against the dollar and close to parity against the euro in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He warned investors not to be complacent about the prospect.“Despite mounting public impatience over the process, many top officials and lawmakers remain fearful of the economic damage from a no-deal exit,” said Mr Turner.“Lingering uncertainty would likely cause firms to delay investment, and keep sterling under downward pressure.”“A UK decision to remain an EU member would likely cause a swift rebound in sterling, which we believe is undervalued relative to its purchasing power parity level of around USD 1.58.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A double-sided pull-out states:\u0026nbsp“A lot has been written about universal credit recently – not all of it correct, sadly.”One\u0026nbsppage lists a series of “myths” about the new system, pledging to “set the record straight”. Another page features an\u0026nbspinterview with a work coach\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspphotos of claimants\u0026nbspwho are said to have benefited from universal credit.The\u0026nbspadvertorial\u0026nbspwas published on the same day MPs heard during a parliamentary committee hearing\u0026nbspthat women on universal credit had been pushed into such severe hardship they were forced into sex work as a means of survival.One charity worker told the Work and Pensions Committee that women were saying they “exchange sex for £2, or for laundry, or for a bottle of cider or for food”.She said the new benefit system was a factor in the rise of survival sex work, adding: “Universal credit has really exacerbated the problem. We are seeing increasing numbers of women doing it who haven’t before.”Women forced into ‘survival sex’ for as little as £2, laundry or foodHours before, the UN published a damning report condemning austerity measures in the UK which accused ministers of being in a “state of denial” about “exacerbating inequality and poverty” across the country.\u0026nbspSpecial rapporteur Philip Alston said universal credit was being implemented in ways that negatively impacted claimants’ mental health, finances and work prospects, saying reforms were “urgent” and should “go well beyond tinkering”.\u0026nbsp“While surveys indicate positive experiences for some universal credit claimants, the bottom line is that a system supposedly designed to bring major and much-needed improvements is fast falling into universal discredit,” he wrote in his report.Politicians and campaigners accused ministers of “wasting huge chunks of desperately needed resources” on the advertorial, while claimants struggling under the new system expressed frustration at the “one-sided” campaign.Frank Field MP, chair of the Work and Pensions Select Committee,\u0026nbsphas written to the DWP\u0026nbspdemanding details on the cost of the campaign, whether work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd personally approved the plans, and what guarantees the department can give as to the accuracy of the advertorial.“If the DWP wants to understand the facts about universal credit, it could look to the horrific, harrowing evidence we heard this morning,” said the independent MP.“People – mostly women, single mums, students – are telling us that they are forced through sheer desperation to exchange sex for the means to feed, house and warm themselves and their children.\u0026nbsp“Rather than wasting huge chunks of desperately needed resources on 10 weeks of advertorial, why won’t the government just take a look at the terrible reality of the facts we and so many others are showing them for free, and instead spend that money on making some of its claims about universal credit helping people come true?”One claimant, Martin Weaver, 42, who suffers from kidney disease and heart disease, and\u0026nbsphas had money deducted from his universal credit entitlement every month since he started receiving the benefit, said the advertorial was “one-sided”.“Their spin on it is infuriating,” said the father, who has to go to hospital three times a week for kidney dialysis. “Considering we’re in these harsh times I think it’s wrong that they could spend £200,000 putting this spin on it. That money could bring in some more staff to help with the backlogs on cases.“It only takes into account the people who actually do benefit, and to be honest I’m yet to meet anyone on it who is better off on it. Why would a government department need to advertise unless they realised it’s that bad?”Garry Lemon, director of policy and research at the Trussell Trust, said the DWP should\u0026nbspprioritise fixing the issues with universal credit before spending time on a PR campaign.\u0026nbsp“They need to first focus on tackling the reasons why so many of the people who need\u0026nbsphelp are being forced to food banks after moving onto universal credit,” he said.James Taylor, head of policy at disability equality charity Scope, meanwhile said the “simplistic”\u0026nbspadvertorial failed to\u0026nbspreflect disabled people’s experiences of the new system, adding: “If the DWP is to build trust in the system they need to acknowledge the challenges disabled people face and act.”Anger over the advertorial\u0026nbspcomes after The Independent revealed figures showing that £1 of every £10 in universal credit payments is deducted from claimants, prompting concerns the government is “penalising struggling families”.A DWP spokesperson said: “It is important people know about the benefits available to them, and we regularly advertise universal credit.\u0026nbspAll our advertising abides by the strict guidelines set by the Advertising Standards Authority.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Has argued that a no-deal exit would reflect the result of the 2016 referendum. The\u0026nbspformer mayor of London\u0026nbspwas once seen as the “Heineken candidate” capable of reaching voters other Tories could not. But his star has waned among Tory\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspleft unimpressed by his two years as foreign secretary.\u0026nbspHis popularity among Tory activists would give him a strong chance of winning if he made the final shortlist, but he might be blocked by a determined “stop Boris” campaign already being planned by his critics. If successful, the move would anger many Tory activists.Leadsom’s\u0026nbspleadership hopes have been revived (Getty)Resigned from the cabinet on the eve of the European elections, saying she no longer believed the government’s approach would deliver the Brexit referendum result the people voted for.She showed her inexperience in the 2016 leadership election, withdrawing to leave May as the last candidate standing after making comments appearing to suggest\u0026nbspshe would make a better leader because she had children.Javid is one of the frontrunners to replace Theresa May (Jack TaylorGetty)Backed Remain in 2016 referendum despite his Eurosceptic instincts. Now a keen Brexiteer, and prepared to keep a no-deal exit on the table. Has consistently challenged\u0026nbspMay in cabinet meetings.Ambitious and has a brilliant backstory as the son of Pakistani bus driver who came to the UK with £1 in his pocket. But appears to be suffering from the curse of being one of the frontrunners in the Tory race. His stock has fallen recently after what some MPs see as unforced errors such as his handling of\u0026nbspmigrants crossing the English channel and his decision to strip Isis schoolgirl Shamima Begum of her UK citizenship.Remainer who briefly supported a Final Say referendum on the Brexit deal after the 2016 vote. Now rejects the idea, and is seen as a born-again Brexiteer who also wants to keep a no-deal departure on the table.His pitch would be as the candidate who could unite the Tories’ warring factions. Tory members might judge him too much of a Remainer. Critics worry that his long stint as\u0026nbsphealth secretary\u0026nbspcould return to haunt him at a general election. Could benefit from a slide in Javid’s fortunes, but will not want to overtake him to become\u0026nbspthe frontrunner.Along with Johnson, headed the victorious Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum. Even his critics admit he is one of the few successful departmental ministers since his surprise return to May’s cabinet in 2017, a year after she sacked him.Has been a loyal and articulate promoter of the withdrawal agreement. Critics see this as in part an attempt to shed his reputation as an assassin who turned on\u0026nbspJohnson\u0026nbspto run for the leadership in 2016.Gove’s\u0026nbsprefusal to join other Brexiteers in resigning from the cabinet might count against him among\u0026nbspEurosceptics. However, many of them are now coming round to his strategy of getting the deal “over the line” to save Brexit.Eurosceptic former chief of staff to David Davis, and followed his path by becoming and then resigning as Brexit secretary, complaining he was kept out of the loop by May and her civil service negotiator Olly Robbins. Displayed a grip on the detail while in the job, and impressed May allies in the 2016 referendum when he campaigned for Leave.\u0026nbspBut did not impress Brussels officials.A fresh face, although his relative lack of cabinet experience could count against him. But a\u0026nbspdark horse to watch in a leadership race. Has a big decision to make: will he back May’s deal if Johnson\u0026nbspdoes, or decide to have clean hands and oppose it to the end, and potentially be on the losing side?A new entrant in the leadership race and, at 40, could be the youngest candidate. A rare breed in the May government as a survivor of David Cameron’s regime: before becoming an MP in 2010, he was chief of staff to George Osborne. Impressed as culture secretary, as one of the few UK politicians to understand the digital era and power of the internet giants. Has also shown grip in a testing job since his promotion to health and social care secretary.Smooth media performer who does not lack ambition. Described by some MPs as “a better version of Jeremy Hunt”, he is Remainer-turned-Leaver who could unite his fractious party. Has gone into bat for May’s deal when others kept their head down. Could be part of a “stop Boris” drive in which Johnson’s rivals try to share out MPs’ votes to keep him off the shortlist. Seen by some Tories as the leader after next.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

My sense, for what it’s worth, is that we are facing a total wipeout – zero MEPs. I just hope our next leader can get Brexit over the line,” he said.Polls certainly suggest the Tories are heading for their worst national election result in history, and could on a very bad night even be reduced to a vote share of single figures.Though votes were cast in the UK on Thursday, the final results will not be released until after 10pm on Sunday night, when polls have closed in all 28 EU member states.Theresa May set to announce resignation as prime ministerThe current record low result for the Tories was the previous 2014 EU elections, in which they won just 23.1 per cent.\u0026nbspMost of the Tories\u0027 voters are expected to go to the Brexit Party, Nigel\u0026nbspFarge\u0027s\u0026nbspnew outfit – which looks set to romp to victory.The backdrop to the historically poor result is Theresa May\u0027s failure to get her Brexit deal through parliament, despite three, going on four, attempts to do so – which included government defeats of historic proportions.On the eve of the election Conservatives Cabinet ministers rubbed salt into the party\u0027s wounds by reportedly launching an attempted coup against the prime minister\u0027s party leadership – just hours before voters headed to polling stations.Created with Sketch.Farage launches his new Brexit Party: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nigel Farage speaks at the launch of his new Brexit Party\u0027s campaign for the European electionsBrexit Party candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, speaks at the launchA supporter waits for Farage to speakSupporters wait for Farage to speakFarage and prospective candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg wait at the launchSupporters listen as Farage speaksFree T-shirts for all attendees Posters on the seats for supporters of the Brexit PartyNigel Farage speaks at the launch of his new Brexit Party\u0027s campaign for the European electionsBrexit Party candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, speaks at the launchA supporter waits for Farage to speakSupporters wait for Farage to speakFarage and prospective candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg wait at the launchSupporters listen as Farage speaksFree T-shirts for all attendees Posters on the seats for supporters of the Brexit PartyMs May is expected to confirm her resignation on Friday, with a successor expected to be put in place by early June.The runaway frontrunner to replace her is Boris Johnson – who has suggested he might take Britain out of the EU without a deal.

Boris Johnson hailed a very dignified statement, adding: Thank you for your stoical service to our country and the Conservative Party. It is now time to follow her urgings: to come together and deliver Brexit. Dominic Raab said: Dignified as ever, Theresa May\u0026nbspshowed her integrity. She remains a dedicated public servant, patriot and loyal Conservative.But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that Ms May had shown herself unable to govern and her administration\u0026nbsphad utterly failed the country over Brexit and is unable to improve people’s lives. He called for her successor to call an immediate general election.Ms May\u0027s dramatic announcement came after the chair of the Tories\u0027 backbench 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady, met her in Downing Street to demand a timetable for her departure.Created with Sketch.Theresa May gets emotional during her resignation  Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Prime Minister Theresa May makes a statement outside at 10 Downing Street in London, where she announced she is standing down as Tory party leader on Friday June 7.Prime Minister Theresa May makes a statement outside at 10 Downing Street in London, where she announced she is standing down as Tory party leader on Friday June 7.Standing at a lectern outside the famous black door to Number 10, Ms May\u0026nbspsaid that as prime minister she had “done her best” to negotiate a deal to take the UK out of the European Union in a way that protects jobs, security and our Union.But she added: I have done everything I can to convince MPs to back that deal. Sadly I have not been able to do so.“I tried three times. I believe it was right to persevere even when the odds against success seemed high.“But it is now clear to me that it is in the best interests of the country for a new prime minister to lead that effort.Ms May said it was a matter of deep regret that she had\u0026nbspnot been able to deliver Brexit and warned that her successor\u0026nbspwill have to seek\u0026nbspconsensus across parliament to find a solution.Such a consensus can only be reached if those on all sides of the debate are willing to compromise, she said.Speaking a day after European elections in which the Conservatives are believed to have slumped to their worst performance in their history, Ms May insisted that the party can renew itself in the years ahead.She cited progress in reducing the deficit, rising jobs figures, the introduction of\u0026nbspan industrial strategy, house-building, funding for mental health, the race disparity audit\u0026nbspand action to tackle plastic waste as the legacy of the decent, moderate and patriotic government which she led.And her voice broke as she concluded: Our politics may be under strain, but there is so much that is good about this country. So much to be proud of. So much to be optimistic about.I will shortly leave the job that it has been the honour of my life to hold – the second female Prime Minister but certainly not the last.I do so with no ill-will, but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love.Shortly afterwards, she left Downing Street by car with Philip, apparently heading for her constituency home in Berkshire.May’s widely-forecast departure came after a cabinet revolt against her latest\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspplan, unveiled on Tuesday, which offered a \u0026nbspset of concessions in the hope of winning a cross-party majority in the Commons.The toxic detail which sealed her fate was the offer of a Commons vote on whether to hold a second Brexit referendum, with the promise that - if approved by\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbsp– \u0026nbspno EU withdrawal settlement could be ratified without a Final Say ballot.This sparked a wave of angry Tory MPs to withdraw their support, and a string of cabinet ministers to demand changes to the bill. Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt delivered the final blow on Thursday by telling the PM to her face that she must kill the bill.MPs in Westminster were already lining up behind rival candidates for the leadership. Would-be Tory leaders must first win their way through a series of MPs\u0027 votes in June\u0026nbspto get onto a shortlist of two.The final pair of contenders will take part in a series of hustings around the UK before a ballot of the 125,000-strong party membership.Former foreign secretary Mr Johnson is hot favourite among activists, but is likely to face a challenge for MPs\u0027 votes from Mr Hunt, environment secretary Michael Gove, former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab and Andrea Leadsom, whose resignation as leader of the Commons on Wednesday helped push Ms May over the brink. Other contenders could include health secretary Matt Hancock, defence secretary Penny Mordaunt,\u0026nbspinternational development secretary Rory Stewart and\u0026nbspformer work and pensions secretary Esther McVey.\u0026nbspBy holding on to her position until the summer, Ms May ensured that she will overtake\u0026nbspGordon Brown\u0027s record of two years and\u0026nbsp319 days in office next Wednesday, and is likely to pass the three-year mark as PM\u0026nbspon July 13.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At the end of the day the tragedy of it is that it\u0027s self-inflicted. She doesn’t listen very well to advice.“Her deal was voted down very clearly three times, and then to try and bring it back, effectively for a fourth time, was pretty daft.“It’s because she didn’t listen to her party or her colleagues that in the end the Dancing Queen has met her Waterloo.”May jigged to the stage at the Tory party conference last October.The BBC’s Europe editor Katya Adler says EU leaders have made the “assumption” that May\u0027s successor might ask for more time, whether to hold a general election or to even make an effort to renegotiate the Brexit deal.Today’s resignation announcement has apparently got EU chiefs immediately thinking about whether more time could be offered beyond the 31 October deadline.“Germany would prefer to give the UK more time, if not to change its mind about Brexit, then at least to ensure an “orderly exit” – ie Brexit with a deal – to avoid the economic and political fallout of no deal at all,” tweeted Adler.Steve Bannon and George Galloway reportedly hugged each other after hearing about May’s resignation. The unlikely pair were speaking together at an event in Kazakhstan.Here’s Tom Embury-Dennis with the details.More from Boris Johnson’s speech in Switzerland. He said Britain could forge a “fantastic free trade relationship with Europe after it quits the EU, but can also be a champion for global free trade.The UK has the world’s most erse capital, along with a world class technology sector and universities, he told an event in Switzerland. But Britain should also focus on leaving the EU, with MPs agreeing not to revoke Article 50, which began the exit process.“The job of our next leader has to be getting the UK properly out of the EU, putting Brexit to be,” he said.Theresa May’s constituency chairman Richard Kellaway has been talking about her decision to stay on as MP for Maidenhead. “The main concern for us as her association is that she\u0027s not going to resign her seat,” he said. “She will carry on as a member of parliament, which is welcomed by us.”Mr Kellaway compared the Prime Minister\u0027s emotional speech to a eulogy, and said she had spoken “extremely well”.“It’s like any speech at a funeral or a wedding, even,” he said. “You get through it. She spoke extremely well I thought, it was really just at the end when she got a bit emotional.“It\u0027s highly understandable that giving up a high office like that is stressful and very, very sad.”What does Boris Johnson believe in? Here’s our political correspondent Lizzy Buchan will a look at the Tory leadership favourite’s voting record.The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has said it was “disgraceful” of Theresa May to cite her response to the Grenfell fire disaster as a proud part of her legacy.Here’s Jon Sharman with more details.Boris Johnson has been speaking about Brexit and the prospect of a no deal exit at an economic conference in Switzerland this afternoon following May’s resignation announcement. He said the UK should be prepared to walk out of the EU without a deal if it is to negotiate a suitable exit agreement, according to Reuters.“The way to get a good deal is to prepare for a no deal,” said the Tory leadership favourite. “We will leave the EU on October 31, deal or no deal.” In a reference to May’s departure, he added: “It turned out to be quite a good day to be out of London … We are at a very interesting point in political history”.Jeremy Hunt has reportedly announced he will stand in the Tory leader contest at a festival in his constituency today.The BBC says the foreign secretary, a loyal ally of Theresa May, revealed the news at the Haslemere Festival in his constituency of southwest Surrey.As political pundits consider May’s legacy, new figures show the impact of the Conservative government has had on housing Britain’s most vulnerable.Child homelessness\u0026nbsphas risen 80 per cent since the party came into government in 2010, with a new household now\u0026nbspfound to be homeless every five\u0026nbspminutes, official data has revealed.Here’s our social affairs correspondent May Bulman with the details.Mark Drakeford, first minister of Wales, has offered his thoughts on May’s department and a change of Tory party leadership.“I’ve never doubted the Prime Minister’s sense of public service or her commitment to do her job \u0026amp I wish her well for the future,” the Labour figure tweeted.“It is however, her red lines that have brought her to the end of the road and left us in a mess of her making. A Conservative leadership contest is the last thing we need as we negotiate one of the biggest challenges and uncertainties our country has faced in decades.“The prospect of achieving an orderly Brexit – one that protects our economy \u0026amp jobs – by the 31st October seems less likely. A change of leader will change nothing, we need a change of approach to Brexit based on compromise \u0026amp a will to heal the growing isions in our country.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In fact, Amy was an A-grade student who went off the rails at  after suffering a serious sexual assault by a fellow pupil. Her behaviour deteriorated and she ended up being excluded from school and sent to one of the country’s  Pupil Referral Units .Amy - who met the Duchess of Cambridge earlier this month - is far from alone. Permanent exclusions in Britain have soared by an incredible  per cent in just three years, rising from , in   to , in  .And a staggering , pupils a year are illegally ‘off-rolled’ - the controversial practice of removing dficult or struggling kids from the school register to boost exam results.This week, as teens across the country knuckle down to their GCSEs, The Sun lts the lid on the scandal of Britain’s rising number of ‘Unteachable’ kids - those who are excluded, off-rolled and disappear from our education system.Many of the , kids excluded every day from British schools  end up in PRUs, which officials have described as ‘hotbeds’ of gang grooming and sex attacks.They’re designed to house pupils with Special Educational Needsor behavioural issues, but the reality, according to Amy, is that all too often they become a dumping ground for vulnerable or dficult youngsters, some as young as five.For her part, Amy, who helped the Duchess of Cambridge launch the new Pears Family School for excluded children in London, says she had a loving and happy childhood. “I was very much loved as a child,” she recalls. “My parents worked tirelessly to make sure my needs were met and that I had opportunities to do extra-curricular things.”The young Amy dreamed of becoming a doctor or a police officer but that all changed when she was  and suffered a serious sexual assault by a male pupil at her secondary school. Amy went immediately to the police, only to be told there wasn’t enough evidence to take action against her teenage attacker.  As a result, he was allowed to stay at the school, meaning that a terried Amy saw him most days, often coming within inches of him in the school corridor. , students excluded from school every day on averageVulnerable and isolated, Amy retreated into herself, turning to drink to numb her fear: on one occasion running off during school time to buy alcohol. When she became disruptive, she found herself permanently excluded.“No one referred me to an emotional well-being service,” she says. “I was a really good student at the time, but no-one understood or listened.”Forced outside the mainstream education system, Amy ended up at two dferent PRUs. At one, she was the lone girl in a school filled with boys - a terrying prospect for any young woman, let alone one who had been sexually assaulted. It’s a frighteningly common situation: for every girl, three boys are permanently excluded. Surrounded by a classroom full of boys every day, Amy’s schoolmates would constantly pester her and try to “outdo each other” to grab her attention.“No one was focusing on learning, that was the last of priorities,” she says. “The main focus was not being the weakest one – otherwise you were at risk of being the victim of manipulation.”Amy claims that at one of the PRUs, even the most basic needs were barely being met: while she used to enjoy hot meals at her secondary school, she claims she was given only a sandwich for lunch – with just one slice of bread.“You got no food, you got no education, no-one was there to protect you from a fight breaking out,” she says.“I know quite a few people did go out to the shops and just take something. Kids are just trying to survive.“I even knew people in the PRU that used to threaten others with a kne just for money for food because of how hungry they were.”And so the girl who once aspired to being a doctor had to settle for studying only four GCSEs – one below the five required to get into further education.She’s not alone in this - only one per cent of PRU students achieve five good GCSEs.“One of those only had an hour of teaching for the whole thing,” she says. “We only got one hour a week for the other three GCSEs.” It’s far from uncommon: more than  per cent of PRU pupils become NEETwhen they leave aged , while % of those in Young Offenders’ Institutions have been excluded.Chair of the Education Committee and Tory MP Robert Halfon, who has backed our series, warns that by the time a child arrives at a PRU they are on a ‘collision course with failure’. Amy was one of the lucky ones: a teaching assistant at her unit, recognising her potential, introduced her to a local college teacher who took the time to understand her story and enrolled her for A-levels.“After spilling out my le story, [the college staff] came to an understanding of the circumstances and understood the extent of the trauma that disrupted my le, she says.“I often still think about the kindness shown that day and the huge risk they took. I hadn’t been prone to that type of understanding and kindness for years, so I was overwhelmed.”Returning to mainstream education wasn’t easy though: accustomed to being on the defensive, Amy frequently clashed with other pupils.  Despite her struggles, she passed her A-Levels, enough to secure a course in politics and international relations at Kent University, graduating last year with a :. “Mum and dad were so proud,” she says. “It was one of the happiest days of their lives, because no-one from a PRU goes directly to further education and then directly to higher education.”Today, Amy is studying for a masters in international social policy and acting as a “young champion” for the Anna Freud Centrein King’s Cross.The Centre’s patron is the Duchess of Cambridge, who came to open the new Pears Family School, a facility for  children, aged five to , who have been excluded from school for bad behaviour, caused by ‘conduct disorders’ and emotional issues.She says: The negative stereotype of children in PRUs is not true.Its just that not many people take the time to talk and listen to them to understand their social background struggles and dficulties that they are exhaustingly fighting.We need to start including them and signying their voice among society so no one gets left behind.The Duchess - who has long been a passionate campaigner for mental health awareness and children’s well-being – was there when Amy delivered a short, powerful speech about her exclusion and sex abuse, and the two later met. “If someone said to me eight years ago I’d be at the school, meeting Kate, I wouldn’t have believed it,” laughs Amy. “She was beautul inside and out.”The Duchess of Cambridge’s new initiative may have shone light on the issue of Britain’s ‘unteachables’, but there is no quick solution to the tens of thousands of kids who have been turfed out of our schools.According to statutory guidance released by the Department for Education, such action should only be taken:Reasons for exclusion might include bullying, arson, vandalism, drug dealing, alcohol abuse, persistant disruptive behaviour, physical assault or racist abuse,.Youngsters who repeatedly fail to either follow academic instruction or complete a behavioural sanction, like a detention, may also find themselves kicked out.For who is to blame  While some teachers argue that lazy parents with no respect for authority are raising a generation of children so badly behaved that they have no choice but to exclude them, others cite ambitious headteachers desperate to massage their exam results and net bigger pay packets and promotions.Whatever the answer, Amy is clear about one thing - we mustn’t forget about these children.At the end of the day they are just human beings.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Jeremy Corbyn said it himself yesterday.We already knew he wants a second referendum, no doubt stitched up to try to ensure a Remain vote.But far more outrageous is his new admission that,he was in No, he’d be open to allowing free movement into the UK. So much for Labour’s manesto promise of an end to unlimited immigration.Brits have become noticeably less concerned about immigration since the referendum. That’s because people were promised that we would soon have control of our borders once again — open to the best and brightest, the striving and the hard-working — but with a say on who comes in and who doesn’t.If Labour chuck that away, they will reap a whirlwind. If the Tories give in to Corbyn on this vital point as part of a backroom deal, it’ll be the end of the party system as we know it, opening the door to all sorts of extreme forces.The Conservatives must realise nothing is more important than keeping Corbyn and his not-so-merry band of Marxists out of power. Their next leader must be capable of tearing into Labour and winning the public round. That work needs to start soon.The Prime Minister is costing the party its reputation for competence every single day and it’s hard to see merit in reviving her dead deal for what will surely be another humiliation in Parliament.The party needs a new figure to take the fight to the Opposition.FINALLY, something that looks like concrete action to crack down on Brit-born extremists.The Home Secretary is right to show how he’ll use his new powers to ensure that no UK citizen is able to swan off to jihadi-infested north west Syria without a very good reason indeed.There must be consequences. Too many people, mostly on the left, still seem to think we can write off these bloodthirsty terrorists as just youthful mischief-makers. They are not. They are traitors.Equally important is Sajid Javid’s call for international co-operation to tackle the Islamist menace across the world.Despite Brexit straining relations with Europe, we hope our neighbours are listening.BRIT Eurovision entry Michael Rice wasn’t that bad.We could put The Beatles on and we’d still end up mid-table.But then perhaps we’re used to being under-appreciated by Europe…The real winner of Saturday night, though, was Israel itself.How many other places in the Middle East could host that many people waving rainbow flags Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Shame on them.Critics say Farage has no policies other than implementing Brexit and they’re probably right — but so what  For the millions of disaffected British voters, that’s not what Thursday’s electionis about.Besides, Corbyn, May, Cable et al can announce as many impressive policies as they wish.They could even retrieve “EdStone”from the flowerbeds at The Ivy’s Cha restaurant and use the other side to carve out their vision for “a Greater Britain” blah blah blah.But let’s face it, give or take a few noble exceptions, who now believes a word any mainstream politician says It’s been reported that the Prime Minister is planning to announce a raft of new policy proposals, presumably to reassure us that she’s a leader.Forget it, Theresa. No one’s listening any more.Despite the grand EU project visibly starting to unravel in other member countries, you blinked first in negotiations and consequently have presided over the UK’s biggest betrayal of democracy in modern times.Put on your rambling boots and go for a nice long walk in to the sunset. We wish you well.In the meantime, the rest of us have an important job to do in tomorrow’s polling booths.When that Monty Python-esque giant foot descends to pop the Westminster bubble, it will be glorious to behold and, hopefully, show the next generation of leaders — whatever their political persuasion — that not only is people power still alive, it’s enthusiastically kicking.MY youngest didn’t catch chicken pox until she was , and it was brutal.She was covered in hundreds of angry blisters, needed two weeks off school and was left with a permanent scar on her forehead where the mothership of the virus had resided.One glance at the actors currently starring on our HD TV screens will confirm that she’s not alone.So when I later discovered there was a vaccine that could have prevented all the angst, I felt I had failed as a parent by not knowing this vital piece of information.The chicken pox vaccine has been part of routine childhood vaccinations in the US since , but not in the UK.Now all that may change with news that government scientists are “considering” a national campaign to vaccinate all babies against this disease. What’s to consider America and Australia have programmes that prove it’s safe and effective – thereby ensuring no kids have to go through what my daughter endured.So bring it on. And in the meantime,your child hasn’t yet had chicken pox, I’d think very seriously about finding the £ to get it done privately.IN the “mother’s occupation” section of son Archie’s birth certicate, Meghan Markle put “Princess of the United Kingdom”. She’s lucky she was even asked.When my oldest daughter was born in , the father’s section asked for name, place of birth and occupation.The mother’s part didn’t bother with the last bit – the insinuation being that either we didn’t work or what we did for a living was regarded as irrelevant.I was so irritated by it that I instructed the registrar to squeeze in the word “journalist” next to my name.So I’m glad to see that this inequality has now been addressed.EVERY Christmas, a staple of Moore Towers is a tin of Quality Street that barely makes it through to Boxing Day before being devoured . . . with the exception of the ghastly strawberry and orange cremes.We’re a toffee family, you see, and I have several replacement fillings to prove it.Yet when I posted this photo on Instagram at New Year, along with the caption: “Am so desperate for chocolate I’m considering one of the ‘cremes’ no one ever wants,” it prompted hundreds of comments from all you fans of the squishy ones. Weirdos.To make matters worse, maker Nestle has just announced that the toffee deluxe will be axed for good, replaced by some ghastly “chocolate caramel brownie” nonsense.No, no, NO. I might even start a petition.In the meantime, send me your unwanted toffees.

Professor Alston wrote a similar report saying much the same thing just last November.A year ago, it was the turn of the UN’s absurdly named Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms Of Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance to put the boot into Britain, claiming that Brexit had sparked “explicit racial, ethnic and religious intolerance”.Those were the words of Professor Tendayi Achiume, a Zambian who teaches law at the University of Calornia at Los Angeles.If she wants to witness some racial tension she could, of course, just poke her nose out of her faculty window and observe what is going on in the US, where last year police shot dead , people — with black people twice as likely to be killed as white people.Yet it is always Britain which is singled out for condemnation. It is a disgraceful way for the UN to treat its fth-biggest contributor.This year, Britain will pay £million into the UN’s ­coffers — . per cent of its total budget, in spite of Britain ­having less than one per cent of the world’s population.By contrast, the UN has developed a habit of pouring praise on the governments of some of the world’s most wretched countries.While Venezuela has descended into the mire, UN figures have held it up as a shining example.In , the President of the UN General Assembly said: “What Venezuela has achieved with regards to the Millennium Development Goals should serve as a model for all other countries.”Then last week, delegates at the UN Human Rights Council inexplicably poured praise on North Korea — yes, Kim Jong-un’s North Korea with its public executions and forced-labour camps.The UN has become a strange world of inverted ­values where dictators are held up as heroes while democracies such as Britain are condemned.This perhaps has something to do with the fact many of the  states recognised by the UN are themselves lousily governed. Around  are outright dictatorships and another  have elements of dictatorship.UN officials love giving a poke in the eye to Britain — which was once, of course, colonial master to many of these countries.But there is another reason why Britain tends to show up badly in UN reports. It is easy for their special rapporteurs to pick through data on Britain because we are scrupulous about keeping it.When, for example, Professor Alston claims Britain has million people living in ­“poverty”, he is quoting an experimental measure of financial wellbeing developed by the Government only last year — and including things such as childcare costs, which have never previously been taken into account.Similarly, the claim about .million people in “destitution” comes from a report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation measuring the number of people who find themselves temporarily unable to meet bills for their basic needs.It is hardly to be compared with genuine destitution, where people suffer permanent ­hunger, lack of shelter and fresh water.True, there are many people in Britain who struggle ­financially — but official ­poverty ­figures are relative.We define as poor anyone who has a household income below  per cent of the “median” household income.By way of example, in – median household income in the UK was £ per week before housing costs while “mean” — or typical — household income was £.Yet many people who qualy as “poor” in Britain would be considered very well off in many parts of the world, where incomes are generally much lower.As for Professor Alston’s claim that our Government has destroyed the welfare state, this is nonsense.According to the Office for Budgetary Responsibility, £billion will be spent on the welfare state this year — taking into account state health and education as well as benefits.Of this, £billion will be spent specically on social ­security payments — excluding the state pension.While spending has remained pretty flat over the past decade, when adjusted for inflation it is still signicantly higher than it was  years ago.As for the number of households officially living in ­poverty, that has been pretty flat over the past decade, too.But because we use a ­relative measure of poverty, the poverty line is drawn at a higher level than it was ten years ago.All this seems to have passed Professor Alston by.He seems simply to have vacuumed up the propaganda of left-wing academics and campaign groups who would always cry out for more to be spent on welfare, no matter how much is already being spent.On reflection, though, I think there is scope for the Government to spend an extra £million a year onBritain’s poor — by redirecting the money we send annually to the UN.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If not, whichever party has the most votes then gets the seat instead.The original vote count of the largest party in each round is ided by one plus the total number of seats they have already been allocated, until all the seats for the region have been handed out.Although the method is considered to be one of the most constant and representative forms of voting, the results do not exactly reflect the votes, as this would lead to parties winning fractions of seats.EU voters go to the polls every five years to elect Members of the European Parliament .Each country has a specic number of seats based on their population size.The smallest is Malta and they have six seats, whereas the largest is Germany with .There are  MEPs in total and the UK has .Candidates can stand independently or with a party.They will represent a region of their country, and the number of MEPs for each region depends on population.The government confirmed the country would be taking part in the EU elections in early May after May administration was forced to push back the date it was leaving the bloc because MPs could not get a majority for her withdrawal agreement.As the UK was still in the EU at the time of the elections it is forced to take part even though the majority of voters said they wanted to leave in the referendum vote.The UK went to the polls to elect MEPs on May , .The vote is said to have cost around £million to hold.If a Brexit deal is agreed before the election date or soon after then the UK’s MEPS will not take their seats.Butthat doesn’t happen then the newly elected MEPs will take their place in the European Parliament – which sits in Brussels and Strasbourg - in early July.European Council President Donald Tusk has said that MEPs could sit for “months or even longer”the negotiations drag on.At this stage, how long the UK MEPs will continue to sit is anyones guess.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Treachery amid the herbaceous borders.Boris Johnson and David Davis resigned at the stitch-up because vicar’s daughter May had behaved atrociously.Same this week. She held a long meeting with Cabinet ministers to agreeon one course of action.Off sauntered Mrs May to make a speech proposing a markedly dferent course of action — a concession on a second EU referendum.You can’t blame Andrea Leadsom for quitting in fury.  When a PM goes rogue like that, anger is legitimate. Actually, it becomes necessary.Theresa May, a former bank worker and local councillor, entered the Commons in .Her Maidenhead seat had such a hefty “True Blue” majority that she felt she never needed to fear the voters.From the outset it was obvious that this slender, slightly bloodless backbencher would prosper. Not that she made brilliant speeches. Good heavens no. But she had that sheen of apparent competence that today’s managers have made their own.Youthful Theresa spoke the bland bureaucratic lingo and she did so with safely modulated rhythms. She never led, never resisted. She had Establishment printed all over her.She did politics the way the Tunnock’s factory makes tea-cakes. Everything was tidily wrapped. The outer coating was tempting. It was only when you bit into it that you realised how insubstantial she was.As Tory chairman in  she made a conference speech telling activists they were regarded as “the nasty party”.This created a sensation, London commentators saying she was right to shake shires Tories out of their delusions.But the volunteers, driven more by a sense of honour than clever-clever strategy, felt insulted. May had scored an own goal and weakened her political base. It was a mistake she would repeat as PM.She never suspected that speech would cause such a stink. Instead of revelling in her new-found prominence, she retreated to obscurity.Some politicians are always on the hunt for headlines. Not May. Anti-populism was more her thing. She became known as “Submarine May”, seldom surfacing, seldom making radio contact with high command, just prowling the deep.In the long years of Tory opposition she was shadow secretary of state for education, transport, local government, environment, culture and pensions and shadow leader of the Commons. “Shadow” was indeed the word.She was at best a penumbral figure. In none of these briefs did she do anything radical.Tory leaders kept her because she did not make gaffes, was sleaze-free her marriage to stockbroker Philip, one year her junior, was enviably strong and because every front bench needs a few bores.The occasional dullard makes the bright ones feel better about themselves.Her low-key approach was fine as a mere frontbencher, even as Home Secretary.She waded dutully through her red boxes. Once or twice she showed a sliver of political ankle. With the encouragement of Fleet Street, she blocked the extradition to the US of computer hacker Gary McKinnon.It surprised her boss, David Cameron, as much as anyone.May had kept the matter tightly to herself, chewing on it alone. She took on the Police Federation, whose leaders at that time probably deserved squashing a bit.Her longevity at the Home Office started to become part of her appeal. May was a stayer in a tricky job. So said everyone. Maybe she started to believe she was indestructible.Was she clever  Not startlingly so. But she was dogged.She was never caught out by a question of detail. In the ‘chillaxed’ Cameron government, that made her unusual.Not an easy colleague, though. She feuded with George Osborne and Michael Gove. A more silken operator would have smoothed down such squabbles.Come the EU referendum of , the submarine went into a deep e.May had been thought to be a closet Eurosceptic and the Camerons were relieved when she came out in support of Remain. That was about the last they saw of her.Mind you, given her uselessness at campaigning — which became so painfully apparent in  — they were lucky.If she had fronted any Remain rallies, the Leave vote might have gone even higher.Some accused her of cowardice in hiding from the fray but it meant that when Cameron quit, and leadership contenders contrived to blow their chances, May was acceptable as Brexit Britain’s new PM.“Brexit means Brexit and we’re going to make a success of it,” she claimed.  Her time at No  has, at times, been hard to watch.Worst moment was probably that  conference speech when her voice failed. What a farce that was.Her descent has been dizzyingly fast. In February , the Tories won the Copeland by-election. That was the high-water mark.Days later she went walking in Snowdonia and called a snap election. She went into the campaign  points ahead in the polls. And she blew it.Was it cockiness  Her lack of elan  Her turgid “strong and stable” slogan Okay, we Brits like an underdog but the Tories and Labour had promised to honour the Leave result and we naively believed them. Whatever the reason, May lost.From that moment her power shrivelled. She did have some merits. Her physical stamina, particularly for a diabetic, has been remarkable. Downing Street under her was much freer of shysters and crooks than it was in the Blair and Cameron years.She did not send loads of cronies to the Lords. She was polite, unlike phone-chucker Brown. She was uninterested in the shallow, celebrity world and continued to attend church most Sundays, even when political hassles were at their worst.There was seriousness about her, certainly. Yet that lack of vanity and modern vibes, on one level so honourable, became a handicap. Politics is salesmanship. If you can create an aura of excitement, it helps you to sell policies.May just bored the smalls off us. And she surrounded herself with inadequates. Some of her ministers were rank D-listers. The civil servants seized power and the electorate’s will went ignored.Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill may have thought he was helping her but in his sly attempt to bypass Brexit he has killed his mistress.For a woman so often hailed as stubborn, she proved a terrible pushover in the dealings with Brussels.And the “Bloody dficult woman”, as Ken Clarke called her, was equally feeble in standing up to Remainer ministers like Philip Hammond and Greg Clark.Was she incompetent  Or did shewant the softest of EU exits all along  Certainly looks that way.She might have got away with it had Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party not leapt out of nowhere. That has put that fear of bejaysus up Tory and Labour MPs.Mrs May might never had felt much need to heed the electorate but MPs in marginal seats are more alert to public sentiment.And public sentiment is now molten against May. Her premiership was only about Brexit. No other policy had a look-in.Her inability to deliver that central mission makes the verdict brutal but unavoidable: This stonewall warrior, secretive, robotic, dithery in an age that demands wit and clarity, was, as a PM, the most monumental dud.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

but working one day fewer.Reduced hours are highly correlated with lower emissions, and they also yield improvements in worker well-being, gender equity, and productivity, she said.We are making the case for a reduction in working time without a reduction in pay, Aidan Harper of the NEF told New Scientist.The group claimed working between  and  hours a week was bad for both mental and physical health.Feel like you spend your le at the office  Well, you do we spend more time there than anyone  in EuropeDenmark works the shortest week, clocking in just  hours,  minutes.Scientists from the Australian National University have found that you can work up to  hours a week before it starts to have a detrimental effect on you.Were in the middle of stress crisis in this country right now, with  per cent of Brits saying that theyd felt overwhelmed and unable to cope at some point in the past year.For --year-olds, that figure shoots up to  per cent.So its hardly a wonder that were crying out for more time off.But its not just the immediate health issues that come with working so much that could be improved.Experts also believe that were ruining the environment by working so much.Scientists from Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden found that introducing a four-day week could cut emissions by  per cent.The main reason wed release fewer ozone-layer-damaging emissions is because wed have less income to spend on environmentally unfriendly stuff.But also, wed be driving less and potentially using less electricity needed to power offices and businesses.While the report calls for wages to remain the same regardless of office hours, nearly  per cent of Brits say that theyd be willing to take a pay cut infor more free-time.In January, a poll found that  per cent of Brits wanted a four-day working week.At a time when wealthy countries must achieve rapid reductions in carbon emissions, there is no better way to supplement energy policy with a new approach to work time, Juliet Schor, Professor of Sociology at the University of Boston wrote in the report.Prof Schor previously called for the hours we work each week to be cut from  to .In , the NEF advised the UK government to follow the lead of Belgium, where workers have the right to request shorter hours and an increase in the minimum wage.At the time, the NEF said that it was time to make the part-time the new full-time."},{"url":null,"title":"ex paras turn up to guard army veteran","story":"Don MacNaughton, , an Armed Forces veteran who was drenched in the drink by a childish yob, was later flanked by two of his former comrades as he campaigned in Aldershot, Hampshire.The vets, wearing regimental T-shirts, were spotted supporting Mr MacNaughton, also an ex-Paratrooper, yesterday evening as he helped voters in the European Elections.But Don hadn’t seen his old comrades since leaving the army and they turned up out of the blue after the milkshake attack.Don told Sun Online: “We were mates together in the army.

Le depends on compromise.He was right.As we strive to find the compromises we need in our politics – whether to deliver Brexit, or to restore devolved government in Northern Ireland – we must remember what brought us here.Because the referendum was not just a call to leave the EU but for profound change in our country.A call to make the United Kingdom a country that truly works for everyone. I am proud of the progress we have made over the last three years.We have completed the work that David Cameron and George Osborne started: the deficit is almost eliminated, our national debt is falling and we are bringing an end to austerity.My focus has been on ensuring that the good jobs of the future will be created in communities across the whole country, not just in London and the South East, through our Modern Industrial Strategy.We have helped more people than ever enjoy the security of a job.We are building more homes and helping first-time buyers onto the housing ladder - so young people can enjoy the opportunities their parents did.And we are protecting the environment, eliminating plastic waste, tackling climate change and improving air quality.This is what a decent, moderate and patriotic Conservative Government, on the common ground of British politics, can achieve - even as we tackle the biggest peacetime challenge any government has faced.I know that the Conservative Party can renew itself in the years ahead.That we can deliver Brexit and serve the British people with policies inspired by our values.Security freedom opportunity.Those values have guided me throughout my career.But the unique privilege of this office is to use this  to give a voice to the voiceless, to fight the burning injustices that still scar our society.That is why I put proper funding for mental health at the heart of our NHS long-term plan.It is why I am ending the postcode lottery for survivors of domestic abuse.It is why the Race Disparity Audit and gender pay reporting are shining a light on inequality, so it has nowhere to hide.And that is why I set up the independent public inquiry into the tragedy at Grenfell Tower – to search for the truth, so nothing like it can ever happen again, and so the people who lost their lives that night are never forgotten.Because this country is a Union.Not just a family of four nations.But a union of people – all of us.Whatever our background, the colour of our skin, or who we love.We stand together.And together we have a great future.Our politics may be under strain, but there is so much that is good about this country. So much to be proud of. So much to be optimistic about.I will shortly leave the job that it has been the honour of my le to hold – the second female Prime Minister but certainly not the last.I do so with no ill-will, but with enormous and enduring gratitude to have had the opportunity to serve the country I love.Mrs May had been warned thatshe didnt quit today, Sir Graham would start the process to force her out through a new no-confidence vote.And Cabinet ministers threatened to bring down the Governmentthe PM didnt abandon her attempts to force through the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.Meanwhile the Tories face a near-total wipeout when the Euro election results are announced on Sunday night.This morning Mrs May faced one final blow to her authority as Helen Grant resigned as Tory party vice-chair, saying she wants to be involved in the leadership race by backing Dominic Raab.The Prime Minister wanted her legacy to be taking Britain out of the EU, before turning to the burning injustices of UK society.Instead she will remembered for her stubborn refusal to compromise and inability to unite her party.Her last-ditch bid to save the Brexit deal by offering MPs a vote on whether to hold a second referendum proved the last nail in her coffin, triggering a Cabinet rebellion with Andrea Leadsom resigning.Mrs Mays resignation will kickstart a furious race to replace her with Boris Johnson the favourite to take over.Mr Raab, Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove are also considered frontrunners - but as many as  Tory MPs could throw their hats in the ring.Today Mr Hunt confirmed hes planning to run for No while in a surprise move Sir Graham quit his  Committee position to launch his own run for the leadership.The leadership election is set to be hugely isive for the Tory party with the two dferent wings attacking each other over what should happen next with Brexit.The Prime Minister will formally stand down as party leader on June  - but will stay in place while the new PM is being chosen, rather than handing over to an interim chief such as David Lidington.The leadership contest, overseen by party chairman Brandon Lewis, will take around six weeks.Any Tory MP can enter the race, and the list of contenders is then whittled down by the parliamentary party.MPs vote in multiple rounds, eliminating one candidate each time until just two are left.The partys , activists then choose behind the final shortlist of two, with the winner declared leader and Prime Minister.When Mrs May became leader, she didnt have to submit to a vote of members because Andrea Leadsom pulled out of the race.So the last time activists have had a say on the leadership was , when David Cameron defeated David Davis.Today top Brexiteer Steve Baker insisted the next leader must be someone who is fully committed to our EU departure and ready to leave with No Deal.Jacob Rees-Mogg added: A new leader can get us out of the EU on October , that is in law.

And shes likely to be remembered as one of the worst Prime Ministers of recent decades.And many of the qualities most admired in her - her stubborn nature, her refusal to play Westminster games - eventually proved her downfall.Mrs Mays le was scarred with tragedy at a young age as she lost both her parents within a short period in her s.The double sadness brought her closer to husband Philip - who has always been by far her most important confidant.From her time at Oxford, the future PM was known as fiercely ambitious and she has admitted she was aiming for No from the very start.After a career in banking, Mrs May became MP for Maidenhead in , serving on the frontbench under William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard.She rose to public fame in , when as Tory chair, she admitted that many voters saw them as the nasty party.David Cameron made her his Home Secretary, a job she held for six years to widespread acclaim.Mrs May was known for staying out of the political horse race, unlike the master manipulator George Osborne.She backed Remain ahead of the  referendum - but spoke at barely any events, meaning she was never closely identied with the pro-EU cause.That meant she was perfectly placed to swoop in after David Camerons resignation, leaving rivals such as Boris Johnson and Michael Gove humiliated.Mrs May vowed: Brexit is Brexit, and were going to make a success of it.She sacked Mr Gove and Mr Osborne - telling the Chancellor he needed to get to know the party better.The PM struck a tough line on Brexit, vowing to withdraw from the EUs single market and customs union and insisting: No Deal is better than a bad deal.She was hailed as the new Iron Lady as supporters welcomed her tough rhetoric towards Brussels.Mrs May triggered Article  - the legal process taking Britain out of the EU - in March . But when talks with the EU started it became clear she had never worked out a coherent position on how to leave, nor had she gathered a Commons majority for her Brexit vision.And despite her No Deal rhetoric - which drove Remain voters away - Brussels never really believed she was willing to walk away from the talks.Things were made even worse by the  snap election, called when Mrs May had a -point lead in the polls.The campaign was laser-focused on her personality, so her wooden style alienated voters and in the end she lost her majority.Things went from bad to worse over the next two years: Brexiteers were alienated by every fudge, while Remainers started campaigning ever more loudly for a second referendum. Rather than uniting both camps, it seemed neither group really trusted her.And despite her warning to George Osborne, it emerged that Mrs Mays refusal to get involved in the Westminster gossip circuit meant she was out of touch with her MPs and had little support base to fall back on.More than  ministers ended up quitting the Government, more than under any previous PM in such a short time.Mrs May finally agreed a Brexit deal with the EU in November last year. Although it always looked tricky, the Prime Minister put up a tough fight and in many ways grew in the eyes of the public.But while some admired her resilience and dedication, others criticised her for refusing to contemplate any way forward other than pushing ahead with the withdrawal agreement.The first meaningful vote was the worst defeat suffered by any Prime Minister in history, with more than  Tories rebelling against her.For most of her own MPs, the last straw came when she agreed to delay Brexit following the third defeat of her deal in the Commons. They accused her of bowing to Remainers in the Cabinet who are desperate to block No Deal, and sucking up to Labour by opening talks with Jeremy Corbyn.And this week dealt the final death knell to Mrs Mays career. She wanted to give her deal a last push - but instead MPs made it clear she should go as soon as possible.Her time in office was so consumed with Brexit that she wasnt able to push through much signicant action in other areas.But despite that, she could never actually deliver Brexit.Even Tory MPs now say that Mrs May will forever be remembered as one of the worst Prime Ministers ever.A sense of duty was never enough to make up for her lack of vision - and failure to lead."},{"url":null,"title":"how hold dog lead injury uk","story":"Fractures, lacerations, dislocated and even shortened fingers are among the wounds frequently reported after peaceful walks became painful.Along with the trauma, some injuries can take up to a year to properly recover from, surgeons say.In just one year, the Royal Cornwall Hospital NHS Trust alone treated  serious hand injuries caused by dog lead or collar misuse, the British Society for Surgery of the Hand reported.Medics were forced to deglove Jilian Tisdales finger after her dogs lead wrapped around her middle fingers and ripped off some of the soft tissue.The -year-old recalls feeling a terrible pain like a filleting kne.After surgery, she has been left with a shorter middle finger.And experts fear many more could be suffering in silence, enduring long-term hand damage so they can spend more time with their pets.Consultant surgeon Rebecca Dunlop, from Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro, told the Daily Mail: Dogs have a wide range of health benefits for their owners, including reducing stress and helping people stay active.But having seen many serious injuries caused by dog leads and collars, I want dog lovers to be aware of the simple steps they can take to avoid severe damage to their hand.We want to ensure that dog owners are able to carry on enjoying time with their dogs without risking damage to their hand and time in hospital.Ms Dunlop said a particularly common injury caused by dog collars and leads is spiral fractures of the finger bones, which often need an operation to fix.Long-term hand damage can be caused when people dislocate their fingers by hooking them under their dogs collar before the dog lurches or makes a sudden movement."},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry italy polo meghan archie home","story":"The Duke of Sussex jetted into Rome for the posh polo bash that will raise funds for vulnerable children in southern Africa.The match saw the new dad play on the Sentebale St. Regis team captained by Sentebale Ambassador Nacho Figueras, against a US Polo Assn team that will be captained by Malcolm Borwick.Mr Figueras, who was a guest at Harrys wedding, was asked how the duke was coping with a new baby, and replied: Hes doing great.

We’ve done a lot of work to optimise airspace.”Forecasters expect the weekend to start off dry and bright in most regions before turning cooler.Getaways are expected to peak on Saturday with . million trips, according to the RAC survey of , UK drivers.Major roads are likely to be busiest between am and pm that day, suggesting motorists should set off as early as possible to avoid congestion.Routes leading to the coasts and national parks could see the worst traffic.Highways England said it was removing more than  miles of roadworks ahead of the weekend, meaning % of motorways and major A-roads in England will be free of cones.Met Office deputy chief meteorologist Chris Bulmer said: At the moment Saturday looks to be one of the better days of the weekend with the promise of sunshine for most, whereas Sunday will be cloudier with outbreaks of rain moving in from the west.By Monday this rain and cloud should clear with ato sunny spells and the odd shower in places, feeling cooler across the country in the fresh westerly breeze.RAC patrol of the year Ben Aldous said: When warmer weather coincides with traffic jams, its particularly important that every driver is confident their car can keep its cool to avoid a breakdown.So we strongly recommend lting the bonnet to check the coolant is at the right level, andits not, to either top up or visit a good local garage to get it checked out.Rail passengers also face disruption over the coming days as Network Rail carries out ious engineering projects.Signicant work on the West Coast Main Line will see changes to services between London Euston and Cumbria throughout the weekend.Sections remaining open will see longer journeys, fewer available seats and may require rail replacement buses.The disruption is due to the replacement of track sections and overhead electric cables, as well as maintaining bridges, tunnels and trackside equipment.Martin Frobisher, managing director of Network Rails London North Western route, said: We recognise there is never an ideal time to shut the railway for our must-do work.Bank holidays are the least disruptive time to do it, when fewer passengers use the railway compared to the working week.

Thank you for your stoical service to our country and the Conservative Party. It is now time to follow her urgings: to come together and deliver Brexit.Boris was one of the first to declare he would actually be running for the top job, saying of course hell be going for it.The ex-Foreign Secretary is the bookies favourite and likely to win over the Eurosceptic members too.But hes less popular among Tory MPs and will have to work hard to make it down to the final two.His Brexiteer credentials and natural flair and popularity will do well to boost his case.Boris also tried to work in Government but quit after Mrs Mays deal was published last year, giving him a clear edge over Remainers who dont support our EU exit.Quite a way behind Boris in the leadership race is fellow Brexiteer Dominic Raab, who quit as Brexit Secretary over the PMs finalised Brexit deal.The ex-minister has been arguing for a clean Brexit ever since, and has demanded the PM go back to the EU and negotiate more on the hated Northern Ireland backstop.Hes already saidhe were elected then he would shave a penny off income tax to help working Brits, and would fight for tougher employment rights for mums.Hes said a No Deal wouldnt be the end of the world for Britain either.And hes got the backing of his predecessor in the job too, David Davis.The Environment Secretary has achieved a remarkable turnaround since kning Boris Johnson during the  leadership contest.His support among party members dropped through the floor and it seemed his chances were gone for ever.But Mr Gove, who led the Leave campaign in the EU referendum, has rebranded himself as an ecowarrior as Environment Secretary.He has also thrown his full support behind Theresa Mays Brexit plan, winning him friends among MPsnot the party faithful.The now ex-Commons leader will be seeing a boost to her leadership credentials after resigning over the PMs new Brexit deal.The Brexiteer was cheered when she dramatically quit on Thursday evening as the PM fought to cling on in No.Mrs Leadsoms run for the leadership of the Tory party once before, going up against Mrs May in .But she was forced to withdraw from the race when she appeared to suggest she would make a better PM because she had kids.She was brought into the PMs Cabinet as environment secretary and Commons leader before she quit.Mrs Leadsom also had a role in the downfall of Sir Michael Fallon after she accused him of lewd sexual comments.The Home Secretary ended up backing Remain during the EU referendum but is popular among the Tory parliamentary party.Mr Javid was appointed to his role in the wake of the Windrush scandal and the resignation of Amber Rudd.Hes been keen to show he will be tough on crime and terror - notably for revoking the citizenship of Isis bride Shamima Begum.A known Eurosceptic, some of his statements in recent months and his backing for a harder Brexit have been taken as signs he is keen to make a serious pitch for the top job.The MP for Bromsgrove in Worcestershire is a former managing director at Deutsche Bank.The Health Secretary tried to break the ice in a crunch Cabinet meeting earlier this week by turning up with a packet of waffles.Hes already raked in £, in donations from digital tech entrepreneurs, The Sun revealed this week.And hes won admirers for his positive and optimistic brand of conservatism and his track record of getting things done.Another female Brexiteer to watch out for is Penny Mordaunt.Shes just been promoted to Defence Secretary after Gavin Williamson was sacked earlier this month, which is fitting as she is a Navy reservist.Previously the former Splash! contestant ran the Department for International Development.A popular junior minister in the Justice department, Mr Stewarts recently been promoted to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for International Development.Hes been fiercely loyal to the PM in her hour of need, taking to the airwaves to defend her at every opportunity.Hea got an incredibly ies background - from serving in the British Army to working as a diplomat in Kosovo and Iraq.

The very best light entertainment of the television week. And also the very worst.It set off at a cracking pace, though, with “The Albanian Kirstie Allsopp”, the Icelandic sex gimps and Serhat, a dentist from San Marino, who wrote his song in five minutes , all getting what they deserved from commentator Graham Norton, who reserved particular venom for the Slovenian “Avatars”, Zala Kralj and Gasper Santi.“Romantic or creepy, you decide.” Three very unsettling minutes later . . .  “Creepy, I’ve decided. Free the Slovenian one.”The four pretty awful Israeli hosts weren’t safe from Norton either. Particularly not model Bar Refaeli, who was on the sharp end of it when she asked an extremely “relaxed-looking” Jean Paul Gaultier, backstage, what he looked for in a muse.“She ’az to ’ave person-al-ity.”“Well don’t go looking for it in Bar then.”We had hosts, acts and commentator all working in perfect disharmony, in other words, and,you’d asked me just before half time, I’d have placed a lot of money on it being a vintage Eurovision Song Contest.You may have your own reasons why those bets were abandoned long before that dreary entry from The Netherlands was declared the winner, including excessive running time, the whf of voting foul play from the usual Greek Cypriot suspects, and Britain’s Michael Rice finishing last, but I’m pinning it all on the half-time turn, Madonna.She very clearly thought she was doing Eurovision a massive favour just by turning up.We just as clearly could hear it was actually Eurovision which was doing Madonna the service, eventhey had forgotten to fit her a chairlt. Or an auto-tuner.Or bothered checking to seeshe was secretly working as part of a Hamas sleeper cell. Because, in all my long years of watching and enjoying this barmy old event, I have never seen someone suck so much le from the room. Audience and viewers were both gone in the space of ten minutes.So too was Graham Norton, who might not have had his chat show booker’s head on, but he certainly spared her blushes, made no reference to the fruit ’n’ nutcase music and didn’t even point out Madonna’s parting “WAKE UP” shot was pretty wishful thinking having comatosed half the continent.A shame. An event like Eurovision needs him to apply the same levels of brutality to everyone who deserves them, including superstars and the  exhibitionist berks from the national voting juries who try to make the night all about them.By the time the evening got round to that point, though, Norton was either too tired or too busy belly-aching about the night’s big casualty.“That’s awful. Our hearts go out to Michael.” Michael  Michael will be fine.It’s the mad old American bat who you thought had “conjunctivitis” who’s really screwed.GOOD Morning Britain, Piers Morgan on THAT magazine front cover: “To put it in context, she’s lb heavier than me and she’s  inches smaller. And that’s a body- positive image ”No, that’s Mikumi, Whipsnade Zoo’s white rhino.ANOTHER reason for Line Of Duty’s incredible popularity  It didn’t despise more than half its potential audience. Something you’d think would be the default setting of most mainstream TV drama.But it’s the exact opposite, as you’ll have discoveredyou watched BBC’s Years And Years, which, according to Auntie’s continuity moron, was “written by the modern- day genius that is Russell T Davies”, who’s caught here somewhere between Doctor Who and Queer As Folk, while probably wishing he’d written Our Friends In The North.So we’re vaulted into the near future with a bunch of insufferable heart-bleeders called the Lyons family, who’ve ticked every box in the Beeb’s manual, mixed race, disabled, gay, “trans-human”, and like to appear concerned about Palestine, poverty and a bunch of freshly-arrived Ukrainian refugees, who look about as Ukrainian as the front three floats at the Rio carnival.The only people who don’t fulfil the usual PC criteria, in fact, are the exclusively white members of a right-wing populist movement, led by Emma Thompson, who plays the role of Viv Rook with a northern, working-class accent, just to put as much distance as possible between herself and her character.Whether you think she’s the smuggest hypocrite on the planet, though, she’s really good and very occasionally Years And Years’ dialogue absolutely sings.Most of the first episode, though, Davies was just parading his own political prejudices and engaging in BBC wish fulfilment as he torpedoed us through the years  to .So the bad news was thatDonald Trump started a nuclear war with China. The even worse news  Have I Got News For You still seems to be going in . Roll on Armageddon.Clinton Morrison: “Berardi lost his head in a split second in five seconds.”GAME Of Thrones was a brilliantly imaginative, daring, funny, stylish, mood-capturing television production which arguably changed the face of TV for the better. But the greatest television show of all time  Do me a favour. It’s not even the best show currently on Sky Atlantic .A purely personal opinion, obviously, that I’ll happily admit owes a lot to my own staggering lack of imagination and the presence of dragons, which stopped me ever giving too much of a toss over who sat on the Iron Throne.It’s also down to the mixed quality of the writing, particularly in this disappointing last series, and the acting.Because although there were lots of great performances, like Iain Glen as Jorah Mormont, the dispensable nature of the cast meant none of them were towering, quite a few of them were awfuland the main protagonist, Jon Snow, wore the same slightly aghast expression for the duration.It’s debatable how well GoT will age as well. It has, though, definitely had the good sense to make its exit while the going is still good and left most of the audience wanting more.And should they ever want to watch the greatest TV show of all time again, they can simply type those  letters into their Sky planner: The Sopranos.Every bandwagon-jumping, attention-seeker in the country calling for Love Island to be axed.The very next middle-class t**t who tells me “you must love Fleabag.” .

Here’s a few lines from Theresa May ’s exit speech that sound familiar.  Jeremy Corbyn, speech to Scottish Labour Conference, March  “A strategy to create good, skilled jobs that pay well to encourage manufacturing and the industries of the future. “And to ensure that investment reaches the places that need it most, not just London and the South East.” Theresa May, Today: “My focus has been on ensuring that the good jobs of the future will be created in communities across the whole country, not just in London and the South East , through our modern industrial strategy.”  Jeremy Corbyn, in a speech launching his European elections campaign, May  “ Labour , and only Labour stands on that common ground in this election.” Theresa May, Today: “…a Conservative government on the common ground of politics….”And it wouldn’t be the first time Mrs May’s statements have apparently borrowed from where. Parts of her  speech to Conservative Party Conference bore a striking similarity to a speech delivered by fictional US President Jed Bartlett in the West Wing.Here’s the section from Mrs May’s speech:“It is when tested the most that we reach deep within ourselves and find that our capacity to the challenge before us may well be limitless.”And here’s the speech from the West Wing:“Every time we think we have measured our capacity to meet a challenge, we look up and we’re reminded that that capacity may well be limitless.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dont cry me cruel theresa","story":"NewsopinionDont cry for me, cruel TheresaLet’s weep not for Theresa May.

One way or another, weaposll have a new Prime Minister by the end of July. She tearfully announced the timetable for her resignation in a harrowing speech on the steps of Number . But her inability to convince her own MPs to back her Brexit plan made her departure inevitable. Even before she agreed to go, MPs from Boris Johnson to Amber Rudd were jostling for position to take the top job. So when she finally does go, how will the process to replace her actually work  Hereaposs a handy guide.  Theresa May will officially step down as leader of the Conservative Party on June th. She will remain as aposcaretakerapos Prime Minister until a replacement has been chosen by the Conservative Party.  Under the rules of a Tory leadership race, candidates bidding for the crown must be nominated by just two fellow Conservative MPs. The Party have announced nominations will close in the week commencing June . If there are more than two hopefuls for the party reins , a series of ballots is held. Those rounds of votes are traditionally held on Tuesdays and Thursdays, meaning it could take a few weeks to whittle downthere are a whole string of candidates. The MP receiving the fewest votes is knocked out in each round until only two remain. The Party say this process could continue until the end of June. They go to a run-off of the wider Conservative Party, with its estimated , members eligible to vote. The candidate who wins the most votes becomes the leader. The process will involve a series of hustings around the UK, and voting will take place to allow the result to be confirmed before the Summer recess, which is expected to be the end of July. Does the winner become Prime Minister   Yes, because the Tories are already in government. There is only a general electionthe new Prime Minister decides to hold one, or there is a no confidence vote in the government. MPs can oust the Prime Minister by voting no confidence in Her Majestyaposs Government by a simple majority . If that happens, convention suggests she must resign and nominate a new PM. That PM has  days to win enough support. If they canapost, the new PM must then hold a general election. MPs could also vote directly to hold a general election. This vote, however, would have to pass with a two-thirds majority of all MPs.

And just like her election, it will have profound consequences for Brexit - with a hard-right, Hard Leaver likely to take the reins.

The Old Etonian was one of the key players in the  Leave campaign after a last-minute decision to back Brexit. He resigned from the Cabinet in  in protest at Mayaposs plan. He was tipped as a successor to David Cameron but ruled himself out after Michael Gove stabbed him in the back with a last-minute bid for the top job. Since then heaposs lost weight and had a haircut in what many argued was a pre-leadership bid upgrade. Sure enough he confirmed by telling a business conference: Iaposm going to go for it! Selecting the former mayor of London for eight years would enrage Tory Remainers, who believe he is in this game only for himself and his ego. He became notorious for his attention-grabbing offensive comments, when he called black people piccaninnies, said Barack Obama was part-Kenyan and compared the EU to Adolf Hitler. Heaposs also criticised for vast sums of money he rakes in alongside being an MP for speeches and a £,-a-yearcolumn - which was rapped for inaccuracy by the press regulator. Meanwhile, heaposs been rapped for showing a lack of respect to Parliament by repeatedly breaking Commons rules. Supporters say that since splitting with his long-suffering we Marina Wheeler and shacking up with ex-Tory head of press Carrie Symonds, heaposs mended his ways and become more serious. But scores of Tory MPs would vote for Anyone But Boris and a Scottish operation to stop him was nicknamed Operation Arse. Dominic Raab ODDS:   VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING: .   During his four-month stint as Brexit Secretary, ultra-hard Leaver Dominic Raab suggested he would use leaving the EU to slash business taxes. Now heaposs running for leader heaposs hinted p could be slashed off income tax - cutting billions from the public purse. And that wasnapost all that would anger left-wingers. The -year-old sparked fury in  by saying most food bank users are not languishing in poverty. He claimed: The typical user... is someone who has a cash flow problem. When a disability activist told him people are dying under Tory austerity, he described her calls for cash as a childish wish list. And he put out a pamphlet in  that suggested exempting small firms from minimum wage laws for workers under . Mr Raab positioned himself early on for the leadership, setting out his plans to tackle kne crime with “robust policing” and community work. He also paraded in his home in a cringeworthy interview with his we. And he attempted to outflank hostile competition by addressing claims he used a gagging order, to silence a former colleague who accused him of bullying. Mr Raab told The Sunday Times the claims, which date back to  before he was an MP, were completely ”. Michael Gove ODDS:   VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    The Environment Secretary had a bruising experience in the last Tory leadership race stabbing Boris in the back before finishing third. And he kept his powder dry in the days immediately following Theresa Mayaposs announcement she would quit. But behind the scenes his allies, including Treasury minister Mel Stride, have been approaching MPs in the most unlikely positions to seethey will join his slate. One former Cabinet minister told the Mirror Mr Gove was one of the most likely to be elected. Despite infuriating teachers when he was Education Secretary, and stabbing Boris Johnson in the back for leadership in , the -year-old is seen as a competent media performer and has won plaudits as a campaigner for environmental issues. He has already paraded with his Scottish parents as part of the proxy leadership contest in the party. He was a prominent face in the Brexit campaign, but he isnapost wildly trusted by other figures on the Conservativesapos eurosceptic wing.    Jeremy Hunt ODDS:   VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was a prominent Remainer in the  referendum. And now heaposs even more prominent - loudly positioning himself as a possible leadership contender. Heaposs taken select journalists on a high-profile trip to Africa and appeared in cringeworthily staged photos with his we. Later he made the leadership bid even more obvious by pointedly calling for more defence spending - a sure-fire hit with the Tory grassroots. As Health Secretary, Mr Hunt, , fought a long battle with the medical profession over a new contract for doctorsapos working conditions. The -year-old became Foreign Secretary in July following the resignation of Boris Johnson. He chose not to run in the  leadership contest and instead gave his full support to Mrs May, saying it was not the right time to put his hat in the ring. Mr Hunt made a public sht towards Euroscepticism after the referendum.    Andrea Leadsom ODDS:   VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    The -year-old, grammar-school educated former bank executive is about as true blue Tory as you can get. She survived to the final two of the  Tory leadership race, pitching herself as the Hard Brexit, blue alternative to Theresa May with a cringeworthy march in Westminster. But she infamously pulled out after making controversial remarks about motherhood and trying to deny them. She has said she is seriously considering running for the leadership again. And she played a crucial part in forcing Theresa Mayaposs resignation announcement, after resigning from the PMaposs cabinet and blasting her Brexit plan just hours before the EU elections.    Penny Mordaunt ODDS:   VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    Recently promoted to Defence Secretary, Penny Mordaunt is a -year-old Royal Navy reservist whoaposs only been an MP since  - but has a rich slew of headlines to her name. From bellyflopping on TV ing show Splash! to slashing billions off benefits and lying about Brexit, sheaposs often been famous - and only sometimes for the right reasons. The daughter of a paratrooper and special needs teacher, who has a twin brother, the Portsmouth North MP went to her local comprehensive. She worked in a factory and as a magicianaposs assistant to save up for Reading University, which she was the first member of her family to go to. The PR supremo was director of communications for the National Lottery, head of campaigns for Diabetes UK, head of foreign press for George W Bush’s  and  election campaigns and chief of staff for former MP David Willetts.    Rory Stewart ODDS:   VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    The Hong Kong-born son of a diplomat, an Old Etonian, once admitted his career gives the appearance he was a spy. The -year-old delivered his own child after a career as a diplomat in the Foreign Office. He was elected MP for Penrith and the Border in  and joined the government in . The International Development Secretary wasted absolutely no time after being promoted to the Cabinet in May . He announced his pitch to be PM within hours. Mr Stewart said: I think itaposs important at this time when the Prime Ministeraposs said sheaposs going to step down to have a voice thataposs arguing for being radical. But, radical in the centre of British politics, not radical on the extreme right of British politics. Yet his approach - blindly following the PMaposs Brexit deal and saying it might even be worth splitting the party for - has made him wildly unpopular among Tory Brexiteers.    Sajid Javid  ODDS:   VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    The Home Secretary has spent a few months warming up for a leadership bid. It’s widely expected the next Tory leader will be a Brexiteer. Meaning Mr Javid, , who backed Reman but now supports Leave, would have a real fight on his hands to win round Tory members. He took over at the Home Office after Amber Rudd was forced to quit over the Windrush scandal - and has picked public fights with Mrs May on key issues like immigration and police funding. But his star has fallen over chaotic handling of migrants crossing the Channel. He was accused of stoking tensions by declaring a national emergency to deal with a few hundred migrant crossings over a period of months. Mr Javid, the son of Pakistani bus driver, would be the first non-white Prime Minister. Matt Hancock ODDS:   VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING: .     The ambitious -year-old entered politics as George Osborneaposs adviser and was in the inner circle of the famously cliquey ex-Chancellor. The parkour- and karaoke-loving Conservative entered Parliament in , Government in  and joined the DCMS in July  after Mrs May took over as Prime Minister. He was swtly promoted to Culture Secretary and then Health Secretary. But he came under fire for accepting thousands from the boss of a think tank which wants to scrap the NHS. Within days of the PMaposs announcement, he somehow found his way onto the Good Morning Britain sofa, where he said of leadership: I think you don’t rule out these things.” Then, all but confirming he would run, he posed with a horse. James Cleverly ODDS:   VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    The -year-old Brexiteer is a tub-thumping Tory whoaposs not afraid to go into battle on social media. The MP for Braintree has repeatedly got into spats with Labour since taking his job as Tory Vice Chair. Heaposs a boisterous character at social events and in the bars of Parliament, making up for a lack of Westminster experiencewith fierce public loyalty. Esther McVey  ODDS:   VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:   The hardline Brexiteer confirmed she will be running for the Tory leadership with a pledge to slash £billion from foreign aid, and spend it on schools and the police. The former welfare-slasher and rank outsider said: Iaposve always said quite clearlyI got enough support from colleagues then yes I would, and now people have come forward and I have got that support. But former GMTV presenter Ms McVey became notorious among benefit claimants after working as a Minister and later Secretary of State in the Department for Work and Pensions. Her blunt style drew floods of criticism even when she managed to secure limited extra money for cash-starved Universal Credit, and U-turned on a benefit cut for the disabled.  Over the years, she made a number of controversial comments which turned her into a lightning rod for anger about benefits. She was ousted from her Wirral West seat in  after a sustained campaign against her, but ed in George Osborneaposs ultra-safe Tatton seat in . She made clear that under her leadership Britain would leave the EU on October  - deal or no deal. Amber Rudd ODDS:   VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    Amber Rudd was previously seen as a favourite to replace Mrs May. But as the party has drted to the right the moderate Remainer Ms Rudd had fallen out of favour. She was forced to quit as Home Secretary during the Windrush scandal. But after eurosceptic Esther McVey quit the government, remain-supporting Ms Rudd, , ed to government as Work and Pensions Secretary. She has a tiny majority in her seat of Hastings and Rye, which would make her vulnerable to any co-ordinated insurgency from local Labour backers. The Work and Pensions Secretary gave a wide-ranging speech on  May that called for a st Century approach to work in what many will see as a pitch for the Tory leadership. She said I hope a softening of benefit sanctions show her credentials as a so-called aposOne Nationapos Tory. And she admitted sanctions may have damaged the Tory brand, saying: If there has been damage I hope we can reverse that.  She dodged questions on whether she would throw her hat in the ring for the Tory leadership, saying: “I’m committed to the DWP”.    Liz Truss ODDS:   VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    The Chief Secretary of the Treasury is about as right wing as they come when it comes to economics. The -year-old also loves to tell a joke and hasnapost really hidden her ambition to one day hold the top job. She even posed in Westminster for a photo shoot and an interview with the Sunday Times, calling for £bn to be spent on tax cuts. And she appeared in a series of hair-raising photos with wide-bottomed trousers before giving a speech that ranged far beyond her brief. But disappointing performances in high profile jobs like her time a Justice Secretary has left some MPs questioningshe has what it takes for the top job. She voted to Remain in the referendum - but has since said she would change her mind and became a born-again Brexiteer. Graham Brady ODDS:   VOTED: Leave TRUE BLUE RATING:    The -year-old, made a Sir in , holds Theresa Mayaposs fate in his hands as chairman of the  Committee. The august body runs leadership challenges in the Conservative Party and could change the rules to force Mrs May out. Heaposs currently its premier diplomat in the Tory war, but could reportedly sacrice his immunity to run for the top job himself. The grammar-school-educated MP for Altrincham and Sale West is a former PR man who turned MP in  and was the chief aide to former Tory leader Michael Howard. Tom Tugendhat ODDS:   VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    The privately-educated ex-Army officer only became an MP in  but that hasnapost stopped talk about the leadership. The -year-old has risen to prominence with stinging criticisms of the government from his  as chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee. He could be a figure to unite Remainers and softer Leavers in his warring party - especially the younger flock. But heaposs also an outside chance, and talk has focused more on him teaming up with a bigger beast on a joint ticket. David Gauke  ODDS:   VOTED: Remain TRUE BLUE RATING:    The pro-Remain Justice Secretary is highly unlikely to be putting his hat in the ring. But there is some suggested he could team up with fellow Remainer Amber Rudd to run on a joint ticket. He also gave a wide-ranging speech on Thursday  May straying beyond the confines of his brief. Mr Gauke took a swipe at populists like Boris Johnson saying: Populism would undermine the United Kingdom.  In the context of the United Kingdom, right-wing populism means English nationalism. The biggest problem with populist policies is that too often, they’re just plain wrong.

There was the vicar’s daughter with a strong sense of public duty who wanted to do her best for the country. And there was the plastic Thatcher act the dogmatic Tory who understood the world only through the prism of her Home Counties upbringing. In the end she failed to live up to either role. Her premiership limped to its sad end because, ultimately, she was a mediocre, narrow and unimaginative politician. There was no great vision of where she wanted to take the country and she did not have the statecraft necessary to see through Brexit.    In the end the only quality associated with Mrs May was a plodding resilience and even that had a limited shelf le. All her limitations were there to see from her time in the Home Office. For six years she cocooned herself in the Department fearful of any grand gesture which might attract attention. There were a couple of small but totemic successes - the deportation of Abu Hamza and the Modern Slavery Act - which she clung to as evidence she had used her time effectively. But there was no great reform. The only major policy change was the introduction of Police and Crime Commissioners who the public like so much that barely % turned out to vote from them.    The rest of her legacy from the Home Office was rising numbers in immigration despite the pledge to cap net migration to the tens of thousands and cuts to police numbers which have resulted in a rise in violent crime. The woman who had accused the Tories of being the “nasty party” oversaw the “hostile environment” that led to the Windrush scandal.  By hiding in the Home Office, Mrs May managed to avoid scrutiny over whether she was suited for the top job. Her hallmarks of timidity coupled with political calculation where displayed again during the EU referendum when she did the bare minimum to back the Remain campaign. The person who was to later ask the country to act in the national interest acted in her personal interest by concluding her soft opposition to Brexit would help her win over Tory leave MPs in any leadership campaign.    When the vacancy did emerge in June  Mrs May managed to enter No  without a vote thanks to the incompetence of Boris Johnson, the Treachery of Michael Gove and the inadequacy of Andrea Leadsom. Speaking on the steps of Downing Street for the first time as Prime Minister, Mrs May promised to end the “burning injustices” afflicting Britain. Perhaps she meant it. The intentions may have been noble but as so often with Mrs May the words were never matched by the deeds. On her watch austerity continued, the number of people in absolute poverty continued to rise and rough sleeping has more than doubled. While her domestic agenda proved disappointing, her handling of Brexit was calamitous.  Desperate to keep her party together after the referendum she appointed a string of Brexiteers to key positions for which they were either unworthy or unqualied. Boris Johnson, who had a made a career out of insulting foreigners, was put in the Foreign Office Chris Grayling’s failures as Justice Secretary were rewarded with a gig as Transport Secretary and David Davis was made Brexit Secretary despite his apparent aversion to detail. Then the mistakes began to mount up. In her first conference speech as Prime Minister she set out her unilateral ambition for Brexit based on the red lines of ending freedom of movement and reclaiming sovereignty from European Court of Justice. Within months she triggered Article  without any clear negotiating objective.  She was so confident that she declared we would have a new trade deal with the EU by March . In case anyone was in any doubt this was a Brexit only for the % who voted Leave she insulted Remain voters as being “citizens of nowhere.” She then attempted to sideline Parliament by denying them a vote on Article  only to have to reverse the decision after losing a Supreme Court judgement. All May’s worst traits were on display: she was furtive, distrusting of colleagues and over controlling. Ken Clarke famously dubbed her a “bloody dficult woman”. This was supposed to a back-handed compliment to Mrs May’s obstinacy but it more accurately refers to her inability to communicate and refusal to accept new ideas.  It was never clearher stubbornness was born of resilience or from an absence of imagination. Then she called the General Election after repeatedly saying there would be no snap poll. The disastrous campaign was notable for her “Maybot” performance and the u-turn on the dementia tax after which she forlornly claimed “nothing has changed.” When the election result came in everything did change. She was forced to sack her aides Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, bribe the DUP for its support and sacrice the whip hand on Brexit. A dismal year was capped with her pitul conference speech where in space of an hour she managed to lose her voice, was handed a P by a prankster and suffer the humiliation of the lettering fall off the backstop.  Somehow she managed to soldier on. The red lines on Brexit were erased, ministers resigned in droves and Parliament took back control. In the end Mrs May could hide no longer. Her botched Brexit deal, failure to be candid about its consequences and inability to keep her party united combined to bring about her downfall. Mrs May claimed she never wanted to be remembered for Brexit but it begs the question of why she took the job in the first place given it was inevitably going to dominate her premiership. It was a thankless task but one she asked for.

So what happens now the Plastic Thatcher Act who failed to tackle burning injustices has quit  Once she officially hands in her notice on Friday  June, a sequence of events will be set in train to confirm her replacement. But sheaposll remain Prime Minister for several weeks while that process is carried out. Her successor can take the wheel of Brexit without going to the country - but could be forced to,thereaposs worse deadlock in Parliament. Jeremy Corbyn demanded an immediate general election. Hereaposs what happens when Theresa May quits - and answers to more questions about the aftermath.  Theresa May will officially resign as leader of the Conservative Party on Friday  June. But she will remain caretaker Prime Minister during a Tory leadership contest, which will to start the following week and finish in late July. That means a new Prime Minister will take over just before MPsapos summer recess, three months before the current Brexit deadline of October . Only then will Mrs May stand down as Prime Minister, going to the Queen to formally resign and invite the monarch to nominate her successor. This follows the model of David Cameron, who remained in office during the race to replace him, which Mrs May won in .  Theresa May delayed her decision until after the State Visit to the UK by Donald Trump on June -, and D-Day anniversary events on June . This avoids the unseemly sight of Britainaposs leadership being undermined during a visit by a foreign power. However, past experience tells us that may well not stop Trump throwing a grenade into the debate anyway - perhaps by endorsing a leadership contender like Boris Johnson, who heaposs praised as a future PM before. How will the Conservatives pick the next leader   A leadership contest is expected to take about six weeks. Candidates must be nominated by two sitting Conservative MPs. Firstly, votes are held among Conservative MPs to whittle the field down to two. In each vote, the candidate with the least support is eliminated. These votes will start in the week of June . Traditionally these happen on Tuesdays and Thursdays while Parliament is sitting. But the Toriesapos  Committee - which runs the contest - can shorten these intervals.  Once there are two candidates, they are both put to a ballot of the Tory membership - around , or so people - to choose the new leader. A new leader will be in place before MPsapos summer recess. How does this affect Brexit   Brexit is still due on October  - and the decision to hold a leadership election makes No Deal more likely. Weeks after EU chief Donald Tusk begged us please donapost waste this time, weaposre set to have a new Prime Minister who could steer Brexit in a much harder direction. Tory members are widely expected to elect a Brexiteer Prime Minister who will either try to crash out with no deal, or act the strongman with Brussels to get a better deal. The problem is, not only has Brussels refused to go further - there also simply isnapost a majority for this in Parliament. Her successor will inherit the same deeply ided Parliament, where MPs are implacably opposed to a No Deal Brexit , with no majority without the support of the Northern Irish DUP. Technically No Deal Brexit is the legal default, even though MPs have voted against it. So a new PM could try and plough forward into No Deal, but would face parliamentary mutiny and a constitutional crisis. The paralysis that grips Parliament wonapost disappear just because Theresa May does. Will there be a general election   Not yet, and a new PM can take power without one. But itaposs become more likely all the same. Thataposs because the deadlock in Parliamentwill deepen even furthera hard Brexiteer takes power. The new PM could be forced to try and win a new majority. Or in an extreme situation, the deadlock could push some Tory MPs to vote no confidence in their own government. Last time , a no confidence vote failed by  MPs. Enough defectors and it could pass. Jeremy Corbyn could attempt another no confidence vote in the government after he called for an immediate general election. Itaposd be an uphill struggle as the Toriesapos DUP allies and Change UK have suggested they wonapost back him. But Labouraposs leader said: She cannot govern, and nor can her ided and disintegrating party.  “The Conservative Party has utterly failed the country over Brexit and is unable to improve people’s lives or deal with their most pressing needs. Will there be a second referendum   Itaposs not on the table at the moment. While the forthcoming leadership contest will make calls for it louder, practically, it will also put it on the back burner. Theresa May had offered a parliamentary route to a binding referendum as her final desperate pitch at compromise. That route has now gone up in smoke. Who are the frontrunners to replace Theresa May   Boris Johnson is the favourite - triggering furious machinations among aposmoderateapos or Remainer Tories. Many accept the Marmite-like millionaire wins votes despite being a gaffe-prone offence machine who makes deliberately insulting comments for attention. Remainer Tories are trying to convince Mr Johnson - who backed Brexit in  after great personal turmoil - to steer away from No Deal and promise to negotiate with the EU, so they have a fig leaf of an excuse to support him. It a crowded field and former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Jeremy Hunt are also seen as challengers, with Mr Hunt reportedly Mrs Mayaposs favourite to replace her.   No, sheaposll carry on as an MP, according to her constituency chairman. The Prime Minister rang Richard Kellaway this morning before her resignation statement. He said: “The main concern for us as her association is that she’s not going to resign her seat. She will carry on as a Member of Parliament, which is welcomed by us. “As the Prime Minister, she could go to the House of Lordsshe wants to go that route and carry on, or she could stay a member of Parliament. “Quite clearly, it’s a very troubling and dficult time for her and she’ll need to settle down and see what she wants to do.” Odds on the next Prime Minister Boris Johnson:   Dominic Raab:   Michael Gove:   Jeremy Hunt:   Andrea Leadsom:    Penny Mordaunt:   Rory Stewart:   Sajid Javid:   Matt Hancock:   James Cleverly:   Esther McVey:   Amber Rudd:   Liz Truss:  "},{"url":null,"title":"you not heard man historical","story":"NewsYou may not have heard of this man - but his historical election triumph will affect youNarendra Modi, leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, vowed ato “achhe din” – or good times – and projected himself as the only one who could ensure the nation’s securityShareCommentsByMatt Roper:,  MAY News delivers a speech during a rally ahead of Phase VI of Indias general election in New Delhi on May , . - The Delhi-NCRwill go to the polls on May  during Phase VI of Indias general election.\" content\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _I__oTextTRMRMMGLPICTo.jpg\"It was a historical day \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailYou may not have heard of the man who has just won the largest election in history – but his triumph could affect you in ways you may never imagine. Over six weeks of voting, which ended yesterday, more than  million Indians cast their ballots, using more than . million polling machines and overseen by  million officials. The staggering scale of the operation in the world’s largest democracy was dwarfed only by surprise at the result, a landslide for premier Narendra Modi. Modi, leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, should have faced a ­drubbing at the polls. Joblessness had risen to a -year high under him, along with plummeting incomes for most workers and a damaging slump in industrial production.  But, reflecting of the rise of nationalism worldwide, the -year-old appealed to patriotism and fed on fear. He vowed ato “achhe din” – or good times – and projected himself as the only one who could ensure the nation’s security. In fact many have likened him to another nationalist, US President Donald Trump. While Trump won votes by his tough talk on Mexico, Modi presented himself as the strongman in relations with India’s neighbour Pakistan.  Like Trump, he has been criticised for often distasteful attacks on his rivals or critics. And just like the isive US president, he speak directly to the people through social media. Taking another page out of Trump’s playbook, Modi has also been accused of whipping up nationalist feelings, stoking religious and social tensions and even inciting violence against Muslims and others. During his campaign, Amit Shah, the party’s president, called Muslim migrants who enter the country illegally “termites”. The BJP has also been accused of stoking hysteria against Muslims and low-caste Hindus for not respecting cows– sacred to Hindus. As a result, Hindu mobs have attacked and lynched Muslims for supposedly eating beef. Among BJP candidates elected yesterday with a landslide was Pagya Thakur, accused of plotting a bomb attack on Indian Muslims.  But why should we care that a man like Modi has just become India’s most powerful leader since Indira Gandhi  First, India is expected to become the third largest economy by  .Britain has been counting on our old empire ties to secure a post-Brexit free trade deal, and Theresa May has been busily wooing Modi.But emboldened with the first majority government in India for  years, could Modi take a cue from Trump’s protectionism and block a deal that is good for Britain  Last year he raised import tarfs on  items, including gemstones, jet fuel, plastics, home appliances and shoes, in a bid to protect India’s industries. For Adam Ziegfeld, professor of political science at Temple University, Philadelphia, his landslide win will have “empowered” Modi in trade dealings with Britain and other nations. He said: “It will mean he can focus on economic growth and a muscular foreign policy, making sure India has a wider impact.  “The fact he has raised tarfs on imports gives some idea of the direction he might take.”Another reason it matters who runs India is because it is a nuclear power, involved in along-running conflict in Kashmir. This is behind tension withnuclear-armed Pakistan.The Federation of American Scientists estimates India has between  and  nuclear warheads. It also possesses the technology to send a nuclear warhead , miles on its Agni-V rockets. Many fear that a man who has sabre-rattled about Pakistan now has his finger even more firmly on the nuclear button. Those concerned about the climate crisis should also take heed. India is the third-biggest C polluter. A study in  found it was overtaking China as the largest emitter of sulphur dioxide. Twenty-two of the world’s  most polluted cities are in India. Ziegfeld said Modi will now be “more assertive about his stance that ‘you polluted your way to industrialisation, and now you’re telling us to change ’” Perhaps the most immediate worry, however, is for the ethnic and religious minorities. He said: “A pro-Hindu, anti-Muslim sentiment has run through Indian politics but this is the first time a party has really embraced it. From the point of view of  million Muslims, their victory is not good. “An awful lot of people feel in a very precarious position.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boy 3 trapped arcade grab","story":"NewsBoy, , trapped in arcade claw machine after desperate attempt to win teddyNatalie Draper, , had taken Noah and his twin brother to the play centre in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, when the mischievous tot crawled into the machineShareCommentsByMollie Mansfield:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsNoah managed to squeeze his whole body into the grab machine \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA three-year-old boy became trapped in an arcade claw machine after he desperately tried to get a teddy to take home.

The mum, described in court as her dadaposs blue-eyed girl, said her parents had promised she would be given the farm and last year a judge ordered Jane to pay Lucy over £. million to compensate her for devoting her le to the family holding and the cows.    And Jane lost her appeal against that order today. Lord Justice Lewison said: This is a sad tale of a farming family The Habberfields. In order to raise the cash sum to which the judge held Lucy to be entitled, the whole of the farm would have to be sold. On the face of it, it seems hard that an -year-old woman should leave the house which has been her home for over  years. On the other side of the scale, Lucy was  at the date of trial.    She wanted to begin farming on her own account before it was too late. Without access to the cash award, she would not be able to do so. Lucyaposs expectation was not such as would require her mother to leave the farmhouse. But that expectation was predicated on the continuation of a harmonious family relationship not on the aftermath of a ruinously expensive litigation in which her claim was denied. Although Jane is elderly, she might live for many years. In view of the family breakdown it was also highly desirable for there to be a clean break. The judge heard tensions had been already building between mum Jane, Lucy and her sister Sarah - who a judge found all have a temper - before a scrap between the sisters in a cowshed at -acre Woodrow Farm, near Yeovil, Somerset, pushed things to crisis point.  This led to Lucy storming out of the family holding where she had worked since she was a schoolgirl, and subsequently filing a court claim for the farm she said she was promised. Sarah attended the hearing and backed her elderly mother. But the High Court last year heard Lucy carried out gruelling physical work for long hours with early starts when she was heavily pregnant or had young babies to care for in the s. Lucy told the court she never had a good relationship with her mother.

Once inside they poured petrol over staff and threatened them with a lit matchthey did not reveal the combination numbers of the vault.They were after £.million in cash but instead they found three tonnes of gold bullion as well as diamonds and cash worth the equivalent of £million today. It was dubbed the crime of the century.But there was one big problem - how to spend a gold bar, especially one thataposs obviously stolen.    They enlisted he help of letime criminal Kenneth Noye and fellow villian Brian Reader, who had access to equipment for smelting. He was the reason undercover police officers John Fordham and Neil Murphy were dressed in camouflage clothes and balaclavas outside Noyeaposs Kent mansion months later. Scotland Yard suspected gold was being taken to Noyeaposs estate in West Kingsdown but were unsure how it was being transported to and from the house. The suspicion was that an associate of Noyeaposs, Brian Reader, was involved. Reader was jailed last year for his part in the Hatton Garden jewellery heist and was a friend of Noye. The senior detective who investigated Brink’s-Mat, Brian Boyce, told one reporter that “Reader was trusted by Noye” and was also close to other major crime figures such as the London-based Adams crime family.    When Reader’s home was raided by police they found a book on the diamond underworld, a diamond tester, a diamond gauge, diamond magazines.  The officers had arrived to do the night sht, pm to am and almost immediately, a car turned up and they realised Reader was going in. They moved closer - climbing over the fence and into the grounds of the property - but Noyeaposs three Rottweiler guard dogs started barking at them and pulling at their clothes. Detective Murphy indicated he was going to retreat back to the fence but the officers were then separated. When Det Murphy went back to look for his partner, who was at the time regarded as the countryaposs top undercover policeman, he found him lying a few yards inside the gate having been stabbed  times. At the subsequent murder trial of Noye and Reader the court heard his dying words were  He has done me - he has stabbed me. As Detective Constable Fordham spoke, a man pointing a shotgun at police backed away towards the house.  Noye, was said to have told police He should not be on my property, I hope he f****** dies. While Det Murphy was watching he heard someone shout: Show us your ID or I will blow your head off. He also saw a man aim a kick at the body of his partner. After the killing, Noye is alleged to have told police: F*** off or Iaposll do you as well.Later, he was arrested inside the house and admitted arming himself with a kitchen kne. Askedhe had stabbed Fordham he is alleged to have replied: Yeah - I did him before he took the kne from me. During the questioning one officer lost his temper and flew at Noye and had to be restrained. Noye was charged with murder along with Brian Reader but acquitted in December  after an  day trial after they claimed they acted in self defence He told the jury: God bless you forever, because that is what I am, not guilty. The pair did not escape jail though as during the aftermath of the killing police recovered  gold bars worth about £,, a sackful of copper coins used in smelting, and a Guinness World Records book with the entry on the Brinks Mat robbery circled.    The following year he was jailed for handling stolen gold from the from the raid and this time did not have such kind words for the jury, shouting: “I hope you all die of cancer” as he was sent down for  years. It transpired he first melted the Brinkaposs Mat gold, then added copper to it, and re-shaped it.It was then ready to sell back through the legitimate, bullion markets... with a  per cent VAT charge. Noye was released from prison in , having served eight years but in a civil action brought by the loss adjusters of Brinkaposs-Mat insurers was forced to pay £million while he was incarcerated.Much of the money from the original raid has never been traced. Reader was jailed for nine years. Two years after being released on licence he was involved in a altercation with Stephen Cameron, , after he cut up a van driven by his girlfriend on a junction on the M. In a fight Noye stabbed and killed Cameron with a kne. This time he knew self-defence was going to be harder to convince a jury of and fled abroad by private plane. Police caught up with him in Spain and he was extradited and found guilty of murder in  but is now expected to be freed any day. His Brinks Matt co-conspirator Reader, , was released from prison last year after serving three years of a six years and three months sentence for conspiracy to commit burglary in relation to to the Hatton Garden theft.

Little Albie Steele somehow left the shunt with just cuts and bruises on Monday.    A pickup truck smashed into the back of Cara Steeleaposs Vauxhall Astra Estate, Manchester Evening News says. But a paramedic and a traffic officer told Cara, , thatAlbie had been front facing, it would have been a very dferent scenario - severe spinal injury or even internal decapitation where the spinal cord is severed from the force of the impact. Cara has shared haunting photos of the aftermath of the crash to warn other parents. If this makes one person consider extended rear facing, or turning their child back to rear facing then my story has helped somebody.    Albie is only  months old but he will rear face until he’s kg. There’s so much information out there about the benefits of rear facing, I only ask that people educate themselves with it, the teacher, from Chapel en le Frith, Derbyshire, said. Authorities stress little ones must sit in rear-facing car seats until they reach the recommended kg, or lb - up to around six years old. Two men helped get Albie out, while Cara got out through the passenger door. Cara, a mum-of-one, needed an X-ray on her spine and shoulder but it thankfully showed no fractures. She added: Albie had a couple of bruises on his leg, a small cut on his eye and on one of his legs, which we think came from the glass, but very superficial.  He’s only  months so it’s hard to say fully how he is as he can’t communicate with us. We can assume he has been aching as he will have had some force from the impact. We’ve had a couple of wake ups in the night which isn’t usual for him, but have been doing paracetamol and ibruprofen and that seems to be fine. He was asleep when the truck hit, which means he would have been as relaxed as possible, which will have helped with whiplash too.

She went on: I think adrenalin just takes over and all I cared about was him. It was only when I sat down in someone’s house that took us in that I realised I was so sore and bruised and then when I walked outside a couple of hours later and saw the car I think it really hit me.

The song was backed up by a rap about parents who never saw their children because they had to work so many jobs.Under pressure from a church primary school in one of the country’s most deprived areas, City Airport, currently in the middle of a £million ­expansion plan, decided topay up.Introducing the independently calculated London Living Wage of £. an hour from July means a £,-a-year pay rise for contractors, including cleaners and security staff.  With over % of the staff living within five miles of the runway, the children are in no doubt who will benefit. “Our parents will be less stressed than before,” head girl Zeruiah Adomake, , tells me. “We can go on school trips, our lunch meals will be better. We’ll get more time with our families because our parents won’t always be working.” Adam Hakkowski, , nods. “Parents can get presents for their children on their birthdays,” he says. Other children talk about having a hot meal or being able to go to the cinema or even save for a holiday when their parents are paid properly. This week the school found out they have been shortlisted for a Living Wage Champion Award with Newham Citizens. “This fight was David and Goliath,” deputy head Yvonne Wade tells me. “It was a small school in a deprived area of East London and the bosses of London City Airport. “But they were ­determined, even in the face of power, sat in big leather chairs, speaking to smart-looking men in suits. Do not be fooled by these kids’ smiles. These are tough cookies.” Supported by TELCO, the East London Citizens ­Organisation, St Antony’s Living Wage campaign began with a survey done by Year  pupils of the local church and school population. “Our survey found that almost half of parents earned less than the Living Wage,” Ms Wade says. “No wonder families couldn’t get a proper meal on the table, or spend enough time together.  “There was a need for change. We told City Airport: ‘No is not an option, we can’t wait’. And we won.” Alistair Rooms at TELCO said the speed with which the airport has responded is impressive. And the airport’s corporate director, Liam McKay, who visited the school, said: “London City Airport will be proud to be the first UK airport to pay the London Living Wage this summer.“That decision was undoubtedly influenced by the powerful ­advocacy from thebrilliant pupils of St Antony’s in our home borough of Newham.”Angela Moore, the head teacher, tells the school assembly: “Education is not just about teaching maths and English, science and RE. It’s about what we do with what we learn. “We don’t want our pupils to feel ashamed. We want our pupils to feel ­empowered. “You have made your presence felt in one of the poorest wards in London. “Your parents benefit directly from what you have achieved. You’ve made your futures brighter and more secure.”The children performed their song at the Barbican Centre in front of the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan , who backed their campaign all the way.They were mentored by Alistair from TELCO, Olawale Ajibola, , a cleaner who helped win the London Living Wage at the London Stadium – formerly the Olympic stadium and now home to West Ham – and Sister Una McCreesh, , from the Ursuline Convent at Forest Gate. At , Sister Una is one of the veterans of the Living Wage campaign, and was moved to start campaigning for decent wages when she was a head teacher in Newham.  One day a child had written in his book that his mother was dead. It turned out he meant that she was working three jobs and he never saw her. “We wanted to persuade HSBC to pay the living wage as it was a very big local employer,” Sister Una says. “They wouldn’t give us a meeting, so we took in the collection plate money into their busiest branch in Holborn. “We have about , ­parishioners so that collection plate money was taking a long time to put through. That tied up one teller, and the other teller had a queue of people saying they would like to open a bank account. “So, there were ­enormous queues and eventually the police were called, but we weren’t breaking any laws, of course,” she smiles politely. “We got a meeting eventually, and after that the banks started to move on wages.” Next week, Sister Una will win a Letime Achievement Award at the Living Wage Champions Awards. Meanwhile, she is proudly nurturing a new generation of campaigners. “This campaign has helped people make ends meet,” says -year-old Michael Muthiora. “But the other thing it means to me is that we get to create justice when there is a lot of injustice in the world.” "},{"url":null,"title":"pizza hut waiter tried hide","story":"NewsPizza Hut waiter tried to hide blunder after boy with allergy served cheeseZayaan Hussain, three, went into anaphylactic shock and struggled to breathe after the incident in a Blackpool branchShareCommentsByDavid GrahamDanya BazaraaNews Reporter:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video boy-dairy-allergy-gasped-air-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A waiter tried to change an incorrect order he had processed after a young boy with a dairy allergy was given cheese at a Pizza Hut , a court heard.Zayaan Hussain, three, went into anaphylactic shock and struggled to breathe after being served the wrong pizza on a family trip to a branch in Blackpool. He has a dairy intolerance and his parents asked for a vegan pizza. But because of a mistake by a waiter he was served a vegetarian pizza with cheese on it and swtly became seriously ill, a court was told. The waiter involved then tried to change the incorrect order he had put through on the computer. He has since been sacked for gross misconduct.    Lynda Bennett, prosecuting for Blackpool Borough Council, said that The Hussain family from Shipley, West Yorkshire were on a mini break in Blackpool when they went in a Pizza Hut. She said: They were with their two children, one of them three-year old Zayaan has an dairy allergy and carries around an antidote pen at all times. The parents stressed they required a totally vegan pizza with no dairy cheese for their son. They stressed it again later and James Butterworth confirmed they had vegan cheese to serve, the prosecutor said. She said when the Little Heroes meal was served the restaurant was asked again whether the pizza was vegan and were told it was. The little boy had only taken a few bites of his meal when he started to become ill and drowsy.    An ambulance was called and he was placed on oxygen. When admitted, two hospital consultants decided to give him an antidote pen and steroids and keep him on oxygen all night. He had suffered an anaphylactic shock which had narrowed his airways. Gerry Coyle, defending, said:My client wishes to apologise wholeheartedly to this family for putting them through this ordeal with its disastrous incident with its catastrophic consequences. He accepts full responsibility and this matter has haunted him ever since. He suffers from panic attacks which has been confirmed by his GP. He has since been sacked for gross misconduct. He should have realised his mistake and gone back to the table and acted.    Sentencing Butterworth of Blackpool, who admitted selling food not of the substance demanded, District Judge Jane Goodwin told him: This was a sorry and sad incident which cost this family vastly. Like many you ed to work when not fully fit and you were asked to leave back room duties to serve. You made an error and put vegetarian pizza on the order and not vegan. We can all be thankful that it was not a worse ending. Butterworth was fined £ and must pay the child £ compensation and £ court costs. The childaposs father, businessman Sajid Hussain said afterwards: It was very traumatic and we never want to go through this again. No one  should go through it either. A Pizza Hut spokeswoman said: It was an unacceptable situation back in April  and, following an immediate internal investigation, we terminated employment of the inidual involved. We took action at this restaurant to make sure it doesn’t happen again.” After the incident last year, a Pizza Hut spokesman said: “We are in contact with the family involved and are very sorry for what happened. “We realise it was an unacceptable situation and have already completed an internal investigation with the Hut, which found that the wrong pizza was given to the family as a result of human error. “We will share the full investigation findings with the Hussain family and are taking appropriate action at this restaurant to make sure it doesn’t happen again.” "},{"url":null,"title":"princess charlotte prince georges private","story":"NewsPrincess Charlotte and Prince Georges private second visit to Kates show gardenThe siblings enjoyed their first visit to mum Kates Cha Flower Show garden so much that they asked herthey could go back again, according to reportsShareCommentsByMatthew Dresch:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video kate-bringing-children-cha-see-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrincess Charlotte and Prince George had so much fun during their first visit to Kateaposs Cha Flower Show garden that they went back for a second private visit.

The prince and princess roamed around for about half an hour and also visited other gardens at the show, before the public were let in at am. Kate, who has reportedly been to the site at least eight times in the last week, said her creation was intended to boost awareness about the physical and mental benefits of being among nature.  Members of the public have been queuing for hours to see the garden since the Cha Flower Show opened on Tuesday. Charlotte and George first visited the garden with their parents and younger brother Louis on Sunday, with Kensington Palace releasing heartwarming pictures of the trip. In one of the snaps Charlotte, four, and Prince George, five, are both sitting on a bridge, dipping their bare feet into a stream.  In another shot, the princess, dressed in a floral frock, is holding onto a rope swing and looking back at the cameraman with an angelic smile on her face. Prince Louis, one, also got to try the rope swing in the show garden, with dad William, , balancing him on top of the ball. Another image shows the Duchess of Cambridge, who took a hands-on approach to designing the garden, with her left arm around a standing Louis - wearing shorts and a cardigan.    He looks fascinated as he holds a stone with Kate kneeling at his side as they explore the RHS Back to Nature Garden at the Cha Flower Show on Sunday afternoon ahead of its public unveiling. William and his two oldest children climbed into the tree house, while the duke also enjoyed a go on the swing. The photos, taken by Matt Porteous, were released by Kensington Palace as the Duchess promotes her garden which was inspired by her childhood and is aimed at encouraging children to play outdoors to benefit their mental health and development.

Ivan Mishukov, now , was rescued at the age of five after two years in which the animals were his “only family”. Each morning the feral tot went with the dogs to beg for food from a local bakery in Reutov near Moscow. His story became known around the world when he was found. Now Ivan - also called Vanya - has spoken of the debt he owed the strays. While usually trying to avoid talking about that grim period of his le, and now earning his own living with a factory job, he admitted: “I understand thatit wasnapost for those dogs I wouldnapost have survived in the street.    “But I am also grateful to policemen who took me from the pack, and of course to my foster mum who raised me.” Ivan was living with an alcoholic grandfather who abandoned him for days on end and he turned to the strays for solace - and food. It took police three attempts to prise the boy away from the dogs because the strays refused to let humans come close to their child. I loved the dogs and they loved me, he told social workers after he was rescued. The dogs were named Jesse, Goga, Masha and Seva - and when the animals scavenged food they shared it with him, and vice versa.    They “kept me warm” on icy nights when he cuddled up to them, he revealed.

A journey from here to Stonehaven before the bypass took  minutes, today it takes  minutes.“That helps to improve the quality of le for people who have to make that commute regularly by reducing congestion and reducing journey times. It helps to lower emissions as well and brings big economic advantages.“The site we’re on just now, Aker – they made the decision to centralise operations largely because of the AWPR.”Initial monitoring by Transport Scotland found key journey times have been reduced by half, even during rush hour, through the -mile AWPR route between Stonehaven and south of Ellon.The £ million project finally opened to drivers in February after being dogged by a series of delays and contractual problems.Transport Scotland missed its “late autumn” target date and a later aspiration of January due to work repairing defects on the new River Don bridge after cracks were discovered.When askedany lessons could be learned from the handling of the project, Ms Sturgeon said: “While not underplaying these issues, they are not unheard of in big, complicated infrastructure projects. vw, px\"  “The AWPR, when it was under construction, was one of the biggest projects of its kind anywhere in Europe.“These things are not unusual – there are issues that will need to be worked through – but in five, ,  years time, I don’t think these will be the things people are talking about but the massive benefits.”Transport Secretary Michael Matheson, who also attended yesterday’s event, said feedback on the route has been “overwhelmingly positive”.He said: “We can now see from the studies we’ve undertaken in recent months since the road was opened that traffic in Aberdeen city centre has reduced by %.“We’ve already had feedback from some in industry who have said, for example, they can see house prices shting in areas that are much more accessible as a result of the road.”Mr Matheson said the cost of the project remained the “exact same” as it had at the outset.He added: “With any additional costs associated with the road, the responsibility lies with the contractors to demonstrate that there’s a process in place to facilitate that and, to date, they’ve not been able to substantiate their claim.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

It is obvious to everyone that the pier not being open is a resource wasted.#Inveraray Pier has been in existence since . Comprising an older stone-built section and later timber structure, it was once a thriving hub for Inveraray#s herring fleet and a popular destination for passenger steamers. It was used by everything from pleasure craft to puffers, with the military also making good use of it over the years.In more recent times it has fallen into disrepair and was closed off to public access in the last decade.#When we heard it was for sale we decided to make a bid,# continued Mr Byrne.#It would have been a shame to see it fall into the hands of someone who would want to use it just as a private pier. It#s about securing its future.#The Byrne family intends to re-open the pier for public use # but Mr Byrne is keen to dampen speculation about the potential future uses for the structure.Before anything  happens, the condition of the stone and wooden sections must be assessed, and reports have been commissioned from engineers and conservation architects.#I don#t want to raise expectation unnecessarily, but the most likely scenario is that we look to re-open the stone pier first of all,# explained Mr Byrne.Repairs would be needed to the stone structure and ironwork. New handrails and safety equipment would be needed along with lighting and basic security measures such as CCTV.Beyond that, the future of the wooden pier looks less certain.refurbishment is not an option, alternatives might include floating pontoons, while the potential for dredging around the pier and harbour might be considered.Through an agent, The Argyll Partnership, the Byrne family has contacted the Clyde Marine Planning Partnership with a view to having Inveraray included in the fledgling Clyde Regional Marine Plan, stressing that the pier #represents a great opportunity to contribute to the economic, social and environmental needs of the Clyde Marine Region#.And the new owners have said that the community council, Inspire Inveraray and others from the area will be fully involved as the redevelopment takes shape. The plans are also said to have the backing of the Duke of Argyll.Mr Byrne concluded: #Hopefully local people will want to help and come forward with ideas.#I don#t want to raise hopes at this early stage, but I hope that buying the pier is a good thing to do.#"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 24 5 19","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe numbers drawn for the Kilmory Camanachd Club lottery draw on Monday May  were ,  and .

When she contacted the council to press for vegan meals they claimed it was not possible to provide vegan meals that complied with the nutritional guidelines for school meals.ldquoThat is quite clearly incorrect. The British Dietetic Association has long recognised that we can get all the nutrients we need on a fully plant-based diet, at every stage of le.ldquoIf Glasgow and East Renfrewshire councils can produce vegan menus that comply with guidelines, so too can Scottish Borders Council.ldquoAs a result of the councilrsquos refusal, the eldest child of the vegan parent had already missed out on free school meals in P-.ldquoI wrote to Scottish Borders Council challenging their refusal to provide vegan meals, pointing out their legal obligations under human rights and equality law. That letter was sent by email on May .ldquoOn May  the vegan parent had a call from the council advising that they would be providing vegan meals for her child from the following Monday.ldquoThat just goes to show how quickly these situations can be resolved and vegan meals put in place when the rights of vegans are brought to the attention of government body.The mother of the two children, Laura, who wishes to remain anonymous, believes the intervention of Go Vegan World was vital.She said: ldquoAlthough the response of the Scottish Borders Council was disappointing three years ago, we are extremely pleased with how things are now developing.ldquoThey are trying hard to meet our daughterrsquos needs and are offering to have a meeting with us to discuss things further.ldquoScottish Borders Council have been great and very quickly we have a vegan option for our child at her school.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos schools are now able to offer meals such as vegetable pizza, with no cheese, and vegan sausages with baked beans and potato smiles.However, Ms Bolton continued: ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be having to make these challenges for inidual vegan families across Scotland vegan options should be available on the standard menu every day for any child to choose, in the same way that vegan options are available in most restaurants and cafes.ldquoThe public sector is lagging far behind the private sphere in providing for vegans, and in making good plant-based options available to everyone.ldquoIt is essential that vegan children are able to live according to their conviction that itrsquos wrong to use and kill animals, including when theyrsquore in school.ldquoThat means food suitable for vegans must be provided. It is not acceptable that vegan children are missing out on free school meals, or that they are excluded from eating in the school canteen with their friends.ldquoWe should be supporting children who have made a moral decision to avoid animal use and killing, recognising the impact their behaviour has on others. A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoOur schools are in a much better position to provide nutritionally balanced vegan meals than they were previously.ldquoFor example, we can now buy things like soya milk, hummus and vegan sausages, which werenrsquot available on our order list even a couple of years ago.ldquoAt no point did Scottish Borders Council say a vegan menu canrsquot offer vital nutrients.ldquoHowever, as we did not offer a specic vegan option, offering the child part of a mealwould not have been nutritionally balanced and would not meet her energy requirements."},{"url":null,"title":"jenna-named-beltane-queen-for-2019","story":"YOU donrsquot have to be born into Royalty to be a Queen, not in the Royal Burgh of Peebles anyway.For this town celebrates its own monarch family each year.And on Wednesday afternoon schoolgirl Jenna Jones was proclaimed  Queen of the Beltane Festival.The sun shone in a cloudless sky and townsfolk gathered outside Peebles Community Centre waiting to greet the new Queen and her Court.Cheering schoolchildren applauded as the names of the delighted pupils were announced within the hall, and when it came to the announcement of this yearrsquos Queen, a clearly shocked Jenna threw her hands to her mouth gasping in sheer surprise.The -year-old from Priorsford Primary School told the Peeblesshire News that she feels very grateful and lucky to be chosen.She added: ldquoIrsquom so excited to begin the role of Beltane Queen and all thatrsquos involved.Jennarsquos parents, Lisa and Mike were standing outside waiting to catch a glimpse of their daughter when she exited the community hall.

revealed that the council paid the sum over the last six weeks, in order to get a former employee to sign a non-disclosure agreement.The request has also revealed that Scottish Borders Council has spent pound, of taxpayersrsquo money on so-called lsquogagging ordersrsquo since April .Non-disclosure agreements are contracts which are signed by both employee and employer, and which typically prevent staff or ex-staff from publicising certain information.That information can range from commercially sensitive details, such as innovations or company finances, to anything likely to damage an organisationrsquos reputation.Non-disclosure agreements have also infamously been used to prevent employees discussing allegations of misbehaviour, with a number of high profile cases in the UK making national headlines.A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: ldquoNon-disclosure agreementsare included in ious types of agreement entered into by the council to resolve a situation.ldquoNDAs are included for the benefit of both the council and the other party parties.ldquoIt is important to note that an NDA is one part of an overall agreement to settle a dispute, and the majority of any costs will be met from within the relevant servicersquos budget.The contracts are sometimes used when employees and their organisations have reached a settlement to a dispute, such as a claim of wrongful dismissal, without going through a full employment tribunal hearing.Reacting to the payouts, Hawick and Hermitage councillor Davie Paterson said: ldquoI am a bit concerned at the use of no disclosure

even-handed approach to non disclosure agreements.He said: ldquoSecrecy by a public authority is sometimes necessary, but any overuse does not reflect well on a public authority which should be committed to openness and transparency. ldquoI read of growing concern about the use of non disclosure agreements across a range of public bodies with Westminster MPrsquos, for example, calling for these to be made lsquoa thing of the pastrsquo.ldquoThat said I donrsquot currently think that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos use of these agreements is particularly out of line with their use by

Scottish Borders Council over the last five years.ldquoI am minded, as chair of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee, to discuss with colleagues on this committee whether to suggest we

But hes still a bit bewildered by it all.\"Im completely surprised about it,\" he declares.\"For lack of any better phrase, I dont have a f***ing clue whats going on!\"There is much to talk to him about, from his rise to fame and his accolades, which include a Brit Critics Choice Award nomination, a place on BBC Musics Sound of  list and his seven weeks at number one for his single Someone You Loved.There is also his penchant for discussing his toilet habits and mocking himself on Instagram.Capaldi is almost as famous for his social media shenanigans as he is for his heavenly voice and charismatic, emotional ballads, but he says the two seemingly at-odds facets of his persona were not planned to be that way.\"I dont really pay much mind to what I put on social media, as you can probably f***ing tell,\" he jokes.\"I just act like a tit and film it for a laugh, but the music side of things I put thought into.\"Maybe people like me because of a combination of the two, but I never set out to be anything in particular.

I dont understand how this is a thing!\"Capaldi has . million Instagram followers and , on Twitter, and they have become accustomed to his hilarious self-filmed videos in which he mocks himself, often in a pair of bizarre sunglasses or a not-so-fetching shell suit.Having been named \"the funniest musician on social media\" by a number of outlets, one of his most popular moments saw him complaining about blocking his toilet in a fancy American hotel, but discovering the absence of a plunger or toilet brush.The sunglasses in particular are a common trope of Capaldis. So much so, his fans are now gting him with more shades than he can deal with.\"Whenever we go on tour Ive got a suitcase full of ridiculous sunglasses,\" he says.\"But Im getting into it.

It was reported to be the first time anybody has planned a tour in such large venues before their debut album had even been released.\"I mean, I was quite content when we were doing our tour at the end of last year,\" Capaldi says.\"We were doing gigs in , capacity rooms and I was like, This is incredible, this is as big as Im ever going to get and thats absolutely fine.\"Ive always been quite laid-back. When I first got my manager, I said all I want to do is play King Tuts, which is a place in Glasgow for  people - thats a goal.\"And then I did it, and now its gone beyond anything that I could have ever hoped for.\"He laughs: \"So all of this is a complete f***ing surprise.\"He says he was \"shitting it\" when he announced the arena tour weeks before his debut album, Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent, was scheduled to drop.\"Ive got a lot of faith in all the people around me that are actual professionals, as opposed to me whos a bit of an impostor, but the people around me were saying, Look, this is the right move.\"And I was like, OK cool, Ill give it a go. So we did it, and now its sold out.\"Even now Im still nervous. It already went from small pubs to a few thousand capacity rooms, very quickly, and now its going from that to , people.\"Its a long way from half a letime ago for Capaldi who, at the age of , started performing in pubs.\"I started playing the guitar when I was nine, because my older brother, who is six years older than me, he was doing it,\" he explains.\"I started writing songs from that age too, and when I turned  I wanted to play gigs. My older brother, he was in a band, and he got me into pubs. Obviously I was  so I wasnt allowed to be in a pub, so Id have to go and hide in the bathroom before I played, and Id always leave immediately after.\"I did that, kicking around throughout Scotland from then until the age of  or .\"Capaldi was in and out of bands throughout that time, but was better off as a solo artist, recording songs on his phone and uploading them to his SoundCloud account.\"My manager now, he found me online through that. He was just scouring SoundCloud and just happened to find one of my scratchy f***ing demos and emailed me out of the blue... and here we are!\" he adds, still stupefied.With the album on the cusp of release, and the arena tour ready to go throughout this year and into , talk turns to the future, which Capaldi admittedly hasnt thought much about.Hes still keen to just have a night out drinking Buckfast Tonic Wine and lager with his friends in his native Scotland when he can, \"like any normal -year-old\", he says, and hes banked a \"four-day bender\" to celebrate the success of his number one single Someone You Loved later this year.But when asked about his big goals, he ponders for a moment.\"Id maybe like to have a top five album, thatd be nice,\" he says.\"And get to that level in dferent territories too. The UK is leading the pack at the moment, which is great, but Id love to, way down the line, have that somewhere outside of the UK.\"Id like to see what we can do in America, andI could do a collaboration with someone at some point, maybe after the albums out.\"He adds, with a laugh: \"Its good to have goals, but I dunno, f***ing hell!

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Is Creative Scotland more dictator than facilitator ","story":"As a director of the Scottish Review of Booksndash and married to its editor Alan Taylor ndash I, and the rest of the SRB board, know these feelings all too well. When our recent application for pound, was turned down, shortly before a new issue was due to be published, the future of the SRB began to look shaky. Currently, while the website will continue, there is no immediate prospect of another print edition.This is not the time to revisit the decision taken over the SRB. It is, however, justiable to question the wider role Creative Scotland is playing in our national culture. When the SRBrsquos bid was rejected, advice was offered on how to strengthen a future approach. This entailed considerably enlarging ourcottage industry into a much bigger concern, costing four times the amount we had asked for. Among the conditions imposed was a higher degree of editorial and board member ersity, thereby meeting Creative Scotland policy.Regardless of CS injunctions, the quest for ersity is always a consideration when shaping the content of a journal, let alone selecting members of an orchestra, theatre production, or any other artistic venture. Yet, while as wide as possible a range of talents, voices, background and experience is important, the pre-eminent consideration for anyone pulling the strings, be they film director, editor, choreographer or artist, is quality and originality. These are the foremost consideration, after which all other matters must join the queue.Read more: Scottish Review of Books ceases magazine publication after funding lossCreative Scotland sits in judgment on others, imposing a benchmark which its own performance does not reach. Perhaps, then, now is a good time for this perpetually-troubled outfit to pause, and consider exactly what it is hoping to achieve. The CS mantra has always been that it operates at ldquoarmrsquos . Yet, as the SRB has discovered to its cost, this is not true. Rather, it pokes its finger into peoplersquos eyes. In our case you could call it positively meddlesome, telling us what kind of journal they would like us to be, what ourshould be, and how we ought to operate.Unlike the majority of arts bodies requesting government subsidy, the SRB can express its dismay and dissatisfaction. Most organisations and iniduals are not in that position. To publicly criticise CS is to make themselves pariahs. Disgruntled musicians, artists or writers might throw caution to the winds, risking only their own careers, but for the heads of theatres, orchestras, book festivals and the like, employeesrsquo jobs are on the line. To challenge the process, or to refuse to agree to CSrsquos demands, is to find themselves precariously exposed. And, since decisions about what and who get funded are taken in secret, it is not possible to be confident there is no hidden score settling or prejudice behind the funding outcome. I am not saying there are grudges or grievances behind any decision CS makes ndash hopefully not. But with the names of the decision-makers redacted, how could we ever know This is an issue far bigger and more important than the fortunes of the SRB. If Creative Scotland now perceives its role as actively shaping the remit and expression of the arts and those who produce them, it is in danger of losing its raison drsquoetre as a supportive, informed and impartial source of finance. Instead, it is metamorphosing into a manesto-waving, policy-driven arm of an increasingly authoritarian state. As such, it could fairly be accused of politicising and manipulating our culture from the top down, rather than giving those who produce music, art, poetry or drama freedom to roam and set their own agenda.Imposing BAME ersity targets, for instance, in a country whose ethnic profile is at best patchy and in some cases negligible, is to put the implementation of an inarguably important principle higher than any other consideration. When that principle becomes inflexible or unrealistic, it ceases to be far-sighted and inclusive, and instead becomes a diktat that builds rather than demolishes walls. Implementing rules on quotas, subject matter, personnel or outlook is in effect imposing editorial control from on high. Far better would be to trust the arts to evolve, expand, advance or change as best befits their nature. To do otherwise is to turn the state into a nanny or teacher ndash less Mary Poppins, you might say, and more like cane-crazy Wackford Squeers."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9892229.jpg?type=article-full","title":"how-to-plan-your-perfect-tailor-made-holiday","story":"Bespoke luxury holidays are a dominant force within the current climate, with more and more travellers setting their sights on worldwide locations and unique pursuits.

In digital form, at least.Experts from the University of St Andrews have virtually reconstructed the lost home of the Donald clan, whose scions the MacDonald family ruled over a kingdom stretching from the Hebrides the Kintyre peninsula on mainland Scotland. Major archaeological work by the National Museum of Scotland enabled the Universitys Open Virtual Worlds Team, and spin-out company Smart History, to recreate Finlaggan as it would have looked like in the th century when the Lordship was at the height of its power.Built on an island on Loch Finlaggan, the castle was made up of a compound comprising several buildings, and was joined to the land through a causeway.Finlaggan Castle today Pic:By Heikki Immonen WikipediaAt that time, Islay was the administrative and ceremonial centre of the realm, which maintained its independence from the Scottish throne, and served both as a base and the site of the Council of the isles, where the Lord would gather the leaders of the most powerful factions of the clan to hear disputes and thrash out policy.The computer simulation depicts the twin islands of Eilean Morand Eilean na Comhairle , and their surrounding environment on Loch Finlaggan.By the late Middle Ages, the Lords of the Islesrsquo residence had little in the way of defensive structures ndash possibly indicating how secure the MacDonalds felt in the heart of their powerbase on Islay.:Island le could be transformed with first of its kind plans to boost economyFinlaggan was also the place where new Lords would be crowned - Islay is often called the Cradle of Clan Donald - in a ceremony which saw the Bishop of Argyle, the Bishop of the Isles, and as many as seven priests priests in attendance, along with the heads of all major clans.A possibly apocryphal take has it that the new ruler would place his foot in a footprint carved into a rock, symbolising his links to the ancestors whose path he was bound to follow.In collaboration with the Finlaggan Trust, the reconstruction is based on discoveries made by the Finlaggan Archaeological Project, led by archaeologist Dr David Caldwell, who provided advice to the St Andrews team.The Great HallDocumentary research and comparison with other late medieval sites has been used to ensure the reconstruction is as accurate as possible.It shows how the main hall of Finlaggan would have looked like from the outside, sitting among its cluster of out buildings.The computer simulation also illustrate how the medieval Great hall would have looked like when the Lord was in attendance, complete with plaid tapestries, long tables and chairs.:North and South Uist try to cash in on tourist boom#The digital research in St Andrews was led by Dr Alan Miller of the School of Computer Science, while digital modelling was undertaken by Sarah Kennedy of the School of Computer Science, with additional historical research by Dr Bess Rhodes of the School of History and the School of Computer Science.The reconstruction will be available as an interactive virtual reality experience at the Finlaggan Trustrsquos visitor centre on Islay. There is also an app and an online video.Dr Bess Rhodes, of the University, said: ldquoFinlaggan was an amazing place to recreate digitally. Even today the islands of Eilean Mor and Eilean na Comhairle are beautul places, and in the Middle Ages they were the site of a remarkable complex of buildings which blended local traditions with wider European trends.The CausewayldquoThe work by Dr David Caldwell and the Finlaggan Archaeological Project has transformed our understanding of this site ndash giving us a glimpse of the relative comfort in which the Lords of the Isles and their followers lived, pampering their dogs with decorative collars, and enjoying music, imported wine and board games.:Work underway on poundm Lews Castle upgrade#The Lordship of the Isles persisted for around  years, until holder John of Islay made the fatal mistake of allying with England against the James IV in the hope of growing his power.He was stripped of part of his lands and lost much prestige, eventually being deposed by his son Angus.

The council’s Infrastructure Services Committeedecided on Thursday, May  to introduce alternative arrangements to push up recycling rates and reduce materials sent to landfill. They approved an option to use households’ existing bins in a three-weekly collection cycle while officers continue to work to explore funding opportunities for further changes. One bin and a food waste caddy will continue to be collected every week meaning week one will start with general waste binsand food waste collected, week two will see Recycling binand food waste collected, and week three will also be a recycling bin and food waste collection.The materials that can be recycled on the kerbside remain the same - the only dference is that the blue-lidded recycling bin is emptied more often.The new service will be piloted in some areas in  and rolled out to the rest of Aberdeenshire in .Households will be contacted in advance by post.As over % of the waste produced in Aberdeenshire is recyclable using the existing recycling services, this change should allow an increased recycling rate, while work continues to seek other ways to push that up even further using kerbside services. ISC chair Peter Argyle said: “Clearly the decision by Zero Waste Scotland not to consider our funding bid has had a negative effect on our well-developed plans to push up Aberdeenshire’s recycling rate and send less recyclable materials to landfill.“This was not our first choice as a solution, but this is the position we find ourselves in and we feel that this option makes the most of a dficult situation and will help push up recycling rates. “At present, we see this as an interim measure, while we work to deliver a permanent scheme which provides a service for our residents which enables them to recycle as many materials as possible.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Meldrum Library is located at the Academy campus\"  Help Doctor Who by visiting library viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"“One of the key things we continue to try to impress is that we want residents to simply think for a second about how they dispose of the waste they generate, then use the services we provide as best they can.” Vice chair John Cox said: “It can come as no surprise to anyone that councils are trying their hardest to offer services which push up recycling rates and make the most of recyclable materials. “I’m pleased officers have been able to come up with an interim alternative which keeps us moving in the right direction. “Although landfill capacity is essentially reduced,recycling services are used to their full capacity most households should be able to cope and the use of the food waste bin means there should be no additional hygiene issues either.”Other changes to be introduced under the new Waste Strategy are still going ahead – including improvements to Household Waste Recycling Centres from this month and an increased number of garden waste collection points across the area this summer.Over half the materials in local non-recyclable waste bins are recyclable through existing services – equating to around , tonnes of recyclable materials being landfilled at a cost of £.million a year.Not only does maximising the value of a material benefit the environment, it also frees up money for other essential council services."},{"url":null,"title":"changes to come at aberdeenshire hwrcs","story":"As part of Aberdeenshire#s sht towards greater recycling rates and sending less materials to landfill, tyres and asbestos will no longer be accepted at any of the area#s Household Waste Recycling Centresfrom Monday, June .The change, which also applies to four of the council’s waste transfer stations, is expected to save around £, a year and have minimal impact on householders. The money saved will be used to employ extra staff at recycling centres, who will advise customers how best to dispose of materials, helping to increase recycling rates and reduce disposal costs. Tyres are not classed as household waste and the council has no legal responsibility to deal with them – anyone buying new tyres can pay for disposal of the old ones at the same time. Although one of the lowest tonnages of any materials handled at HWRCs, tyres are one of the most expensive to dispose of. With very limited options to recycle or reuse them, they are currently sent to a cement kiln for use as fuel, at a cost to the council. Asbestos, only currently accepted by the council at four sites under limited circumstances, is currently sent to a specialist landfill site for disposal at signicant cost. Although tyres and asbestos together only account for less than .% of the waste handled by the council each year, neither method of dealing with these materials is classed as recycling. Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: “We know a very small number of Aberdeenshire residents bring tyres or asbestos to the council for disposal. This service is an expensive one to provide and only benefits a few residents. “Neither of these materials contribute to the council’s recycling rate, but they do cost signicant amounts of money to deal with and take up space at the facilities where they are collected. “Requiring the person or company which generates this type of waste to ensure it is disposed of correctly at their expense not only saves the council money which is being reinvested in better services, it also frees up space for the recycling of other materials in future.“Many tyre retailers offer a disposal service for old tyres for a small fee and vehicle users should make use of this service where possible, as most people do.“There are commercial companies who will accept asbestos waste for disposal at two licensed landfill sites for a fee and anyone disposing of this material is advised to contact them.” Signs will be in place at facilities which have accepted the materials in the past advising of the change. Information on alternative disposal will also be available at HWRCs, service points and libraries. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

To enter the competition, members of the public should post a portrait photo celebrating walking in some way, on Twitter or Instagram, using the hashtag #HumansOfTheWalk. Multiple entries are allowed with the competition running until Friday, May , next week. Those who take part are in with the chance of winning a Nikon B Coolpix camera.Ian Findlay, chief officer at Paths for All, said: “Orkney has a number of great walking routes — whether it’s residential streets or local paths and green spaces — and we’re keen for the community to celebrate how they make these part of their daily routines.“We want the photos to be a true reflection of everyday walking — walking that builds friendships, gives you headspace and gets you feeling fitter and out enjoying nature.“Walking can help prevent ill health, build communities and create a happier, healthier, greener Scotland and we know that people can demonstrate just that with their Humans of the Walk photos. “We want to revolutionise the way people use their cities, and stop our spaces from being dominated by cars. Scotland’s towns and cities should be a backdrop for people walking, scooting, cycling or simply spending time enjoying cleaner, quieter, calmer streets.“Paths for All is looking forward to seeing them all and wish everyone who enters the competition the best of luck.”Paths For All#s aim is to signicantly increase the number of people who choose to walk in Scotland, whether it’s walking for leisure, to work, to school or to the shops. The charity works to create more opportunities and better environments for walking, as well as cycling and other activities to help make Scotland a more active and greener place.For more information on Humans of the Walk and the competition, visit: https:www.pathsforall.org.uk humanscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is both the highest volume of advance sales ever achieved in the voluntary-run festival’s -year tenure, as well as the greatest number of pre-festival sellouts. Stromness, the festival’s hometown in Orkney’s West Mainland, has already begun welcoming early arrivals, including some of this year’s furthest travelled visitors # Cape Breton’s globetrotting powerhouse quartet, Còig # as well as famed Irish singer Cara Dillon and Irish firebrands Four Men and a Dog, who are currently celebrating their th year on the road.Whilst early arrivals are no rarity for the festival, a far greater number than usual are already in Orkney, owing to a one-day Air Traffic Controllers’ strike across Scotland’s Highlands and Islands taking place today. As well as the closure of Kirkwall Airport, Inverness — a hub for flights from Ireland and England, before the final hop up to the islands — is also shut. With just a fortnight’s notice,  inbound arrivals originally scheduled for today, Thursday, have been rerouted, leading to early arrivals for most.Those already enjoying Orkney’s famed hospitality will soon be joined by fellow headliners including the groundbreaking Scottish three-piece, Lau a newly formed trio of celebrated Irish musicians John Doyle, Dermot Byrne and Éamonn Coyne and internationally renowned Hebridean vocalists, Julie Fowlis and Kathleen MacInnes, who visit Orkney as part ‘Between Islands’ # a collaborative project led by Stornoway’s An Lanntair, uniting musicians from Orkney, Shetland and the Outer Hebrides. Emerging artists are also prominent in this year’s festival programme, with appearances from BBC Radio Scotland’s Young Musician of the Year , Benedict Morris new Scottish six-piece Heisk and Helensburgh fiddler Ryan Young, whose accompanist, Jenn Butterworth, will work a double-sht across the next four nights, also playing with the high-spirited Glasgow group Kinnaris Quintet. In total,  acts will meet in Stromness — with the  visiting acts welcomed and outnumbered by Orkney’s thriving local folk scene, which itself features internationally renowned artists such as Saltfishforty, The Chair, The Wrigley Sisters and Gnoss, alongside local favourites including Hullion, the Kirkwall City Pipe Band # currently celebrating their centenary year # and many more. This amounts to an estimated  featured musicians # though many more will meet in Stromness, with the town’s pubs and hotels bursting with informal pub sessions from opening to closing time across the four days, alongside the ticketed programme. As well as Stromness, this year the festival reaches out to communities in Birsay, Burray, Finstown, Kirkwall, Orphir, Quoyloo, Sanday, Sandwick, St Margaret’s Hope, Stenness and Tankerness.In order to stage such a large event, the festival gratefully receives generous support from public bodies and corporate sponsors, from throughout the local and national business communities. This year’s principal supporters are Orkney Islands Council, Creative Scotland, NorthLink Ferries, Loganair — who also facilitated the rebooking of all those affected by the air traffic strike at zero cost, the Pier Arts Centre, and EIS, alongside many more inidual event sponsors and corporate patrons. The festival also benefits from many thousands of hours donated by hundreds of volunteers, who give their time freely to bring the world-renowned event together. From the twelve-strong year round management committee, to those who might work on just one event in their local community hall, each one of the festival’s community team is vital to its long standing, continued and increasing success.Festival director, Bob Gibbon said: “After many months of preparation we are delighted to be welcoming visitors and artists from far and wide, friends old and new, musicians from across the globe, to Orkney for what is set to be a memorable weekend of fun and good times. #Everyone has come together create a magnicent programme of events, and the festival just gets better and better. Orkney should rightly be very proud of what we can share, and this weekend is about sharing music, memories, time and happiness. Enjoy it everyone!”The festival’s chair, Elaine Grieve added: #I say this every year but I#m really excited about the programme for the weekend. There#s something for everyone fabulous visiting acts and a great number of local artists — and that#s something we really want to share with audiences. #It#s such a lovely time with many familiar faces ing and new joining the fold # a bit like a huge family reunion!#Alan Morrison, head of music at Creative Scotland said: “There are few places in Scotland with a more magical atmosphere than Orkney, where the stones of past civilisations sit alongside the buzz of the modern world. That’s also true of the Orkney Folk Festival, where the island’s heritage is woven into music being made by some of our best standard-bearers and rising stars. #It’s great to see so many brilliantly talented artists sharing a bill with musicians from far and near – andsome of them had to arrive a day early, well, that just means the sessions are already underway.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The final, which was held in Essex on Saturday, May , saw the finalists complete five tough physical challenges, as well as an interview with judges focusing on mental health.The competition was launched to promote mental and physical health in agriculture in a fun and engaging way.Mr Cursiter was announced as the men#s winner today, with -year-old Fiona Penfold, from the West Country, announced as the women#s winner.Asked about the importance of fitness to both mental and physical health, Sean said: #Farmers are constantly being required to produce cheap food while input costs rise. In Orkney there are a lot of farmers on their own, with  cows, living a lonely existence — they might not see another person for weeks.#He said that#s why he makes a conscious effort to socialise with others. Playing rugby for Orkney#s first team is a big part of this.#If folks close themselves in and just farm, then that#s not a good state of mind to be in. It#s hard to come away from the farm and be social, but it does have its benefits, and sometimes the lack of time is over-used as an excuse.##There are  hours in the day, so you need to give one to yourself. It#s good to have a hobby, and I don#t find that my sport has a negative effect on the farm.#For more on this story, see next week#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Instead, it’s about our ability to act as decent human beings, to use reasoned arguments against those we disagree with and,these fail, to agree to disagree in a spirit of civility,perhaps not always friendship. And it’s also about our political leaders demonstrating that they are committed to these basic standards and disapprove of those who fail to live up to them.In recent times, we have seen MPs harrassed and intimidated outside the Westminster parliament, called “traitors” and “Nazis”, while throwing milkshakes has become so common that police have asked some fast-food restaurants to stop selling them when a particular type of politician is in the area.: Kenny MacAskill: Brexit-induced contempt for politicians is risk to democracyAnd yesterday, Police Scotland’s Deputy Chief Constable Will Kerr told a meeting of the Scottish Police Authority that they had decided to deploy more than  officers to ensure public safety during today’s European Parliament elections. “We would have never normally done that in the past. We would never normally have needed that level of support, particularly for European elections.

Supporting UK membership of the EU is not “treason” no politician should claim it is time to “behead the political class”.

But the continual improvement of financial services, driven in part by Scotland’s booming fintech sector, enables us to understand our spending better now than ever before.window.twttr “Cash rules everything around me,” was the refrain of “C.R.E.A.M”, by the Wu-Tang Clan, commenting on the big-spending US rap music scene in the s. But the music stars of the future are unlikely to have the same reverence for dollar bills, pound notes, or indeed any other kind of physical currency.Thanks to the rapid development of smartphones and financial technologies, we all now have the ability to pay for pretty much anything without ever having to visit a cash machine.And fintech companies are now working closely with the established banking giants to better understand how people engage with both money and technology.Whether it’s getting an approval for a mortgage, or simply saving for a rainy day, technology is helping tailor better products to help us achieve our financial goals.Such products may not inspire any pop or rap hits of the future, but they are already an invaluable tool for many people.To develop such a consumer-led approach, the country’s fintech firms are busy trying to understand what drives our spending.Stephen Ingledew, the chief executive of FinTech Scotland, has had years of experience in the financial sector, where he has played an active and major role in implementing \u2028customer-focused and technology-enabled initiatives.As a former senior executive for large companies, such as Standard Le and Barclays, as well as smaller financial enterprises, he is ideally placed to help both with mutually beneficial enterprises.“Organisations are not just focusing on the emotional side,” he says. “What we’re involved in is how fintech people engage with money and technology.“The interesting thing about fintech is it does not start with finance or technology – it starts with the human need. Then companies work back to find out how they can better serve that need. It could be spending, it could be saving, it could be anything to do with money.”Ingledew admits that in the past, the big banks often adopted a one-size-fits-all approach to products. However, he is confident that fintechs can help change that.“Because you start with a human point of view, you are more likely to actually meet people’s real needs,” he adds. “That’s something financial services has not always done very well in the past. It has tended to rather push products on people rather than start with the need. Fintech is turning that upside down.“Fintech is helping banks take a much more consumer-led approach, rather than simply trying to sell a product.”Role of moneyThe FinTech Scotland boss is understandably keen to promote the innovative work already being done north of the Border. He cites MoneyMatiX as one example of a fintech company which helps customers better understand where their cash comes from and where it goes each month.He says: “MoneyMatiX is all about helping people understand the role of money – they call it financial literacy. If you’ve got a better understanding, you can make better decisions – whether to spend, whether to save, how best to pay.Castlight Financial, which offers real-time affordability and financial capability analysis, is another.Ingledew says: “Castlight Financial, based in Glasgow, helps customers really understand their ability to borrow money. “Rather than taking a credit score, they are understanding someone’s behaviour. How money is going in and out, how they are spending. How that could be improved so they can get a low rate of interest when they borrow.“They are focused on behaviour. One of those aspects is people’s emotional responses to what we buy and how we spend it. “The key thing about data is that it’s not just about financial data, or looking at someone’s financial record in a very narrow way. “What affordability assessment does is look at people’s data. Two people may get the same salary but their behaviour may be very dferent. One may be very frugal, one may be very spendthrt. That’s where behaviour becomes very important – instead of just looking at where the money comes from and where it goes out.”While the average bank customer may not be intimately familiar with fintechs, that does not mean that they have not already benefitted from their work.“None of these fintechs are going to become household names in the near future, like HSBC or RBS. What they are doing is helping the big institutions to reinvent themselves,” Ingledew observes. “They are behind the scenes.”“The strength of Scotland is we have these big companies here. Scotland is a small market, but there is the ability to experiment by fintechs working alongside international companies based here.”Ingledew believes that products developed by the sector in Scotland could have a world-wide impact, saying: “The big opportunity is being able to reinvent banks around people and communities.“It’s not a given, but technology is the enabler that could allow that.\u2028If you apply the right kind of thinking – by starting with the human need – that provides the right kind of opportunity to bring in these new technologies to better understand their money than before.“To some degree that has already happened – we all have smartphones – but that doesn’t mean we’ve become much better educated on finance. So you have to ask what  can be done to make them feel more empowered with their money.”But what do the fintechs themselves have to say about emotion and how it drives our spending  Tynah Matembe and Helene Rodger, co-founders of MoneyMatiX, say theyfirst encountered financial illiteracy while working with young people who had no financial guidance because the adults and carers in their lives were financially illiterate themselves.The duo point to research which suggest parents in the UK pay out £. billion per annum in pocket money – an emotion-driven spendingever there was one – yet  per cent of parents are struggling to manage their own finances, let alone supporting their children.The pair have five children between them and they wanted to teach them the true value of money. MoneyMatiX, they say, was born out of the desire to create adult financial role \u2028models that can pass on healthy money habits to the next generation.“Our aim is to help transform lives by creating financially capable communities,” say Matembe and Rodger. “In our work, we remind people that besides death, dealing with money is the most unavoidable aspect of le.“Closely linked to this is the fact that people are emotional beings, meaning that all habits are a mixture of several learnings, experiences and exposure that merges into personalities.“Fintech companies like MoneyMatiX can help influence this phase of habit formation, which in turn influences spending practices.“Technology can help drive financial conversations and shape the experiences and exposure to money, helping create a healthy spending environment.“With the emergence of sophisticated technologies like articial intelligence and Blockchain, the opportunity to role-model healthy spending habits – especially for the next generation – is ripe.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon theresa may s departure enhances case for indyref2","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Theresas Mays departure as Prime Minister makes the case for a second Scottish independence referendum more pressing, Nicola Sturgeon has said.But Scots Tory leader Ruth Davidson rejected the call and warned that the new Prime Minister must show a commitment to Scotlands place in the union.The First Minister warned that the prospect of a hardline Brexiteer replacing Mrs May as \"deeply concerning\" as it could mean the UK being ripped out of the EU without a deal on future arrangements.The SNP leader has already set out plans for a second referendum in the next two years and indicated that she is preparing to seek a Section  order, which would allow this, from Mrs Mays eventual successor.\"The prospect of an even more hardline Brexiteer now becoming PM and threatening a no deal exit is deeply concerning,\" Ms Sturgeon said on Twitter.\"Added to the experience of the past three years, this makes it all the more important that Scotland is given the choice of becoming an independent country.\"The SNP leader also stepped up calls for a second independence referendum. \"Her departure will not solve the Brexit mess that the Tories have created,\" Ms Sturgeon said.\"Only putting the matter back to the people can do that.

She remains a dedicated public servant, patriot and loyal Conservative.”Jeremy HuntThe Foreign Secretary is understood to have delivered a decisive blow to May’s premiership when he met her on Thursday and said she did not have the support of her Cabinet or party in offering MPs a vote on whether to hold a second Brexit referendum, as part of the proposed Withdrawal Agreement Bill.Tory insiders say the former Remainer could find himself in the last two, up against Brexit campaign leader Boris Johnson - although Hunt has since changed his view and now says the UK should be prepared to leave the EU without a deal.Hunt, who was previously Health Secretary responded on twitter: “I want to pay tribute to the PM today.

Reports suggest he could already have as many as  MPs lined up in his camp. However, he has been a leading supporter of the Prime Minister’s Brexit compromise talks with Labour, which have enraged Brexiteers.A huge fan of Game of Thrones, Gove has said his favourite character is Tyrion Lannister - the outcast who becomes right hand man to the throne.

Weep on.Brexit, in short, is nothing more than the Tories wanting to disconnect the UK from the EU, and connect itself directly to the USA, purely for themto benefit from the privatising of most government responsibilities and duties of care to US companies. It is, regrettably, as simple as that. Brexit, was nothing to do with the greater good for everybody, but for the few who would benefit####typical tory policy, # look after number , and screw everybody  in the process #, political ideology.*If* the Tories intent is to disconnect the UK from the EU and connect it directly to the USA, why is everything the government has put on the table so far and fought hard to sell to the nation as #Brexit#, proposals that will KEEP the nation well and truly in the EU in all but name, but on considerably worse terms than our current membership As far as I am aware Michael, % of British businesses deal with the EU. However, this is separate from the business of Government, and its duties to serve the people and the country. It is well known the Tories would love to privatise most Government#s responsibilities and duties of care to the private sector, where they themselves would benefit. It is also well known, the preferred country outwith the UK, to takeover such responsibilities to be the USA. Yes, the Government has a partial responsibility to acknowledge a large part of British business deals with the EU###as said though, international business and Government responsibility are two separate issues. The Government would prefer private business to take over their duties and respnsibilities no matter how you paint the picture.Less and less businesses are doing transactions in the Britishstate,with the isolationists causing a £ billion net outflow of over £ billion of assets to be shted because of brexit , # before it even commences.The main winners have been Luxembourg and Dublin,a factor maybe in why Ireland is progressing towards being the third wealthiest nation by .The separatists loss and Europe#s gain.@ David Spence.Just about every so-called Brexit #deal# put in front of parliament by the current Tories has included some element of a customs union with the EU. *If* the Tories intent is to detach from the EU and attach to the USA, the quickest, easiest and simplest method would be a #no deal# Brexit, which is something they seem intent on committing electoral suicide to avoid considering. The evidence doesn#t support your claim that the Tories want to detach from the EU and attach to the USA, as anything less than a #no deal# Brexit makes such a transition more dficult to establish and sustain.What evidence is there that the Government wants #private business to take over their duties and responsibilities#, and what#s wrong with itthey are  Private business left to market forces but subject to an effective statutory regulatory framework, is far more capable of providing a VFM service than any Government.Evenit doesn#t work, its only for a max of  years, then we vote in someone  to change it. There is no need to fear change not cast in tablets of stone.In fairness Ian has also previously judged Alex Salmond guilty before the facts, but still, theres evidence of something  in his earlier attack. Ian asked: “Is this woman being disingenuous or is she just plain stupid ” He could instead have asked“Nicola Sturgeon”, or “the First Minister” or even“she” was being disingenuous or just plain stupid. Instead Ian opted to emphasise her gender by starting with “this woman”. Five words later Ian added an otherwise redundant “she”, lest readers had forgotten his target wasn’t male.This from the same Ian who is fond of saying gender is not an issue. Doth Ian protest too much Ian made his smear more effective by offering a choice between two negatives in his rhetorical “or” question. The First Minister can only be a liar or an idiot. Neat trick!

Farage could be replaced by a blow up dummy with a recorded message attached to it, and it would make little dference, the vote is to support the principle of Brexit, and not much of anything to do with a somewhat unlikeable little man.Fantastic, even the French agree “I consider that the British people decided to leave the European Union and the faster Britain leaves the better,” Le Maire told reporters. and the faster Britain leaves the better,” Le Maire told reporters.

They were among the first pioneers in planting English and Scots settlers in Ireland. But by , Smiths settlement failed and the lands reverted to the crown.On  May , King James I granted the Ballymena Estate to another native Irish nobleman, Ruairiacute Oacuteg MacQuillan. The estate passed through several owners, eventually passing into the possession of William Adair, a Scottish laird from Kinhilt in southwestern Scotland.The estate was temporarily renamed Kinhiltstown after Adairs lands in Scotland. The original castle of Ballymena was built in the early th century, situated to take advantage of an ancient ford at the River Braid.In  Charles I confirmed the grant of the Ballymena Estate to William Adair, giving him the right to hold a market at Ballymena on every Saturday. He hired local Irish as workers on the estate they served as tenant farmers for much of the next two centuries and more.And from those early days, Ballymena became a commercial hub for central Co. Antrim, steadily growing in prosperity through the years of the linen boom in the th century.Until recent years, the traditional market had been held at the area known as the Fair Hill on lands bordered by upper Broughshane Street, William Street and Thomas Street.When the area was sold for the development of what is now the Fair Hill Shopping Centre, the Saturday market was moved to its current venue near the Seven Towers Leisure Centre.And that is pretty much where the whole tradition kicked off nearly  years ago as the site is pretty much right in the front garden of what used to be the Adair familys residence in Ballymena!Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is urging you to come enjoy, explore and love your local market this May as part of UK wide campaign to support our local traders. ‘Love Your Local Market’ runs from - May.

The urban beach has been designed by award winning designer Ian Price, who has devised a space which will accommodate a number of community activities planned for the Ballymena beach this summer.It will be a flexible area that has plenty of space for laying out the beach towels, a dedicated sand sculpture section, and a jetty style promenade.The main feature of the urban beach will be a lighthouse, which is something that Ballymena residents will not be used to seeing in their People’s Park.The space will also be used to host an outdoor cinema and other public s throughout the summer.

Alec is one of  plus people who will be taking part in the exhilarating annual cycling and running event on June  to help raise funds for Cancer Focus Northern Ireland.Alec formerly played for Ballymena United and, back in the s and s, he also played gaelic football at inter-county and provincial level. As well as gaelic football and soccer, he also found time to play rugby for Armoy RFC. He continues to be involved with the local Con Magees, Glenravel Gaelic Club.GOLFERHis main outdoor pastime now is golf and he is a member of local Ballymena Golf Club.While not a regular cyclist, he has taken part in the FROG for many years.Alec is the chairperson of the Glenravel Community Development Association, which is responsible for the operation of the Glenravel Sports and Community Complex – which hosts the FROG event.The complex includes sports facilities, a health and fitness suite, a community play group and has become established as the social hub for the local community. A wide range of fitness and activity classes is provided for the local community with some  dferent classes running every week.“The complex is approaching its th anniversary since first opening, and we’re delighted to host FROG, which is the largest annual event we are involved with,” said Alec.SUPPORT“Cancer Focus NI is a very special organisation to raise funds for. They do a tremendous amount of work supporting local cancer patients and their families, doing cancer prevention work in the community, funding research at Queen’s University and advocating for better health policies.“Cancer touches so many of us. My brother, Liam, was diagnosed with cancer back in  and had to have a kidney removed. “This was a very challenging time for him and the family. I can fully appreciate the impact that a cancer diagnosis can have on a family. “Thankfully, he has recovered well and has been participating in FROG for the past  years and fully intends to take part in FROG again this year,” he added. “FROG has grown tremendously since it began  years ago and now attracts over  cyclists. We are also building up the number of runners taking part, which is an exciting development.“A lot of preparation goes into organising FROG and the event runs like clockwork. “Organiser Paul McToal and his team deserve a tremendous amount of credit for the work they have put in over the past  years. The event has now become established as a firm date in the cycling calendar for many cyclists and cycling clubs. “While we are well supported by other cycling clubs from right across Northern Ireland, we’d love even more people to join in.“The glens is a fantastic route, so much scenery to enjoy, and there’s a real feel-good factor and tremendous buzz. “The weather has also been very kind to us over the years. What better way to get fresh air, exercise, meet people and help an extremely worthy cause ”COURSEEntrants can choose the FROG cycle, either a mile, mile or  mile route, or FROG legs, a km or  mile run – there’s something for everyone.Participants who raise a minimum amount for Cancer Focus NI will receive a special commemorative top.

Farm attacks in South Africa are reported almost on a daily basis to the rest of the world and must be condemned. There is no denying they happen, the tragic results are plain to see. But what can be done about it  How does this affect how other farmers get on with le and their daily work I’ve been fortunate enough to visit and report from South Africa on five separate occasions now over the past  years and come away each time with a sense of dismissal but also hope.South Africa is a beautul country, physically, and produces some of the best food and wine demanded by consumers around the world.Politically, it’s a dferent place. A place where the state is not in charge. A state that cannot even control its basic power supply, without some form of corruption.But where does that leave agriculture and the farmers  No matter what political persuasion anyone holds, everyone must eat. Over the years of visiting farms in South Africa I noticed farmers becoming despondent, feeling let down, feeling a sense of ‘what’s the point of it all ’I’ve talked to farmers who were attacked, who lost loved ones, and who gave up.However, during my latest visit in early March this year I witnessed a positivity among farmers that really I never experienced before.Yes, nothing politically has changed, except for the worst, but farmers are more defiant, more ambitious and are investing to make their farms more efficient in order to give them a future.During the big livestock equipment show EuroTier in Germany last November I talked to a few South African farmers interested to see how technology could make their farms more efficient. It was really comforting to visit a number of farmers on this trip who are putting new technology to play in order to improve their businesses. Visiting Greenway Farms Ltd with headquarters at Tarlton to see how business partners Vito Rugani and Vincent Sequeira handle over , tonnes of carrots per year grown on , hectares was really inspiring.The passion and ambition shown by these leading vegetable farmers has resulted in a range of Rugani juices that are now being exported across the world. They have invested heavily in new state of the art equipment to extract juice from vegetables. The science is baffling, the set-up is extremely professional and as for the juice, well…..I have to admit this was the first time I ever tried carrot juice and it was absolutely delicious. The knowledge I gained from Vito and his team will stay with me for a long time. I just hope he finds a way to export the range to the UK!Next visit was to Corne Nel’s Doornfontein Melkery in Randfontein where they milk  cows. Dairy unit manager Pieter Barnard gave me a very informative tour around the farm.Having been brought up on a dairy farm myself in Northern Ireland this visit was particularly interesting and I was also impressed to see more investment in equipment to make le easier. A new rotary parlour installed two years ago certainly speeds milking time up and perhaps investment into robotic milkers will help too with the dferent milking groups in the future. The sun can be a challenge where livestock are concerned and it was good to hear plans to build new housing in the corals to keep the cows cooler. With excellent production figures and a sound understanding of the cows, this farm is certainly gearing up for an exciting future.Before travelling across the border to visit farms in Botswana I went to see Sarel Haasbroek’s grain farm in the Carletonville area of Gauteng. Again this is another progressive farmer positive about the future and was excelling in importing the Horsch machinery brand into South Africa. Up in Francistown, eastern Botswana, I was warmly hosted by the Munger family at Wayside Brahman Stud Ltd for four nights. During my stay there I was given a comprehensive run down of the breeding herd, commercial herd, game farm, and the egg laying enterprise. What a farm! Rowland and his son Rowly are certainly well respected in the area and for the cattle they produce. Wayside was started by Rowland’s father Keith who was also present during my visit. And then it was off to see another beef farmer, this time with Bonsmara cattle, Calla Visser, for a very early start checking his cattle. Every night Calla has to go and round up over  cattle on his farm and herd them into outdoor corals for the night to protect them against theft and predators such as hyenas or leopards!And, every next morning Calla and his staff start very early going around the five dferent corals on his , hectare farm counting all the cows, calves and bulls hoping they all made it through the night alive.This, of course, is a new line of management for me but was nonetheless interesting to learn. A visit to Bobbsies Chickens Ltd based in the east at Tshesebe guided by general manager Gerhard van der Merwe was another super visit. Botswana, too, impressed me, as did the farmers there. I received detailed insight into the beef and poultry industries there and look forward to the next time I can visit.Some of the Botswanans though need to learn how to drive!

Over the years my da became sole owner of the butchers, it was always called A’town Meats,” he said.Gerald said his father was the eldest of five children and that Tom’s three brothers and late sister all emigrated to Canada, with his father opting to stay in Ireland to raise his young family.“At one stage he had opened up a butchers shop in Poleglass, inside a group of shops at the time and a shop in Ladybrook which my brother Vincent ran. Dad sold the business in September  and stayed on because it was coming up to Christmas, up to the Christmas club and what is a very busy time. After Christmas he stayed on, right up until around March, April time when he started to feel unwell. He was told it was cancer and started radiotherapy in October last year.”Gerald continued: “The Christmas period was very bad as he was very anxious waiting on results following the treatment. It wasn’t that he got the all clear, but he was told everything seemed ‘positive’. He knew by the end of January, early February something wasn’t right, the pain started coming back and he was told that ‘it’ was back.“A week or so later he was told that it was terminal.”“He was in hospital about a fortnight and we took him out to bring him home. He was only out three weeks and one day when he passed away.”Gerald spoke poignantly of how A’town Meats was known as a “meeting place, a place for people to come and talk”.“People would come in for a yarn, for many it was their way of getting out of the house and a chance for conversation.”Gerald said his father was a founding member of the Donegal Celtic Football Club and loved the GAA, especially local clubs Lamh Dhéarg and Rossa.“Last year was the best year of his le as he got closer to his kids. He was always working. His kids, his grandkids,you wanted to go see him you went to the shop. Eventhe children were being baptised, made their communions, their confirmations, you brought them to the shop. He was there six-days a week. I would have seen him on Christmas Day going into the shop and getting burgers, getting whatever was needed for restaurants who would’ve contacted him needing food. He went round, opened up and made sure they were catered for.”As well as a prominent businessman, Gerald said his father was a “bookmaker as well”.“He applied his trade at Celtic Park, Drumbo, Dundalk and Dunmore, it was a hobby as much as anything . He loved to see people winning.”He added: “One of the first times he ever done the book, a fella ended up owing him over £, and he said he would have it up to the shop that Tuesday. When the guy came up to the shop, my da was still meeting and greeting the customers, they came first, they were the be all and end all.“Dad gave the man a large meat parcel and said to him ‘take that down to the house with you’. The fella said it was the first time he had owed someone money, paid it and actually left ‘with a smile on his face’. The fella brought it down to his family and they were saying how nice the meat was and he replied: ‘Well of course it is, it cost me £,!’”Gerald said his father could pick up on when his customers were going through hardship.“He knew without them having to say anything. He would give them some food just to help them out, he never spoke of it, it was the people who would come in and tell you how he had helped.“A wee woman came into the shop one Christmas and she couldn’t afford the turkey so she said she was just going to take a ‘wee chicken this year’ and offered a ring as a means of payment. He wouldn’t hear of it but the wee woman insisted on giving over the ring. The wee woman passed away and her daughters came into the shop months later and he said he had something belonging to them and brought out the ring.“He was a very private man and religious in his own ways. He would’ve walked from his house in Donegall Park to Clonard, walked down for the Rosary and to St Paul’s as well. He always kept himself fit, he did Slimming World in his ’s and went out of his way to get the accreditation to sell the Slimming World endorsed food in the shop. He had people coming from all over to buy it.“He was always reading and went back to get his Degree in History. He loved the horses, he was always saying I would ‘scud’ his bets, that I was the worst ‘picker in the world’.“At the end of the day he was a very hard working, very generous, honest man. All his le he would’ve said ‘I’m doing this for you, I’m doing this for you’, in terms of working so hard at the business. He loved his family.”Gerald’s daughter and Tom’s granddaughter, Charleen Straney, described her “granda” as “a much loved man and very highly thought of by everyone who got to know him.”Tom Straney’s Requiem Mass will take place todayin St Agnes’ Church at noon."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"finucane new lord mayor of belfast","story":"JOHN Finucane said his father was in his thoughts as he was officially made the new Lord Mayor of Belfast last night.The Sinn Féin councillor, a new face on Belfast City Council, was nominated by the party for the position of the city’s first citizen.John’s father, prominent Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane was shot dead in  by a state-controlled loyalist gang in front of his family.Speaking in the Chamber at the council’s AGM on Tuesday evening, John said: “Tonight is a special night for them and, of course, for me.“And of course never far from my thoughts, more so on a night like tonight, is my father Pat. “I know my dad would be proud tonight as my entire family are, as am I, of the position being elected Mayor of Belfast places me in.”John added that his focus for the year ahead will be on ersity and inclusiveness.“As Mayor, I want to bring a message of ersity and inclusiveness to the year ahead.“I have been brought up and lived my le in an inclusive, welcoming environment where dference and ersity are embraced and celebrated, and I am proud of that.“I am the product of a mixed marriage, of a Catholic father from West Belfast, and a Protestant mother from East Belfast. “I have relatives who are unionist and I have relatives who are republican. “My upbringing has shown me that everyone deserves to be, and must be, treated equally.“I want a strong, vibrant Belfast in which political persuasion, sexuality, religious choice or skin colour make no dference as to how a citizen is treated. “I want a Belfast where we champion the rights of the most vulnerable in our society and do so proudly, without fear, without favour.“I will never accept that undeniable rights are merely privileges, to be given and taken from those in need by those in power. “It is my intention as Mayor to convene a special conference to celebrate the vibrancy and ersity in this city and to show how that fantastic ersity can enrich our city and the lives of all our citizens.“As Mayor I will reach out the hand of friendship and do my best to help build a future we can all be proud of.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rio is on the ball on the springfield road","story":"FORMER Manchester United and England footballer Rio Ferdinand was in West Belfast on Tuesday to officially open the new office of one of the UK’s top football agencies at the Innovation Factory on the Springfield Road.Rio is an ambassador for New Era Global Sports Management, which is the first big name football agency to open an office in the North –their first office outside of London.New Era Global Sports believes in a holistic approach, supporting players throughout their careers and into retirement and Rio is hopeful the agency can make an impact here.“There has been so many good Irish players – Roy Keane, Robbie Keane, Jonny and Corry Evans, John O’Shea, Craig Cathcart, I could go on,” said Rio.“There are loads here and there will be more coming through.“It is about nurturing and creating the pathway for these players. The amount of lads leaving here for England but ing a year later is far too high. It is not about their football ability but due to a lack of support network for them.“There is that fear factor of moving away and we want to help them stay on the ladder.“It is an important moment for New Era. There is so much talent in Ireland and now we have a place to facilitate them.”The Innovation Factory office will be run by former professional footballer, Lee Mudd, who says the agency was drawn by the vast untapped potential talent throughout the island of Ireland.“There are a lot of talented young players here and having an office in Belfast will provide them with the opportunity to make it on a bigger stage. We currently have  players on our books from Ireland and Northern Ireland and I would expect this to grow considerably in a short time as there is so much potential here.“We recognise that it is an enormous challenge for a young person to leave this country and go to live in England. It is important to provide them with a support network. It can be a tough, ruthless environment and they need a caring team behind them to look after them, not just now but throughout their careers.”Lee points to the example of New Era Ambassador, Rio Ferdinand who has seen many highs and lows during his career and is now a successful businessman, media pundit and mentor to many young professionals.“Rio has been with New Era since the start and is the perfect example of how the company has helped him on his journey and shown him that there is a le after playing football. We want young players here to have access to all that experience.“We are in a growth phase and the Innovation Factory gives us the chance to build our business and increase capacity as needed. We also liked the networking opportunities with other businesses that have ambitious plans it offers us the chance to feed off this energy and new ideas”Shane Smith, Innovation Factory’s Community Engagement Officer added:“We are very excited to welcome such a prestigious sports agency to Northern Ireland.“New Era Sports has recognised the facilities and support we have to offer and we look forward to helping them expand their activities in Northern Ireland.”"},{"url":null,"title":"arlene foster pays tribute to theresa may with pm set to stand down","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But the process must not be derailed nor responsibility abdicated in respect of people’s rights and agreements.”UUP leader Robin Swann praised Mrs May personally and said that she loved her country and was committed to the union.However, he said that a change of leader would not necessarily solve the Brexit crisis and the Irish border backstop must be dealt with.“The country is deeply ided and the Prime Minister`s successor will have to seek to heal those isions whilst delivering a Brexit which maintains the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom,\" Mr Swann said. \"The new Prime Minister should have all four corners of our nation at the forefront of their thinking when they are making defining decisions about the future direction of the United Kingdom. They should have an absolute commitment to the maintenance of the Union and the prosperity of all its people.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said that the Brexit situation had led to Mrs Mays downfall.He said that Brexit was \"fundamentally an undeliverable prospect\".“I have disagreed with Theresa May almost every single step of the way over the course of the last three years,\" the Foyle MLA said.\"Triggering Article  with no plan to prevent a hard border in Ireland, reneging politically on the agreed terms of the backstop and stubbornly refusing to call a halt to the madness that has consumed Westminster.\"It is undeniable, however, that she has exhausted every avenue to find agreement in the House of Commons. The simple fact remains, however, that there is clearly no consensus to be found.“The European Union has already said very clearly that the withdrawal agreement is not up for renegotiation. A new Prime Minister should recognise the mistakes made by Theresa May, revoke Article  and put an end to this political, diplomatic and economic car crash.”The Chief Executive of the Northern Ireland Camber of Commerce and Industry thanked Mrs May for her recent visits to Northern Ireland.“Any leadership contest must be swt and followed urgently by a clear plan to break the impasse. Westminster has already squandered far too much time going around in circles on Brexit,\" Ann McGregor said.“Regardless of who is in Downing Street, a new Prime Minister must work to avert a messy and disorderly exit from the EU and provide firms with stability and answers. They will expect practical solutions to a number of issues that are still unclear ranging from trade agreements, migration rules and customs.”Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said that Mrs May left the UK in a worse place than she found it.“No matter who now replaces her, the same problems will still persist – they will face stark choices regarding Brexit and its consequences, and they need to approach them with honesty and realism,\" he said.“Given the time needed to conduct the process to select a new Conservative leader and Prime Minister, it is likely another extension to Article  will be required,we are to not leave the EU with no deal. The next Prime Minister must push for a People’s Vote and allow people to Remain now they know the mess Brexit will bring.”"},{"url":null,"title":"asian couple win racism case against northern ireland car dealer","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Wong went back to John Mulholland Motors on the agreed date to collect their new car.Mr Wongs first language is English. His wes first language is Cantonese. He conducted this business with Mulhollands in English throughout.The price of the new car remained unchanged, but their balance payment was more because they were no longer trading their old car in. As it was a joint purchase and a large amount of money, to make sure she fully understood the change and what they were signing up to, Mr Wong discussed it with Ms Law in Cantonese. At this stage the couple were told several times by the sales staff to have their conversation in English. The couple alleged that the salesperson believed incorrectly that Ms Law could understand the detailsthey were told to her in English, despite them explaining that she was unable to fully understandthey only used English to communicate.Mr Wong found the way the sales staff dealt with them - asking them several times to speak only in English - was rude and aggressive and said there was no handshake upon completion.Delivering his judgment, Judge Gilpin said that he was satisfied the way the sales staff had dealt with the couple had \"created a degrading and humiliating environment\".Mr Wong said: \"I felt we were treated very badly and were disrespected by the company. \"We were interrupted and told to speak English because we are in the UK. \"The atmosphere in which this transaction took place was strained and my we was so distressed she was reduced to tears and no one apologised to her. \"I was unable to make a complaint to Mulhollands on the day because nobody senior was available. Im glad that we won our case.\"The couples case was supported by the Equality Commission.Dr Michael Wardlow, chief commissioner of the Equality Commission, said: \"The law says it is unlawful for a service provider to provide a service of a lower or worse standard to iniduals on the grounds of their colour, race, nationality, ethnic or national origin.\"John Mulholland Motors said it was disappointed with the courts findings and was giving further consideration to the judgment.A spokesperson said: \"The business has been trading for over  years and in that time has welcomed literally hundreds of thousands of visitors to our showrooms.\"John Mulholland Motors pride themselves in consistently delivering excellent customer service to customers from all backgrounds and nationalities in a welcoming environment. \"This is borne out by numerous industry awards.

The fatal flaws still remain. The backstop is still there meaning Northern Ireland could be cut off from its main market in Great Britain by a new regulatory border. \"Unless there are treaty level changes, Brussels would always have the whip hand.\"Mrs May yesterday set out a -point compromise package in her final attempt to secure approval for her deal, which has already been rejected in Parliament three times.She is to offer MPs a vote on whether to hold a second Brexit referendum in a last-ditch effort to secure support in the House of Commons.Her new Brexit deal, which was agreed by Cabinet only after a stormy two-hour session, will be brought to Parliament in the first week of next month.As well as a vote on a second referendum, MPs will be offered a choice over the UKs future customs arrangements with the European Union.TUV leader Jim Allister rounded on the Prime Minister for opening the door to a second referendum. He said Mrs Mays deal was nothing new but \"rather another attempt to force her failed, rejected plan through Westminster\".He added: \"What it does contain is another massive climbdown this time on a second referendum.

Effectively, it leaves us in the waiting room for Irish unity,\" he added.Sinn Fein vice president Michelle ONeill said: \"The majority of people of the North did not consent to Brexit and rejected it at the polls. \"The new offer announced by Theresa May contains little new thinking. Westminster is in chaos and what we heard today from Theresa May will do little to convince the business community or anyone  here that is likely to change.\"Ulster Unionist EU election candidate Danny Kennedy said: \"The very fact that the Prime Minister has made this speech less than  hours before polls open in an election to the European Parliament is symptomatic of the chaotic state of her Government at this time. The fact remains there should never have been a backstop in the first place and it was poor negotiations that resulted in its inclusion.\" Alliance leader Naomi Long said: \"Those saying the case for another vote was delusional have been proven wrong. We have not left the EU yet - the decision can be reversed and Brexit stopped.\"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would consider the Prime Ministers plan, but warned: \"We wont back a repackaged version of the same old deal, and its clear that this weak and disintegrating Government is unable deliver on its own commitments.\"Mrs Mays proposals were immediately rejected by Tory Brexiteers. Boris Johnson tweeted: \"We are being asked to vote for a customs union and a second referendum. The Bill is directly against our manesto - and I will not vote for it.

Hotels currently have a wage content of around % of turnover.\"The sector has a iety of roles from entry level at the appropriate national minimum wage level of the candidate through to supervisory, management and executive roles.\"The Federation has not seen the evidence that the LPC received last week and therefore is not in a position to answer the specics. Nor have the NIHF been made aware of working conditions contra to current national minimum wage levels by any trade union official or employee in the Derry-Londonderry area.\"Ms Gault added: \"Allegations of this nature are very damaging and without having specic examples are impossible to abate.\"As an industry we have done much to improve our image: improving working hours, providing strong and well rewarded career paths and supporting qualications that give employees the opportunity to have greater skills to work globally.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Niall McCarroll, chairman of the Derry Trades Union Council, and members of Aegis in meeting with the Low Pay Commission."},{"url":null,"title":"foyle hospice weekly draw results winner","story":"Winners in this weeks Foyle Hospice Weekly Draw are - st prize: £,, Paul Breslinnd prize: £,, Rollover : rd prize: £, Terry Monaghanth prize: £, Diarmuid Campbellth prize: £, William Linton .googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"spencer road closed traffic travelling city side","story":"Traffic travelling from Craigavon Bridge is currently being erted away from Spencer Road after a bus became stuck at the junction of Spencer Road and Fountain Hill.It is the same junction where lorries have become stuck in recent months.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe PSNI said: \"Spencer Road and Fountain Hill remain closed due to a vehicle blocking both Roads and will be for a period of time.\"Please avoid the area and delays should be expected.

Some say while those carrying out the work are obliging, they are not responsible the delay or the lack of communication.Businesses are also hoping that customers they have not seen for some time willwhen Irish Street s to a sense of normality.They say the loss of parking spaces has impacted on trade with the work forcing people not to use one of the townrsquos main car parks nearby.During last weekrsquos protest, one trader revealed that her business has been forced to go mobile, visiting the homes of elderly people who cannot safely access her premises in the town centre due to the public realm scheme.Restaurant owner Mizba Uddin says things have been ldquoterrible for his business since work on the project began.ldquoThe business has literally collapsed, he declared, standing outside his restaurant surrounded by barriers used by contractors.ldquoThe situation is very, very bad and we have even have people driving down the one-way system the wrong way. Parking spaces have been lost as a result of the work and not all will be ed when the scheme is completed. People are going where as we do not provide a delivery service.Mizba said one of his main concerns has been the lack of communication from those overseeing the project. He also urged those in charge of the scheme to talk to traders to let them know what is going on.He added: ldquoI was told that the scheme would end in March and have heard nothing since. I am relying on other people to tell me what is going on but it should not be like this. I cannot even clean my windows because there is so much dust everywhere.ldquoSummer time can be quiet for me. Everyone in Irish Street wants this project completed as quickly as possible. As the work continues, there are simply no customers going to any of the shops. The work is killing businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget woman’s two week walk meeting inspirational people  ","story":"A BALLYGALGET woman is one of two volunteers who are spending a fortnight walking in towns and villages around Northern Ireland meeting inspirational people who are improving their communities.Patricia Fleming, a former camogie player with Ballygalget John Mitchelrsquos GAC, called into her old club last Sunday accompanied by Rory Mullan from Derry.They were hand-picked from a raft of candidates to be Big Lunch walkers for this year.Starting last Friday, they are visiting dferent places in Northern Ireland ahead of the Big Lunch weekend on June -.The Big Lunch event is where over six million people through the UK will meet to share food and eat together.Patricia and Rory visited Ballygalget to hear about all the great work the club does in the surrounding area.Patricia, who now lives in Belfast with her family, told the club how its community work was inspiring.ldquoThe reason I picked Ballygalget is that Irsquom from here, Irsquove played on that pitch many times, but I also know the community spirit that exists within Ballygalget. It blows me away when I come home and hear all the things that are happening.ldquoWhen I went for my interview after applying to be one of the Big Lunch walkers, I said thatI was chosen I would like to bring the Big Lunch community walk into rural areas and to Ballygalget.ldquoPeople here are very community oriented. That is not the case everywhere. A lot of people donrsquot feel able to knock on their neighboursrsquo doors.The club hosted a Big Breakfast fundraiser on Sunday towards sending the clubrsquos U- boys and girls to next monthrsquos Feile in Cork.However, the club is also trying to gather support for a huge number of projects, including cross-community work and is also going to host its own event over the Big Lunch weekend.A new cross-community gym opened in the club grounds a year ago, which has proven immensely popular with all sorts of people in the local area, including many who had no links with the GAC.The new building also has space for social workshops and some of the wider community schemes the club wants to pursue.Last year, Ballygalget won an Alzheimerrsquos Society Diversity Award for its work in the community.Club member Roisin Coulter said: ldquoWe are working to become a dementia-friendly community. The idea is to educate people about dementia: what are the signs and symptoms, and how to support someone living with the condition.ldquoEvery month we run a free two-hour workshop, with materials supplied by the Alzheimerrsquos Society.ldquoOur club is very much affected by dementia. Quite a number of people in the club are living with a diagnosis within their families. We want to reduce stigma and the social isolation people can feel.Aoe Savage, Ballygalget GACrsquos Health Club Officer, added: ldquoWe are working against social isolation within our area.ldquoWe are trying to improve health and wellbeing ndash both physical and mental health ndash of people who live nearby, on a cross-community basis.Ballygalget was the walkersrsquo third stop on their tour around Northern Ireland. They have already visited Belfast and Balmoral Show.Over the next two weeks will visit other places including Lisnaskea, Portadown, Ballymoney and Derry.There is still plenty of time to sign up at www.edenprojectcommunities thebiglunchhomepage..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Businessman calls for work to be completed quickly  ","story":"IRISH Street businessman Darren Trainor said the public realm scheme needs to be completed quickly for the benefit of everyone in the town.He saidthose in charge of the scheme told traders that they planned to deploy more men to finish it earlier they would put up with the disruption for a just a little longer.And asking for businesses to be provided with up-to-date information, Mr Trainor appealed to those in charge ldquocome and talk to us.He continued: ldquoWe received a letter informing us that the work would be completed on March . We are all so frustrated that this scheme has taken so long and we have lost regular customers which over a month or two would be fair enough, but over six or seven, you are not going to get them back.ldquoWe have been in business for over  years andit was not for that we probably would have closed by now.

Among the stories he told were e the events of May , , when his antics in a penalty shoot out against Roma helped Liverpool to win the European Cup.He also talked about his career after Liverpool and working with Alan Ball at Southampton at the height of the match fixing allegations that were made against him.When Ball was asked by the media why he was playing Grobbelaar in goal ahead of England international Dave Beasant, Ball reputedly said: ldquoI would rather have Bruce in goal trying to throw the game than Dave doing his best to save it.By common consensus, Bruce was one of the best speakers the club has had and has whetted the appetite for the future to renew the clubrsquos tradition of bringing over guest speakers.Bruce was presented with a small gt from the club by youth team coach Simon Thornton, a set of golf balls and towel from the Royal County Down Golf Club.Club secretary Andy Hall then spoke for a few minutes to highlight some of the highs and lows of the last  years and to thank IFA regional development officer Seamus Heath for all the work he does in promoting football across the Newry Mourne and Down Council area.Andy then invited IFA vice-chairman Jack Grundie to say a few words with Jack presenting the club with a gt to mark the occasion.County Antrim FA president Jim Jess also spoke warmly about the club and presented a memento to mark the occasion with Maurice Johnston, vice chair of the Mid Ulster Football League, congratulating the club on their th anniversary and presenting Tollymore chairman John McIlvenny with a gt to recognise the achievement.Newcastle League secretary Alan Craig was unfortunately taken ill before the dinner and was unable to attend and the club sends its warm wishes to him for a speedy recovery.The final official speaker was Elaine Junk, the former chair of the NI Womenrsquos Football Association during the period when Tollymore had a successful ladiesrsquo side.Elaine congratulated the club on its th anniversary and encouraged them to get a ladiesrsquo team back up and playing.With the official proceedings drawing to a close there was one last surprise with Adrian Howard presenting a le time achievement award on behalf of players and members to Andy Hall in recognition of all his work for the club.It was a wonderful gesture by the club and much appreciated by Andy.The evening concluded with dancing to the wonderful Fth Avenue with Bruce continuing to sign autographs and pose for pictures into the wee small hours..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Locals flying high in F15 championship  ","story":"ROGER Chamberlain and Charlie Horder won the Northern Ireland Flying Fteen Championship on Strangford Lough at the weekend.It was a deserved triumph for the Whiterock duo and also for Strangford Sailing Club, which hosted the event less than a month after the re-opening of its clubhouse which was gutted by an accidental fire in September .The five-race championship attracted a -strong fleet, which included a sizeable contingent of southern visitors, mainly from Dun Laoghaire.After three races on Saturday Chamberlain and Horder were in third place, behind Killyleagh pair Andrew McCleery and Colin Dougan mdash who got off to a flyer by winning the opening race mdash and overnight leaders Brian McKee and John Gibson, also from Whiterock, who were second and seventh in the first two races before winning the final race of the day.Chamberlain and Horder came out of the blocks early on Sunday and comfortably won the fourth race before sealing the championship with fth place in the final race.McKee and Gibson were a disappointing th in the fourth race, but with the discard brought into play, they still had a chance of outright victory.

beyond his power’ in Loughinisland report  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos Police Ombudsman went beyond his legal powers in publishing a report ldquoreplete with determinations that RUC officers colluded with loyalists in the Loughinisland massacre, the Court of Appeal heard last week.Lawyers for two retired senior policemen claimed the watchdogrsquos damning findings on the Loughinisland atrocity should only have been releasedit had recommended prosecutions or disciplinary action against any of those under scrutiny.Judgment was reserved in the renewed bid by Raymond White and Ronald Hawthorne to have the report quashed.UVF gunmen opened fire at the Heights Bar in Loughinisland, Co Down as their victims watched a World Cup football match in June .The men killed were: Adrian Rogan , Malcolm Jenkinson , Barney Green , Daniel McCreanor , Patrick OrsquoHareand Eamon Byrne .Five others were also wounded in a sectarian attack for which no-one has been brought to justice.In June  the Ombudsman, Dr Michael Maguire, said collusion between some officers and the loyalists was a signicant feature in the murders.He found no evidence police had prior knowledge, but identied ldquocatastrophic failings in the investigation.Mr White, representing the Northern Ireland Retired Police Officersrsquo Association, and Mr Hawthorne, a former sub-isional police commander, have been involved in a long-running legal challenge to the published findings.A first hearing resulted in a ruling in  that the report was procedurally unfair and had failed to make clear it conclusions did not apply to Mr Hawthorne.At that time the watchdog agreed to remove any references to him to ensure he is not connected to any alleged wrongdoing mdash a move seen as complete vindication for the former police commander.A limited re-hearing before a dferent judge focused only on issues around the extent of the powers to publish the findings.In November last year a High Court judge rejected the retired officersrsquo case that Dr Maguire had exceeded his legal remit.Mr White and Mr Hawthorne are now now appealing that ruling.The former policemenrsquos barrister, David McMillen QC, stressed their complete support for the Ombudsmanrsquos role in scrutinising and holding officers to account.He argued, however, that the watchdog lacked the legislative authority to publish such ldquoconclusive findings in the Loughinisland report.ldquoHe simply does not have that power, Mr McMillen said.ldquoThis is an organ of the state, an important and very public organ of the state finding police officers guilty.Askedhe believed the Ombudsmanrsquos report had concluded police officers may have committed criminal offences, Mr McQuillen replied: ldquoIt was replete with those suggestions.But Mr McMillen rejected suggestions that the document could be amended to state there ldquomay be evidence of criminal or disciplinary offences.ldquoThe report is so infected with conclusive language all the way through, about what he found, that a simple rider would not make sense, he said.Barra McGrory QC, for the Ombudsman, countered that the legislation allowed him to express an opinion on the alleged collusion.He said: ldquoThe definition the Ombudsman has set out on collusion is broad enough to encompass behaviour and actions by police officers which cannot be identied as specic criminal offences which could be referredunder that part of the scheme.Following submissions Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, sitting with Lord Justices Stephens and Deeny,

authority had asked them to recycle.The survey mdash carried out by polling and market research organisation Lucid Talk mdash revealed that only % of those surveyed would recycle when it was convenient for them.The survey revealed that of those who said they would recycle only when it was convenient, % indicated that they would be encouraged to recycle morethere was one bin that took all recycling, including glass mdash a service that until last month was unavailable in the former Down Council area.In addition, the survey showed that where the council area could lsquocomminglersquo glass in the same bin with the rest of their household recyclables mdash plastic, paper, card, tins and cardboard etc mdash householders were on average % happy with their glass collection method, compared to % of those in council areas that did not.Re-Gen Waste Ltd managing director, Joseph Doherty, said the survey results indicated that prioritising simplicity and convenience was the best approach to ensuring a high level of household recycling.He continued: ldquoSince April , glass can now be commingled with household recycling waste in the Down legacy council area, meaning that all householders across Newry, Mourne and Down can now put their glass into their blue bins.ldquoWe should see an marked improvement in recycling figures and a decrease in the percentage of glass placed in black bins across the entire council area.Mr Doherty said local authorities need to encourage the maximum number of people to recycle the maximum volume of materials, weighed against the cost of processing the material, and the potential financial benefits from reducing landfill costs, and selling on recyclable material.ldquoThe councils we with work in Northern Ireland, England and Scotland tell us that household friendly schemes such as commingling recyclables, plastic, paper, card, tins and cardboard and glass in one bin, are much preferable to residents than any pre-sort scheme using smaller containers or bins and that it is actively improving their recycling rates, he said.Last March, of the households in the Newry, Mourne and Down area that could commingle their glass with their recyclables in the same bin, % of respondents said they would recycle lessthey had to separate their household waste, including glass waste into separate caddies.Mr Doherty added: ldquoMore and more local authorities are seeing the benefits and cost savings achieved by switching to commingling collection services, alongside an ultra-modern Materials Recycling Facilitylike ours that receives, separates and prepares recyclables for productive use where.The Lucid Talk survey was carried out across all of Northern Irelandrsquos  district council

Kielty has called for an end to the segregation of education along religious lines in Northern Ireland.He believes that someone like Good Friday Agreement peace talks chairman George Mitchell could be the man tasked with the job of overhauling the countryrsquos ldquoided schools.At an Ulster University event in Belfast last week focusing on sectarianism, the Dundrum man said the segregated education issue needed to be addressed.He also criticised what he described as the ldquocasual sectarianism and ldquotribalism which characterises parts of society.He continued: ldquoI think we really have to address education, segregated education and I think that as a society we kind of have to start calling out that casual sectarianism.ldquoWhenever we had peace here we thoughtwe move on to a Glaswegian level of sectarianism that is fine, so we only hate each other every week when we go to football. That is not good enough. The tribalism of that is not good enough.The comedian also suggested that the integrated education term was ldquoinsulting.He explained: ldquoAround the rest of the world that is called education. What we have in this country is segregated education.The Dundrum man also paid tribute to the ldquobrilliant work of teachers but said people felt those high standards were enough and did not tackle the underlying ision.ldquoThe natural  of mixing and realising that we are exactly the same and having a school that has got a rugby team and a GAA team, you donrsquot have to go to that schoolyou like GAA. There are just certain things that we really need to have a look at and I am not sure that we are necessarily ready for it.Speaking at the Belfast event, Mr Kielty argued that changing the education system would have to be done by an international figure like former US senator George Mitchell.ldquoOnce we actually get through it we will go, lsquogee why didnrsquot we do that before now rsquo, but it is a dficult one, he conceded, suggesting that social media is contributing to the lack of exposure to dferent views.ldquoYour own opinion is folded back into yourself on the screen every day, he said. ldquoMore than ever, we actually have to put the screen down and make an effort to realise that we are the same.ldquoWe talk too much about dference here. You are either a British person living on the island of Ireland or you are an Irish person who is currently actually in the UK. You are actually a bit of both.Mr Kielty added: ldquoThe minute that we accept that that is going to move in a fluid way, and it is perfectly fine to be a bit of both, that is kind of where we need to be.Meanwhile, the charity which has been working for almost three decades to bridge the gap between starting integrated schools and securing full government support has welcomed Ulster University proposals for a concerted effort in Northern Ireland to eradicate sectarianism.The university, supported by the Sir George Quigley Fund, launched lsquoSectarianism in Northern Ireland: a Reviewrsquo at a conference at the UUrsquos Belfast campus last week.The Integrated Education Fundmdash which was established in  mdash praised the conference for addressing the issue and welcomed Patrick Kieltyrsquos comments that educating all children together is the way forward for a shared future.The review contains more than  proposals for how bodies including government, business, education, youth services, arts and sport could work collectively over a sustained period of time to foster greater collaboration and understanding across communities.As well suggesting that a government department should be established specically to tackle sectarianism, the researchers propose establishing a new civic body to help shape community efforts toward reconciliation.IEF chief executive Tina Merron said the organisation ldquoshares the vision, held by the overwhelming majority of citizens, of a united community and a shared future.Ms Merron said that at the signing of the Good Friday Agreement there were , pupils in  integrated schools, compared with more than , attending  integrated schools today.She said that with no government plan for integrated education, the growth was down to ldquodetermined campaigners and pioneering parents.She added: ldquoWe see a reformed education system as an essential ingredient of this future an education system which brings children, staff and governors from Catholic and Protestant traditions, as well as those of other faiths or none and of other cultures, together in schools, an education system which recognises and respects ersity and ensures that all young people feel confident and welcome in their school environment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein’s Casey chosen as district’s first citizen  ","story":"SINN Feinrsquos Charlie Casey is Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos new chairman.The Newry politicianrsquos appointment was confirmed at the local authorityrsquos annual meeting on Monday night when he succeeded the SDLPrsquos Mark Murnin as the districtrsquos first citizen.The new council vice-chairman is Rowallane SDLP councillor Terry Andrews, who succeeded Sinn Feinrsquos Oksana McMahon, who represented the Crotlieve area but lost her seat in the recent local government election.The new chairman was presented with his chain of office by his predecessor, who also losthis Slieve Croob seat at the recent election.The new first citizen said he was delighted to be nominated for the position by his party and hoped to do the position justice, urging all councillors to unite to protect services under the threat in the council area, particularly those in relation to the health and welfare of all, in particular, the most vulnerable.Cllr Casey also took time to thank Mr Murnin and Mrs McMahon for their work over the past year and the other councillors who were not ing to the council following the election.Addressing members as chairman for the first time, Cllr Casey urged them to fight for lesaving and le-changing services, champion the cause of equality and take forward the councilrsquos commitment of putting the organisation at the heart of everything it does.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos mission is to lead and serve the district as a prosperous and healthy area and ensure it is sustainable from an economic, environmental and social perspective.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

There is a piece of disused waste groundwe have had it signed over to us. Tullygally PS pupils in a game of Tug of War at Lurgans Centrepoint“Pat will come over and he will introduce his Train B Smart and we can work out of his Hub.“Early intervention is key to get those children knowing the mental and physical well-being is the way forward. That will also have a bigger influence then on the parents and the wider community.”Ms Andrews is mindful that the school pitch is currently unused because of the anti-social behaviour. She is keen that this project moves forward for the sake of the children and the community.“But without the funding, we can’t move forward. The EA has already signed over the pitch and council are working hard to give us the waste ground behind it but without a working Assembly, I am afraid this will be a missed opportunity.Tullygally PS pupils in a game of Tug of War at Lurgans Centrepoint“We need £, to make this project work and start building the Train B Smart Hub at Tullygally Primary School,” she said.But the Hub won’t be just for Tullygally PS, as Pat explains: “The whole idea with Train B Smart is for the local and wider community to be able to participate in multi-sports. That’s the key aim. We know not everybody is going to be an elite athlete, that’s not the point. The point is that everybody can get enjoyment out of it. This is why the children are here. We want them to enjoy sport.”And Pat has the backing of some big names from his former manager Alex Ferguson and team mates Roy Keane and Roy Carroll.Police probe arson attack and suspected gas leak in Craigavon Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Former Manchester United goalkeeper and Wigan Athletic player, Roy Carroll popped into Centrepoint in Lurgan on Thursday to help train some of the pupils.And he was very impressed, spotting potential stars of the future.Former Northern Ireland player Roy is fully behind Pat’s bid for a Train B Smart Hub in Craigavon.He said: “Pat and I used to play football together at Wigan Athletic. I came home about three years ago and Pat asked me to come up and help out and it is always a pleasure to come and work with him again.“I just came here today to give the kids a bit of training. It is great what they are doing.“Sports takes a lot of pressure of kids and that’s what its all about.

","story":"Normally Libby Magill is hard at work in The Asburn Hotel#s kitchen washing dishes but last Friday she was the star on ITV quiz show The Chase.The -year-old catering assistant, though clearly nervous, out-shone her three fellow contestants and scooped £k for the team.Single-mum Libby appeared on the popular show last Friday - a secret she had kept from her colleagues at The Asburn Hotel.“I was shaking like a leaf on the show,” she said.But Libby held her own against The Chaser - Jenny ‘The Vixen’ Ryan - even though the contestant who went before her was ousted. And she scooped a fantastic £, for the pot.Libby, who has had her eye on taking part in The Chase for many years, described the show’s host, comedian Bradley Walsh as ‘so charming and funny’.Even though he nearly got her into hot water with The Ashburn’s chef Micky McLaughlin.Laughing she said Bradley had asked her on the showMicky was like Gordon Ramsay.“There was a lot said about Micky on the show but some of it was cut out,” she revealed.The show was filmed last October and Libby said it was hard to keep it from her workmates.Her daughter Chloe, who works part time as floor staff in the restaurant, knew about it but was sworn to secrecy.“I thought I had to pre-warn chef Micky as he was mentioned on the show but didn’t tell him how I got on,” said the Kilwilkie woman.A former pupil at Tannaghmore PS and St Mary’s Junior High School, Libby puts down her ability for quizzes to her avid book reading.The Royal visit to Northern Ireland continued as the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall visited Brownlow House, Lurgan Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"She watches quiz shows regularly and takes part in a lot of radio quizzes.She told Bradley Walsh thatshe won the money she would renovate a spare room into a library for all her books and as a craft room for her crochet hobby.Asked why she had applied for the show, she said: “It was on my bucket list. I always wanted to go on a quiz show. Then I hit  and hadn’t done it and then I did  and I was determined to do it.“I applied and went for an audition in Belfast and got on the show,” she said.And she isn’t stopping there with plans afoot to hopefully take part in The Tipping Point.She has plenty more things on her bucket list to achieve including a bungee jump and sky ing, plus a trip to Australia to see her three nieces.Though he didn’t appear on The Chase, Lurgan chef Micky McLaughlin is now known by the millions who watch the show.The -year-old chef said: “We are all very proud of her. The rest of the team did nothing. She was the one who got the £, cashbuilder.”Paul McConaghy, owner of The Ashburn Hotel, said everyone was ‘very proud of her’.“She was unreal.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sto1.jpg","title":"ni business rates to undergo full review","story":"Posted on Thursday May  by John Mulgrew There will be a full review of Northern Ireland’s business rates system, a top civil servant has revealed. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/graham_11.jpg","title":"word from the wise graham lapsley","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Graham Lapsley, head of private banking, Danske Bank How did you start out in business   Banking has always been in my blood as my father joined Belfast Banking Co Ltdin . As a boy I remember being in Northern Bank branches ‘helping out’ when my father was completing regular evenings doing overtime. This was an environment that I was familiar with, although I didn’t ever think I would make banking a career. In  I found myself in Limavady branch and thoroughly enjoyed branch banking at a time when there were no computers, no autobanks and lots of staff. I’ve benefited from lots of dferent roles at the Bank in my career, each bringing its own challenges. I left my role as head of personal credit last year to take up my current position as head of private banking. What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far On a personal level changing job roles always brought new challenges. Change is a constant which I accept and while I’ve worked in Danske Bank for  years I have had senior roles in branch banking, wealth management, business banking, risk management and now private banking.   As an area manager in branch banking, I found the leadership of the transition from Australian ownership to Danish ownership in  a huge challenge. This change was as exciting as it was challenging as we benefited from huge investment and the Dane’s leading edge technology. I didn’t go directly from school to university, but I’ve been lucky enough to have had employer support to complete a business studies degree and a masters’ degree in executive leadership. I’ve also attended business schools in Boston, Lausanne and London, with each giving me new tools to add into my skill set.  How would you describe your management style  I am energetic and enthusiastic. I love working with our relationship managers and customers to build a financial solution. I am very results oriented and prefer a direct style. I am very self-awareand have a positive outlook.  What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I’m not sure that I would change anything. I’ve learnt from my mistakes and that made me a better banker in the long term. Perhaps my ambition in my early career took me into roles that didn’t match my skill sets, but I did take away vital learnings from these experiences  Have you done it all on your own  Absolutely not. My we Sonya and family have always been a great support and this enabled me to have a good work le balance. I have a strong network personally and professionally, which is mutually supportive. I’ve also been lucky enough to have worked with many leaders who have greatly inspired me.  What’s more important, your product or your people  In Private Banking, without a doubt our people. We are a people business and our strength in Private Banking rests with the professionalism of the private banking team. We offer premium relationship management to our private banking customers, supported by leading edge digital solutions. Our customers value our expertise and the ability to meet up in person to discuss financial plans.  What makes your business stand out from the competition  There are numerous competitors in the marketplace, but we are the biggest private banking relationship management team in Northern Ireland. Danske is also the leading corporate and business bank in Northern Ireland, and many of these customers have their personal needs looked after by my private banking team.  What piece of advice would you give to a  year old you  You’ll never be judged on what happens to you, but you will be judged on how you react to it. And you won’t get the experience you need, until the day after you needed it.

I’ve heard employers bemoan the fact that this generation can’t communicate face-to-face or they place more emphasis on their passions outside of work than their own career development.While some of this is no doubt grounded in their experience, employers perhaps need to adjust how they engage with the new generation beyond just offering them quirky perks and trendy working environments. Hays recently sponsored The GoodIdea, the biggest ever AI hackathon in NI organised by AINIand Hackily – a two-day event hosted by QUB School of Computing and Ulster University Magee campus for around  hackers in Belfast and  in Derry.The hackathon provided a welcoming and collaborative environment for hackers to build out brilliant, innovative, and impactful ideas using AI under a theme of ‘AI for good’, where hackers were challenged to utilise open data sources to create an innovative solution to a real-world problem.It was an opportunity for students – who made up % of the attendees – and experienced professionals to meet fellow hackers, learn new technologies, and work alongside seasoned mentors.Far from being underwhelmed by Generation Z, we were inspired by the talent pools from dferent backgrounds such as computer science, physics and maths, coming together to collaborate with each other, learn about bleeding edge technologies and also to put their skills to use in creating something that was a benefit to society. For example, one of the teams invented an algorithm for a computer to read British sign language using a webcam.These were ambitious, driven, competitive young people who worked brilliantly in their teams and certainly didn’t struggle to communicate, eventhey arrived alone and joined a team. A team from Glasgow made the journey across to take part and the hackathon ran right through Saturday night – so we couldn’t fault their work ethic.There were prizes, mentorship and funding available to the winners of the hackathon, as well as recruitment advice and workshops provided to students and professionals by Hays’ own experts across software development, data engineering and cyber security.But the main attraction was undoubtedly in the opportunity to co-create new ideas about how to apply technology to the world they will run in future. That is hugely positive and our challenge as employers must be to make sure the students who will be the candidates of the future in NI’s thriving tech community are encouraged to put that passion into their careers.The undergraduate community is an under-served community of future leaders in terms of recruitment and our desire is to equip undergraduates with the right understanding of what employers in the tech sector want and how they can build their personal brand for the future.Employers need to get past the myths about Generation Z and focus on helping younger employees find meaning in their workthey are to unlock their potential.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/5g1.jpg","title":"belfast to get superfast g mobile broadband this month","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by John Mulgrew Suzanne Wylie, Belfast City Council with Karen Dundas, EE Victoria Square store manager Belfast is to become one of six UK cities to get superfast G mobile broadband later this month, it has emerged. EE is bringing the connectivity to the city from May , alongside London, Edinburgh, Cardf, Birmingham and Manchester. While still at an early phase, with further roll-out a longer term project, EE says it expects customers in Belfast to “experience an increase in speeds of around -Mbps even in the busiest areas”. “Some customers will break the one gigabit-per-second milestone on their G smartphones.
