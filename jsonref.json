He also said he was prepared to sell a £1.6million work by modernist painter Marc Chagall.But High Court judge Clive Jones threw out Stunt’s application for proceedings to be adjourned and declared him bankrupt.Stunt’s barrister Timothy Higginson said criticism of his client amounted to ‘personal attacks’ and blamed his failure to comply with a previous court ruling on the restraint order.

Later, the women and children were forced on trains to be taken to Auschwitz.Her family arrived together. But her two younger sisters, Rivka, ten, and eight-year-old Etta, and her toddler brother Ben-Zvi were too young to work so they were taken to the gas chamber immediately, along with their mother Shlima.Only Rachel and her brother Chaskiel, 16, were spared. She underwent other ‘selections’ – often overseen by Dr Josef Mengele – in which the weakest were picked out to die, as part of the extermination of around six million Jews.         Rachel Levy (back row, third from left), aged 13, with family members including her mother, a brother, two sisters and an aunt, who all diedFinally, he gestured that she too should die. But a delay forced their SS guard to listen to their cries, as they called out: ‘Why can’t you help us?’ Mrs Levy said the female guard gestured for them to run away and she hid among kitchen workers. She and thousands of other inmates were later forced to walk for 21 days from Poland to the concentration camp Bergen-Belsen in Germany in the last months of the war – the so-called ‘Death March’.Once inside Belsen, she was met by unimaginable scenes of horror, as piles of bodies were left to rot. Her aunt died in the camp and Mrs Levy contracted typhoid.Liberation came in April 1945, when British soldiers arrived. Mrs Levy and her brother Chaskiel were reunited and came to Britain.Daughter Shelley, 56, said her mother still suffered nightmares after reliving her experiences but was delighted to learn she would be honoured for her work.BEMs were also awarded to Walter Kammerling, 95, Gabrielle Keenaghan, 92, Ernest Simon, 89, George Hans Vulkan, 89, and Ann and Bob Kirk, 90 and 94, who were all brought to Britain as children to escape Nazi-occupied Europe. Mr Kirk lost 20 members of his family but survived after his parents sent him to Britain from Germany in 1939, when he was 13. His wife Ann said: ‘In our talks, we always make the point that our experiences show the dangers of racial prejudice and that it is essential to treat everybody as human beings, regardless of race and religion.’The Holocaust Educational Trust estimates that those honoured have given powerful accounts to more than 100,000 schoolchildren.Karen Pollock, the trust’s chief executive, said: ‘Against a backdrop of rising anti-Semitism, Holocaust denial and hate, we must ensure that this period of history is taught about and known and that the memory of the past is preserved and shared so that future generations know what happened.’"},{"url":null,"title":"New noise cameras used Britains roads catch boy racers revving engines","story":"Share this article Officials are also expected to draw up guidelines for what amounts to too much noise, and formalise the level of fines.

Small change, however, for a man who in 2001 invested £25 million in a small loss-making Chinese messaging service called Tencent. That stake is now worth more than £100 billion.         The Grade II-listed house’s Palladian façade of golden limestone was reckoned to be one of the prettiest in the country         Bekker’s concept is to make the estate as self-sustaining as possible — or, as one of his staff told me this week: ‘We want to give everyone the “full banquet”: to provide everything they need.’The ethos is to celebrate all things Somerset with gusto. The meats and cheeses come from neighbouring farms. So, too, the locally-quarried Blue Lias stone used in the garden.At the moment the beef sold in the farm shop comes from a handful of local suppliers. In time, the estate will rear its own cattle.Alongside the butcher is the cheese counter, where the same concept has been given an added twist. In order to provide home-grown mozzarella, The Newt has located a nearby herd of buffalo.Craftsmen are still at work on the main house, which is being turned into a hotel with 23 bedrooms, a spa, gym, bar and restaurants. It will open for business at the end of August.Much of the grounds, however, along with café, cider press and shop, have been opened. Locals have been invited to test everything from the quality of the food to the crisp dry ‘cyder’ being made in state-of-the-art cellars.The gardens, however, take centre stage and this week I was given a sneak preview. It is a mind-blowing experience — every sensation is tested: sight, taste, hearing, touch and smell.         Judging by the comments from fellow visitors, this remarkable attraction may soon rank alongside great British gardens such as Sissinghurst in Kent, Great Dixter near Rye, East Sussex, and Tresco Abbey in the Isles of Scilly         Craftsmen are still at work on the main house, which is being turned into a hotel with 23 bedrooms, a spa, gym, bar and restaurants. It will open for business at the end of AugustJudging by the comments from fellow visitors, this remarkable attraction may soon rank alongside great British gardens such as Sissinghurst in Kent, Great Dixter near Rye, East Sussex, and Tresco Abbey in the Isles of Scilly.Most likely its key rival will be the Lost Gardens of Heligan in Cornwall, restored in the Nineties after decades of neglect. Indeed, the Newt’s director of horticulture Iain Davies, who oversees 18 garden and woodland experts, was previously at Heligan.Unlike Heligan, however, the gardens here had not been abandoned for years. Horticultural writer enelope Hobhouse, who created the Queen Mother’s garden at Walmer Castle in Kent, established the centrepiece, a parabola-shaped walled garden, in the Sixties. But she left after her marriage to Sir Arthur’s son Paul broke down.Just as she had been inspired by the beauty of the winemaking region in her native South Africa, Karen Roos fell in love with the countryside of Somerset. The egg-shaped Parabola has been restored with discreet terracing and an extraordinary collection of trained apple trees, arranged in a maze.All the apple-growing counties of England are represented — so, too, are Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Some of the saplings are arranged into elaborate designs, one remarkably representing the double helix of DNA. They’re a masterclass in showing how, with the right expertise, you can train a fruit tree into any shape.A clue to the thinking behind this celebration lies in a Latin motto inscribed into the stone paving: ‘from the egg to the apple’ or from start to finish.         A hazelwood fence announces our arrival at the colour garden. This is a homage to the last horticulturalists to till the soil here, Canadians Nori and Sandra Pope, who spent 20 years restoring the gardens with swathes of colourful blooms         Yet for all its modern twists and new-build look, the estate still has the air of a lost paradise. In part it is because of the bucolic setting and also, perhaps, the clutch of chickens looking on hungrily as I sample a slice of freshly made cake — apple, naturallyThe phrase inspired the Bekkers and their team to create an historical timeline for the estate, with a garden shaped by ideas and traditions from past to present.‘The idea is to transport visitors,’ says my guide, garden director Arthur Cole. ‘There are so many things to look out for.’Entry to the estate is down an elegant, twisting boardwalk, from where you alight in the threshing barn, which looks hundreds of years old but is brand new.But then that is the conceit of the place. Just outside the café is an area shaded by 20 semi-mature London plane trees. Each was brought in by lorry nearly fully grown. Elsewhere, an entire yew hedge was shipped from Belgium.Step through the courtyard and there is a farm shop to the left and a shining steel cider press to the right, a contraption that would not look out of place in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Yet for all its modern twists and new-build look, the estate still has the air of a lost paradise. In part it is because of the bucolic setting and also, perhaps, the clutch of chickens looking on hungrily as I sample a slice of freshly made cake — apple, naturally.Leaving the Parabola you pass through beds of fragrant herbs. The path meanders through campions, wild pea, yarrow and cowslip. The Prince of Wales, who has done so much to champion gardens, would love it.‘The wildflowers provide food for our bees,’ says Arthur.Food for the guests, meanwhile, comes from the kitchen garden where there are rows of Iberian garlic and beds of asparagus. Arthur plucks a petal of a California poppy. ‘Try this, it’s edible,’ he says. Everything that’s grown is on the menu in the garden cafe.The watchword is ‘no-dig gardening’, to prevent the break-up of nitrates in the soil which happens when forks are plunged into the earth. Only gentle aerating of the ground is permitted.A hazelwood fence announces our arrival at the colour garden. This is a homage to the last horticulturalists to till the soil here, Canadians Nori and Sandra Pope, who spent 20 years restoring the gardens with swathes of colourful blooms.We enter via the red garden, where native poppies are broken up with bold strokes of purple provided by lobelias.Next stop is the water-edged Victorian Fragrance Garden — marked by a Queen Victoria penny coin set into the ground — where violets and roses jostle with rows of box.And here is the reason for the estate’s name. Sculptures of two giant newts are pushing their way through a brick end-wall.The estate is home to a colony of 2,000 newts — all three UK species: great crested, palmate and smooth. Many of the water features have strips of timber to provide ladders for the newts, whose presence as protected species resulted in delays to the project.Another coin heralds the next stop. It is a pre-World War I George V penny, and it marks a cottage garden inspired by the designer Gertrude Jekyll.The Newt is a sumptuous illustration of sensitivity in design. In the Parabola, unlike many a garden, there are no steps, so it can be reached in a wheelchair.Soon there will be educational tours and a garden museum is planned. There will also be one other unique feature: a dedicated Great Western Railway carriage for visitors travelling from London Paddington by train.One visit scarcely does it justice — I had no time for the woodland walks, nor to visit the marl pit created by digging out lime-rich deposits. It has left an island which the garden folk say evokes Avalon, the site of Camelot where King Arthur died, said to be somewhere in Somerset.It is an extraordinary hybrid: think the Daylesford farm shop crossed with a National Trust museum, with a slice of the Royal Horticultural Gardens at Wisley thrown in for good measure.What is perhaps even more remarkable is that, for all the attention to detail, the owners have bought the place not for themselves, but for the public. Some days the Bekkers can be seen pottering around the gardens in raincoat and straw hat just like their paying visitors."},{"url":null,"title":"James Stunts Rolls Royce parked pavement outside nightclub","story":"Share this article Speaking in Brazil, the F1 guru said he had ‘no idea’ if Stunt had any business sense or how he was getting by financially. He said he was ‘probably living a pitiful life’ due to restrictions on his spending imposed by police. Admitting he himself was probably owned ‘millions’, Mr Ecclestone added: ‘The bottom line is, anything I did in the past was to help him, for the good of Petra, the good of his wife, and I knew exactly what the result was going to be.He said: ‘In my opinion, when he was first with Petra I thought he was a nice guy. Nothing wrong with him at all, good company, good guy. Trying to do the best he was doing.‘And that’s the only reason I gave any help. To try to help him get on. I just think there’s something a little bit wrong with him, that’s all. I don’t think it’s his nature.’Stunt’s lawyer told the High Court his client was ‘very, very’ rich but did not have access to his money. A court has frozen Stunt’s assets – including his homes and beloved supercars – under a ‘proceeds of crime’ restraint order.Yesterday the brash Surrey-born bullion dealer, who enjoyed a private education, complained: ‘I have to be the richest man that has ever just been made bankrupt – all because of this restraint nonsense. I can’t let my ego get in the way right now, because I’m going to win this silly bankruptcy.’He urged his online followers not to believe the Daily Mail’s court reporting, saying: ‘They’re going to write bankrupt, bankrupt, bankrupt – it doesn’t mean I’ve lost anything. I offered a million more, but the assets were restrained.’ He added: ‘I’m not worried, I’m not nervous at all.’Stunt, 37, had bragged he would never go bankrupt, but his excuses ran out on Thursday after a string of court hearings. He faced a towering debt pile worth £14million of allegedly unpaid bills. He owed a £1million gambling debt to a spreadbetting firm, and another £3.9million to Christie’s auction house for a Picasso. He was even being chased by his own orce lawyers, who helped negotiate his 2017 split from Miss Ecclestone, 30, for a debt of £247,000.The father of three convinced a series of judges he was on the brink of being able to settle his debts – although he disputed several of the claims – by selling off artworks including a £2.1million Monet. He also said he was prepared to sell a £1.6million work by modernist painter Marc Chagall.But High Court judge Clive Jones threw out Stunt’s application for proceedings to be adjourned and declared him bankrupt.Stunt’s barrister Timothy Higginson said criticism of his client amounted to ‘personal attacks’ and blamed his failure to comply with a previous court ruling on the restraint order. The assets will ultimately remain under the control of the CPS and the courts until the investigation is over. "},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Louis makes Buckingham Palace balcony debut","story":"Be a ray of sunshine like the Duchess of Cambridge in Alexander McQueenShop the brandTrooping the Colour is one of the most significant events in the royal calendar.

As you head further into the house, an intricate archway guards the entrance to the living room, which in-keeping with the opulent and regal theme is dressed with silver, glass and diamond fittings and framed by thick, heavy blue crushed velvet curtains which Denise made herself.Denise has designed almost every feature in the house - from the banisters to the mirrored staircase and she\u0027s even made all of her own curtains and upholstered the furniture.She\u0027s up-cycled and painted almost everything - from the walls, to the fireplaces, lampshades, panelling and even the white photo frame that hangs around the TV.

The master bedroom then comes complete with a gold, regal-style canopy above the bed which was designed and created by Denise and Michael from pieces of plywood.Finished off with some gold curtains and hanging diamonds, it frames the white, vintage-style bed which is completely covered in cushions and decorative items.But, perhaps the most unique feature of the entire property is the Da Vinci-style mural which has been painted onto the ceiling of the master bedroom.

It comprises 26 snapshots pasted on pages torn out of a school exercise book and placed inside stapled-together plain covers that are now stained and discoloured with age. For all sorts of reasons, it is a good place to start.There is no artifice in the actual photographs. They trace ordinary moments in Sherman’s early life from infancy to adolescence: cute baby pics, family gatherings, snaps of her as a child at the beach and portraits of her as a teenager standing gauchely alongside awkward young men. What is striking is the sense of an almost stereotypical all-American suburban childhood. As is always the case with Sherman, though, nothing is quite what it seems.In green ink, she has circled herself in each photo and underneath written “That’s me,”. That comma is fascinating, perhaps a child’s grammatical error, yet already implying, as curator Paul Moorhouse notes in his catalogue essay, “an unfolding process”. When Sherman rediscovered Cindy Book as a 21-year-old art student, the process unfolded some more, as she added extra photos to the album and, as she puts it, made “the handwriting seem to grow up along with the images”. Does she consider the original handmade album the beginning of her long and singular art practice (“That’s me, or is it?”) or does it start in earnest with the later intervention?“The original book is interesting to me because it was more about my fascination with our family snapshots,” she says. “They were kept in a shoebox and, as a child, I loved to pore over them looking for pictures of myself as a baby, but also to identify all these characters that existed before I was born. There was such a big age gap between my older siblings and myself, so I think now I was somehow finding myself in the family through the snapshots. When I came back to the album as a student, that was definitely the more knowing artist coming into play.”Somewhere between those two creative impulses, one instinctive and psychologically revealing, the other conceptual and wilfully deceptive, may lie the enduring fascination of Sherman’s art. For nigh on 50 years, on the strength of one enduringly brilliant idea – turning the camera on her transformed self in order to exaggerate and illuminate the archetypes that are all around us, so familiar as to go almost unnoticed – Sherman has been hiding in plain sight as one of the great artists of our time. In that time, she has redefined photographic portraiture, her approach being, as her friend the writer and editor Ingrid Sischy noted in 1991, more akin to that of a cinematic auteur. “She’s the director, the producer, the set designer, the costume mistress, and the star as well... In her hands, images aren’t straitjackets but vehicles to show the infinite possibilities of who she could be.”As the NPG retrospective will show, hers is an art of shape-shifting and disguise, artifice and camouflage. It draws on high and low culture: European and Hollywood films, 1950s television sitcoms, art history, high society, fashion, forensic science, drag, pinups and pornography the esoteric and the everyday, the glamorous and the grotesque. All her major series are here, from the still resonant Untitled Film Stills, which she began when she first moved to New York in the late 70s, through the controversial Centerfolds, the even more controversial Sex Pictures (surely the most grotesquely provocative images ever exhibited in the gallery), the acerbic Fashion pictures, the History Portraits, the Flappers and the Street Style Stars.Seeing her creative journey unfold, from her use of cheap wigs and secondhand clothes through her discovery of prosthetics and on to her current Instagram experiments in digital face manipulation, what really fascinates is the consistent cultural resonance of her work. “Sherman’s target is the look of the modern world,” notes Moorhouse, “with whose manufactured character she evidently has a love–hate relationship.” And, if her personas have often echoed the way in which our image-obsessed culture has elevated style and appearance, they have also of late become freighted with new meaning in the so-called post-truth age, as the idea of the blatantly fake has taken on more ominous meaning, becoming an acceptable part of our degraded political discourse.As an interviewee, Sherman is incredibly accommodating, but somehow elusive, upbeat but slightly detached. A friend once memorably described her as having “the banality of a great actress”, which may be a clever way of keeping the world at bay, but one can see why she connected with the art-rocker David Byrne – they were an item for several years – who evinces a similar kind of not quite normal normalness.Before that, she was married for 15 years to video artist Michel Auder, who was addicted to heroin for most of the relationship. They split up in 1999. She described a subsequent short relationship with struggling film-maker Paul H-O as “real fucked-up”. She is currently contentedly single, sharing her Manhattan loft apartment and her house in the Hamptons with a macaw called Mister Frieda, which she has owned for nearly 28 years. “He’s been the longest companion I’ve ever had,” she said recently, “although it’s like having a perpetual two-year-old.”Sherman came of age when postmodern theory occupied a place in art discourse that it no longer does perhaps this is why her work has endured much better than some of her peers: because of its implicit – and sometimes explicit – feminist politics. “I’m not personally articulate,” she says when I mention this. “I don’t even like giving lectures, and I certainly couldn’t debate with anyone, but I have strong personal stances. I couldn’t be an advocate but, through my work, I can be outspoken. What’s also important, though, is that the work is always ambiguous, that it lends itself to interpretation. I’m not a message artist.”That much was clear from the start. Likewise the love-hate relationship with her subject matter that Moorhouse identifies. Both, as with her fascination with dressing up, may have their roots in her childhood. Born in New Jersey in 1954 and raised in Long Island, she grew up in thrall to Hollywood B-movies and television sitcoms of the time, many of which portrayed suburban America as an idyll of domesticity, traditional family values and untrammelled aspiration.“I remember, as a child, being drawn to shows like I Love Lucy,” she recalls, “but, even then, realising the artifice in them, the goofy sentiment of all those perfect mums with the perfect homes and perfect men. Growing up in the actual suburbs made me look at what was being portrayed and realise that it was fake. So I was both attracted and repulsed by those films and shows. I think that paradox somehow found its way into the work.”The young Cynthia Sherman’s family dynamic was complex. Her father, an aircraft engineer, was 49 and her mother, a high-school teacher, 45 when she was born. She was the youngest of five children, all of whom were much older – 19 years separated Cynthia from her eldest sibling. She first began dressing up as a young child, often in the sanctuary of her bedroom. Was it, I ask, a form of attention-seeking, maybe even a cry for help? “It’s something I’ve talked about in therapy in recent years,” she says, matter of factly. “I know that I wasn’t dressing up to entertain my family. It was more about me thinking, maybe they’ll like me better this way. I guess I felt I wasn’t accepted somehow. My parents had thought they were done with raising children when I came along. I don’t think I picked up on all that until I began talking about it to my therapist.”In past interviews, Sherman has described her childhood as normal and happy, which is certainly the sense you get from the Cindy Book. However, in one interview, she described her father as “a creep” who “would criticise with hate” and, in another, called him “a bigot” and “racist”. As an adolescent, she experienced family tragedy up close, when her brother Frank took his own life. He had moved back into the family home in his mid-20s and belatedly bonded with his younger sister, who was 15 and had just made the decision to apply to art school when it happened. His death inevitably casts a long shadow. In 2016, when the Observer’s Tim Adams broached the subject, she burst into tears and spoke of her subsequent time at art college as a kind of therapy.In 1972, she began studying for an art degree at Buffalo State College, where she initially excelled at drawing and painting but, ironically, failing the compulsory photography course because of her lack of technical skills. When forced to repeat it, she came under the tutelage of Barbara Jo Revelle, the first person to make her aware of conceptualism. “She felt that to have an idea was what mattered,” Sherman told the New Yorker in 2000, “and right away that made so much more sense to me”. At Buffalo State College, Sherman began going out with an older artist, Robert Longo, and it was in their shared apartment that she made the first picture of herself – “stark naked, like a deer in the headlights” – as a way to confront her own suburban prudishness. In 1974, while working as an assistant in the nonprofit gallery Hallwalls she set up with Longo and others, she began turning up to openings disguised as someone else in thrift-shop clothes and makeup, standing quietly and without explanation amid the art works.The pair moved to New York soon afterwards, living in a loft in Fulton Street in lower Manhattan in the shadow of the newly built World Trade Center, when rents were cheap and the now-gentrified neighbourhood was a ghost town after dark. “I never felt scared walking home at 4am,” she says. “There was no one to rob, so there were no criminals.”At first, she stayed in a lot, dressing up and taking pictures of herself. For a time, she worked as a receptionist in a downtown gallery, Artists Space, again sometimes turning up in disguise – once in a nurse’s outfit, another time as a 1950s secretary. One day, she showed a small selection of her photographs to the gallery director, Helene Winer, who told her she was on to something. It was the beginning of what would become her breakthrough series, Untitled Film Stills, in which she posed as archetypal characters from American B-movies and European art house films: the femme fatale, the bored housewife, the city girl, the vamp.Despite their postmodern knowingness, those early images still fascinate. The generic female characters she inhabits – furtive film actresses, harassed looking housewives, prim librarians – are ambiguous creations, identifiable as archetypes of femininity but also marooned from their contexts, freeze-framed in some bigger, more mysterious narrative. They are photography as elaborate performance: cerebral, ironic, deadpan. As in all of the series that follow, Sherman is present in the images as photographer, art director and performer, but absent insofar as they tell us nothing about her in the way a traditional self-portrait might. Instead, they are pure persona.“My early work was more about creating still lifes in a way,” she says. “Over time, it’s become more about portraiture, but it’s never been about self-portraiture because I don’t feel like it is revealing anything of myself. It’s about obscuring my identity, erasing or obliterating myself. It’s not fantasy or pretending or narcissism. It’s not about me.”Alongside Jeff Wall, whose elaborately staged scenarios echoed traditional documentary photography while simultaneously subverting its style and its supposed truthfulness, Sherman made photography into a conceptual art form by foregrounding its deceptiveness (“I know the camera always lies,” she once said). Though not much commented upon, there is an element of play, as well as playacting, in all she does. “Oh yes. It’s fun,” she says, cheerily. “It’s literally playing in my studio. That’s why I like to work alone, because I can be less inhibited. I often don’t know what I want until the end. It’s very liberating.”Can she remember the initial thrill of finding her own style, her language? “Initially, it was just me retreating into my room and playing with makeup for fun. It was Longo who told me I should document my transformation from my normal self, which was masculine and boyish, to this vamp. When I did that, people were immediately interested. That’s when I could really say: this is my art.”The transformation was not altogether straightforward, though, as she elaborates. “I thought I had found my place as an artist, but the problem was that, back then, photography was not a medium that was condoned by the art world. I felt I really wasn’t accepted in the art or the photography world because I wasn’t either.”When did that change? “Not until the early 90s.” Really? That late? “Oh yes,” she says, still sounding slightly indignant. “I remember, back in the early 80s, I was included in a group show at MoMA and certain collectors saying, ‘I love your work, but I don’t collect photography.’” She pauses and, then, laughing, adds: “In fact, someone said that to me just a few weeks ago in Venice during the Biennale. It still happens, but rarely.”These days, though, it no longer rankles. In 2011, Sherman made headlines when one of her Centrefolds series, Untitled #96, sold at auction for $3.89m, making it the most expensive photograph ever at that time. (It has since been superseded by Andreas Gursky’s Rhein II and Richard Prince’s Spiritual America, but five of her other works feature in the top 20 most expensive photographs of all time.) “I didn’t start to feel super-successful,” she says, “until I did the paintings show.” (She’s referring to the History Portraits, which she completed in 1990, using prosthetics as well as wigs, makeup and period costumes, to recreate the style of old master artworks.)“I think they sold,” she adds, pointedly, “because they looked like old paintings.” That must have been satisfying, though. “In a way, yes, but their popularity made me feel very guilty. I went straight into the Sex Pictures afterwards.”The Sex Pictures (1992), alongside an earlier series that has come to be known as her Disaster pictures (1986-89), represent two viscerally angry, but nevertheless complex, responses to her own success in an art market not immune to peddling bad art in the guise of provocation. The latter series is both intentionally tasteless and compositionally intriguing: rotten food, vomit and fake body parts all photographed up-close and large-scale so that, from a distance, they look like abstractions. Intriguingly, she was mostly absent from the meticulously constructed ugliness, appearing as a ghostly reflection, as if aghast at the horror of it all.For the Sex Pictures, she used prosthetic penises, vaginas, sex toys and distorted limbs ordered from a catalogue of medical dummies used in teaching. “I had already been collecting fake tits and asses for years,” she says breezily, “because I thought that at some point I could do really explicit nudity, but not of myself.”The work features all the motifs of hardcore pornography but rendered grotesquely unreal and all the more unsettling for that. It was in part a response to the culture wars of the late 1980s, when the National Endowment for the Arts came under intense pressure from the Christian right for funding “inappropriate” work by the likes of Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano. It was also a riposte to Jeff Koons’s Made in Heaven series, which comprised pornographic photographs of the artist and his bride to be, porn star Ilona ‘Cicciolina” Staller. “I found them so lame and tame and not shocking at all,” she says. “They just made me kind of angry.”The Sex Pictures leap out of the catalogue for the NPG show, their visceral power to shock and disturb undiminished by the years. Their elaborate unrealness somehow makes them more shocking than Koons’s empty porn pastiche or even the most hardcore photograph by Mapplethorpe. I can’t imagine they were fun to make, though. “I guess in a different way, they were, because I also enjoy doing the really difficult things that people can’t buy. It’s a reaction against the commerce of the art world, because I do feel guilty about it.”Her work has calmed down since, as has, post-therapy, her life. She remains something of an enigma in the art world, both a product of it and a somewhat reluctant star within it. Her extraordinary success, though somewhat belated, seems to have taken her by surprise and, one senses, precipitated a long period of adjustment. “It all happened to me much faster than it did for a lot of my friends, who weren’t as successful,” she says. “That was difficult for me, but it has passed. I have accepted it more now.”Nevertheless, her status still rankles even some of those supposedly closest to her. “There are a couple of friends I only see once a year when I have a Christmas party,” she says, “Otherwise, I don’t have anything to do with them because I can feel their resentment so strongly. Even one of my family members is that way.”She is not, she says, much given to “schmoozing at big, groovy openings”, but is certainly a presence on social media, where her Instagram feed, featuring regular posts of her face bent out of shape via digital manipulation, has 255,000 followers. It is, she says, more about “goofing around a lot” than an extension of her art practice. “Someone showed me an app which people use to make themselves look better online,” she says. “I use it to make myself really not look better.”If one wanted to measure how deeply Cindy Sherman’s art of disguise has seeped into the public consciousness, you need look no further than an episode of the popular podcast This American Life. In 2012, when MoMA in New York hosted a retrospective of her work, Ira Glass, the podcast host, recalled an encounter in which a woman – upper middle class, aged 55-60, wearing wire-rimmed spectacles – had approached him and his friend in the gallery claiming to be Cindy Sherman. She told them that she came to the exhibition every day in disguise to see how people reacted to the work.When they quizzed her, studying her face for clues, she became uncomfortable, ending the conversation abruptly by saying that she was not in fact Cindy Sherman. They, of course, interpreted this as a typically Cindy Sherman thing to do. “It made her very credibly Cindy Sherman,” Glass concluded. “But, eEven if it was not her, it was even better!,When the podcast presenters asked for other evidence of “listener sightings” of Cindy Sherman at MoMA, they received three responses, none of them matching the woman they had encountered. “I knew it was her was when she walked by me after making eye contact for the third time,” one listener wrote. “I saw her eyes and they were the same as the eyes in her work. She looked to be 300lbs in her fat suit...”Even more intrigued, Glass eventually managed to contact Sherman on the telephone. When told about the listener sightings at MoMA, she sounded fascinated, but replied that none of them was her. But, in a way, of course, all of them were.Cindy Sherman is at the National Portrait Gallery, London WC2, 27 June-15 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff917cda67f7b8a1f423995e5d5003397f814924/0_0_5055_3033/master/5055.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5542874753c304730b6e3a025f22249","title":"gaudis sagrada familia wins a building permit 137 years after work began","story":"Spanish architect’s masterpiece still unfinished but there’s now a chance its central towers will be completed Property owners have a new yardstick for measuring their frustration over building permit requests that are lost in the labyrinth of local government bureaucracy.Barcelona city hall has finally issued a work permit for the unfinished church designed by the architect Antoni Gaudí, 137 years after construction started on the Sagrada Família basilica.The city has granted the current builders a licence that is valid until 2026. The builders think that would be enough time to finish raising the landmark Roman Catholic church’s central towers.The basilica’s first stone was laid in 1882, but Barcelona officials said there was no record showing whether a building permit first requested in 1885 had ever been granted or rejected.They said the city would be paid €4.6m (£4.10m) in fees under an agreement negotiated with a foundation devoted to completing and preserving the Sagrada Família.Barcelona official Janet Sanz said the agreement between the city and the foundation had put an end to “a historical anomaly in our city”.More than 4.5 million visitors pay €17-€38 each to tour the basilica cathedral-sized church every year. The Barcelona government estimated 20 million tourists stand outside to marvel at the bell towers Gaudí envisioned 12 towers, one for each of Christ’s disciples, but they may never all be built.When completed, work on one of the central towers that is expected to get done while the building permit is valid would make La Sagrada Familía the tallest religious structure in Europe at 172.5 metres (566ft) tall, according to the builders.Barcelona has the largest concentration of buildings designed by Gaudí, whose bold aesthetic still inspires architects. A fervent Catholic, he dedicated much of his professional life to Sagrada Familía, which incorporates elements of Christian symbolism along with the organic forms often used by the architect.Gaudí died in 1926 after being struck by a trolley when just one facade was complete. He is buried in the church crypt.Ongoing construction work is based on the architect’s plaster models and photos and publications of his original drawings, which were destroyed in a 1930s fire, according to the Sagrada Familía foundation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f98a93716dff43ed28305e74e85cc762372f9da6/97_851_2316_1390/master/2316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3a907ffc9ec67800eb7babafd4523f2","title":"diary drawings daily instagram john hewitt manchester","story":"In June 2013, artist John Hewitt started making daily drawings inspired by his dog-walking encounters, and posting them on Instagram.

Get your hiking boots onIt’s hard to think of another state so richly blessed in the beautiful scenery department, and California seriously rewards travellers who take on its hiking trails. With big-hitter national parks such as Yosemite, Kings Canyon and Sequoia, Joshua Tree and Death Valley all easily drivable from San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, California is an ideal destination for those wanting to mix up a culture-crammed city break with awe-inspiring outdoor adventures.2. Eat the street at an iconic farmers’ marketCalifornia is deservedly proud of its fabulous fresh produce, with a farm-to-table dining scene that makes it the envy of the rest of the world. For Californians, the weekly farmers’ market has become a social institution akin to attending church, so plan to make a meal of visiting the Ferry Building Marketplace in San Francisco or San Luis Obispo’s friendly downtown market. San Diego in particular has made an art form of farmers’ markets, with countless neighbourhood markets popping up across town. If you’ve only got time to do one, make a Sunday pilgrimage to the LGBTQ-friendly, progressive neighbourhood of Hillcrest for their weekly 175-vendor market.3. Be put in your place by big treesSoaring coast redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) lace the coastline from just south of Big Sur to the Oregon border and beyond. Humboldt Redwoods state park is where you’ll find some of the oldest and tallest, and it’s easily accessed off Highway 101.“Farmers’ markets are a great way to support responsible travelling,” says Flight Centre’s Brown. “It’s pretty easy to do in Cali, as it’s the largest agricultural producer in the US.”4. Sip Chardonnay by the seaCalifornian wine is popular around the planet, but it really does taste better when you’re staring out at the crashing waves of the Pacific. A favourite spot is the clifftop restaurant of Nepenthe in Big Sur, where you can choose from more than 400 local tipples.5. Go vintage shopping in Joshua TreeThe other-worldly landscape of Joshua Tree national park is the area’s main draw, but a cluster of quirky desert communities are well worth lingering in. Close neighbours Pioneertown, Joshua Tree and Yucca Valley are all worth a snoop, and keep a particular eye out for the excellent vintage shopping on offer. Local designers and makers are showcased at Shop on the Mesa, while Hoof \u0026amp the Horn does excellent vintage gear, and The Station is a great spot to linger over a latte after finding some retro treasure. Rise with the birds at the weekend to snaffle bargains at the Sky Village Swap Meet before the sun gets into its stride.6. Cycle the beach path from Santa Monica to VeniceSanta Monica and the neighbouring, more hipster, Venice are LA’s best-loved city beach communities. Grab a Breeze bike and cruise down the coast, past the kitsch pier amusements, skateboarders, beachfront bars and fitness fanatics working out at Muscle Beach.7. Take a taco tour of LAWhat Indian food is to Londoners, Mexican cuisine is to Angelenos. The best taco trucks are found in the traditionally Hiic neighbourhoods of Echo Park and Los Feliz, as well as downtown. Stalk cult taco trucks Guerrilla Tacos and Korean-infused Kogi BBQ on Instagram (@guerillatacos and @kogibbq) to gorge like a local.8. Immerse yourself in San Francisco’s colourful cultureFew cities can claim the cultural clout of San Francisco – synonymous, as it is, with beat poetry, jazz and alternative rock, the 1970s counterculture movement, and LGBTQ voices. For literature lovers, sipping a beer in the Vesuvio Cafe beloved by beat generation writers Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, as well as the likes of Bob Dylan and Dylan Thomas, will send a shiver down your spine. The famous City Lights bookstore is literally next door.“The murals of San Francisco are an Instagrammer’s dream,” says Brown. “The Mission district has the highest concentration of street art of any neighbourhood in the world.”9. Breakfast with the stars in MalibuLA’s Malibu Farm Pier Cafe at the end of the pier is one of the best positioned beach cafes on the planet. If you can tear your eyes away from the sea views, you’ll spot local celebrities sipping Vietnamese coffees and nibbling avocado on toast behind oversized sunglasses.10. Laze by the pool in Palm SpringsA playground for the rich and famous since the Brat Pack made it their home in the 1950s, Palm Springs is a must-visit for lovers of modernist architecture, poolside bars and luxury hotels.

Absolutely great question, and let me thank you very much for what you do. Also, huge congratulations on your early 20s singledom – you have lots of time to figure out who you are but, more importantly, to read.Partners can be distractions when it comes to leisure time. Is it arrogant to start with my own novel, Queenie (Trapeze, £12.99)? Apologies, but it will help. It will show you how we twentysomethings are allowed to make mistakes, pick ourselves up and learn what works for us and what absolutely does not.Now that that’s out of the way, I’d suggest The Wrong Knickers, Bryony Gordon’s hilarious retelling of her “decade of chaos” through love and life that was all too relatable to me. If you want to laugh your way through a collection of no-holds-barred essays ranging on everything from failed relationships and IBS by way of bad sex, then Meaty by Samantha Irby is the collection for you.My Year of Rest and Relaxation by Ottessa Moshfegh is the weirdly addictive and languorous story of a young woman living in an apartment inherited from her dead parents on New York’s Upper East Side. She essentially takes enough prescription drugs to allow her to sleep through most of her days, lest she should have to face up to the realities of her 20s. You, as a junior doctor, can be the judge of how realistic that is.Finally, I would suggest Heartburn by Nora Ephron, one of the funniest books I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading over and over again. It taught me that even if we do navigate the confusing and sometimes brutal journey that is 20s singledom, the years beyond will have a lot of tricks in store for us, but we’ll be able to laugh our way through them.Submit your question for book clinic below or email bookclinic@observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97e8c0b4851462c7af42037166880befda2186c5/471_138_4856_2914/master/4856.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47c33193b5899019d00a5f72e0b20811","title":"nell freudenberger professors have to figure out how to behave with their students","story":"While writing her latest novel, the American author became obsessed with theoretical physics. She talks about sexism in science, falling in love with teachers and griefFew things bother Nell Freudenberger more than the way girls and women are still so often held back from studying science. For her new novel, Lost and Wanted, which follows Helen, an eminent theoretical physicist and single mother, as she mourns the death of her closest friend, Freudenberger set out to teach herself as much physics as she could. Growing up in New York City, she was, like so many other young women, encouraged to believe she didn’t “have the right kind of brain for it”. After doing badly in a maths test in her teens, she was told by a teacher that she might as well quit, and by the time she reached Harvard, hoping to study medicine, she was so far behind that “I couldn’t even take a remedial math class”.Abandoning the idea of medical school, she travelled in Asia after college, teaching English for a year in Thailand, and then found early success as a writer, publishing her first story in the New Yorker in her mid-20s after being discovered during an internship there. She hopes her own two children will keep going with maths, “especially my daughter”, but fears they won’t. “It breaks my heart,” she says of the new book, “to see people on social media, especially women, saying: ‘I’d like to read this book but I’m a little intimidated, it sounds like it might be hard.’ Please give it a chance. It doesn’t have to be my book you can read any of the books in the acknowledgments, just read one and prove to yourself that you can understand it. Someone has told you you can’t.”She notes that, unfortunately, it’s not only in schools that people are hearing these harmful messages. Indignant, she mentions a lecture given last year at Cern by Italian physicist Alessandro Strumia, who said that physics was “invented and built by men, it’s not by invitation”, and claimed that women receive fewer citations in the field because differences in brain structure make them less capable of high level research (Strumia has since been suspended by Cern). “It seems almost like those arguments aren’t worth answering – but apparently they need to be answered,” says Freudenberger. For her own part, she found the process of researching the scientific concepts in Lost and Wanted “thrilling”, spending hours in conversation with physicists and reading papers on quantum entanglement. “One of the really beautiful things about the physics world,” she says, is that all the literature is made available online for anyone to read, and she found that researchers were “exceedingly warm and open and eager to explain their work”. Such was her excitement that a friend who read an early draft of the novel had to gently tell her to cool it on the science.All three of Freudenberger’s previous works of fiction, Lucky Girls, The Dissident and The Newlyweds, focus on cultures she did not grow up in, and for her, as she worked on Lost and Wanted, physics became “sort of another country”, giving her “that heightened sense of experience that I get from travelling”. After her early success in the New Yorker, Freudenberger’s story collection Lucky Girls won the PENMalamud award, she received a Guggenheim fellowship and a Whiting award and appeared on the New Yorker’s “20 under 40” list in 2010. This time around, she “did not start out to write a book about a physicist”, and had first intended the novel to be “more personal” – in an early abandoned version, the first-person narrator was a novelist: “I should have known how boring that would be,” she laughs. “I don’t know what I was thinking!” She found that she couldn’t sustain her own interest when “trying to do something that’s too close to home”. “I wanted to write a book about a woman who was passionate about her work,” she says, “but the book was just sort of dead on the page.” There was an astrophysicist in that draft, “a minor character, and he was male, like the only astrophysicists I had ever known”. Then it occurred to her that she could rewrite it, giving her protagonist a new profession.When Freudenberger’s publishers initially asked her, “Did you intend to write somebody who was so cold?” she replied: “I was just trying to write about myself!” More seriously, she talks about wanting to explore a narrator who “keeps secrets from herself. I was thinking about Chang-Rae Lee’s A Gesture Life or Kazuo Ishiguro’s The Remains of the Day – of someone who has a real distance between what they’re thinking and what they’re feeling, their feelings are not always clear to them.” Not that she espouses the notion that scientists see the world differently from nonscientists in any fundamental way. When she asked one physicist whether there was something in daily life that he thinks about differently because he’s a physicist, he eventually said: “Well, I’m not afraid when I’m on a plane, because I know exactly how planes work.”Lost and Wanted is ided into sections titled “Entanglement”, “Gravity” and “Uncertainty”, but Freudenberger was aware of the dangers of misusing scientific metaphor, knowing that a person like her protagonist “would disdain the lazy use of the uncertainty principle – novelists and playwrights love the uncertainty principle.” Nonetheless, she says, “the concepts just seemed to go with what was happening emotionally for the characters: entanglement is such a beautiful metaphor for friendship, and the collision of two black holes and the gravitational waves that emanate from them is so much like what happens with grief.” Her approach changed after a conversation with a physicist who was using figurative language to explain something to her about black holes, and who gave her something like a “permission slip” for metaphor. “He said: ‘You know, our three-dimensional brains are not equipped to understand these things without analogies – you just have to make sure that the analogies are the right ones.’”The emotional centre of the novel is grief, and while revising the book, Freudenberger lost a close friend, the composer Michael Friedman, who died unexpectedly in his early 40s and to whom the novel is dedicated. She compares the initial shock of losing someone to the feeling she had after childbirth: “I couldn’t believe that there were people just going about their regular business. I thought I must be a different type of creature, like I didn’t really feel human any more. You just feel so separate from anybody else who hasn’t had the exact same experience.”In one memorable scene Helen goes to the Harvard office of a professor, whose inappropriate advances towards her late friend Charlie had ended her promising academic career years before. The professor is suave and engaged, discussing the finer points of Helen’s book on black holes, giving her his insights on Rousseau, modernity, love and moral ambiguity. It takes him a short while to figure out her connection to his former student.Freudenberger, though she “certainly didn’t set out to write something that had to do with #MeToo”, was interested in how common it is for people to “describe their lives being completely derailed” by small, subtle interactions. It’s rarely a clear case of wrongdoing that can be called out, she observes, and yet so many people have ended up in entirely different careers from the ones they intended to pursue because, say, “that would have entailed asking him for a recommendation and I didn’t want to do that”. She gives her professor character arguments taken from Pankaj Mishra’s Age of Anger, though, she says: “I hate to borrow from somebody who I really admire personally and intellectually and give some of their ideas to a nefarious character. But I wanted him to be intellectually appealing in the way that professors are, to be able to make his case.”The argument made so often by creepy professors to justify crossing the line with their students – “but literature is about love, teaching is about seduction” – strikes her as important to address. We all fall in love with professors, male or female, regardless of sexual preference, she says. “It doesn’t really have to do with that. You fall in love with someone’s mind. And professors have to figure out how to behave with their students.” So many different obstacles can scotch a woman’s academic career, whether in the arts or the sciences. Freudenberger experienced sexism early in her own trajectory, all the small indignities and public underminings that came along with her first lucky break: “having my picture taken, having articles written about whether I was just having the story published because my picture looked nice, because I was 26”.

Just that sort of thing – relentlessly, globally, forever. Other than that, LGBTQ people have got it easy.So consider people so dense one imagines a microwaved cheeseburger where their brains should be – what about oppressed straight guys? Who will speak for them?Take the US men’s rights group, Super Happy Fun America (SHFA), which applied for a permit to hold a “Straight Pride” parade in Boston to “celebrate the erse history, culture and contributions of the straight community”. As yet, they have been unsuccessful. (Boston’s mayor, Marty Walsh, preferred to concentrate on the city’s LGBTQ Pride celebrations.) Another setback came in the form of Brad Pitt, who insisted that SHFA stop using his name and likeness on its site, almost as if being associated with knuckle-dragging homophobia was embarrassing or disgusting or something.Enter “alt-right” controversy-merchant Milo Yiannopoulos, who proclaimed himself delighted to be Straight Pride’s new mascot. Confusingly, he is gay, but at least he’s available – after his book was dropped by his publisher and Facebook permanently banned him. Last year, things got so bad it was reported that British-born Yiannopoulos had applied to join Ukip. With his contrarian track record, it’s perhaps unsurprising that he has seemingly opted to “come out” as a self-hating gay man who hangs out with homophobes and we should all put aside our prejudices and be happy for him.Obviously, those involved with SHFA are engaged in a massive wind-up, although they probably believe that they’re making an astute game-changing point about identity politics and that straight men are oppressed in these politically correct times. I’m sure there are corners of the dark net where such musings would be applauded by gruff, mysteriously single, MAGA baseball cap-wearing men, when they’re not complaining about frigid modern women or researching sarin gas.In the real world, there’s a good reason why Gay Pride needs to exist and Straight Pride doesn’t. Straight people, especially white straight people, don’t have to stand up for their rights. They’re OK, to the point where they can afford to budge up a bit and give different types of people space to breathe.Straight men such as those behind Straight Pride are auto-celebrated, auto-protected and auto-privileged every second of every minute of every day of their whingeing, resentful, spiteful lives. Perhaps they should hold a parade about that.Has disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein got his mojo back? Madonna, who worked with Weinstein on her 1991 documentary, Truth or Dare, has said that when she heard of Weinstein’s fall from grace, she thought “finally”, adding: “It was good that somebody who’d been abusing his power for so many years was called out and held accountable.”Weinstein responded with a statement weaving in Madonna song titles: “It’s surprising that she conformed to what’s in Vogue… I will not Justify My terrific feelings for her … She was that Ray of Light whom I will always Cherish… if getting on this bandwagon helps her sell records, Turn Up the Radio.”And more in that vein – from a man facing criminal charges (which he denies) and embroiled in a lawsuit and a reported $44m settlement. Yet it seems he still feels safe and entitled enough to engage in excruciating, immature snark.Has the meaning of the word “inappropriate” still not sunk in? Doesn’t he realise that the days of people faux-guffawing at his “jokes” are over (“Hilarious, Harv, do Taylor Swift songs now!”)?In this spirit of wordplay, here are two more words for Weinstein: “grow” and “up”.Congratulations to Sharon White, the new executive chairman of John Lewis. The soon-to-be ex-chief executive for Ofcom was, prior to that, the first black person to serve as permanent secretary to the Treasury. White, also recently tipped to be the next governor of the Bank of England, will be paid a basic salary of £990,000, to oversee John Lewis department stores and the Waitrose supermarket chain.One grumble: White was allowed to pick her own title, so it’s a little disappointing that she chose chairman. Why not chairwoman, chairperson or, my favourite, Queen of Retail Narnia? I know I’m being facetious, but surely this was an opportunity to break down some of those tired, male-dominated business ways? Other than that, John Lewis should be commended for its bold move.If the collapse of Debenhams is anything to go by, then the very last thing brands should do is keep sticking to outmoded formulas in the hope that things will magically get better. John Lewis inspires more customer loyalty than most, but there isn’t a magic wand to make the likes of Amazon go away. Good luck to Ms White – in this climate, even audacious maverick choices are going to need a hell of a lot of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/374e7693c7f515400dc437ce49c7d46e967c3be8/0_0_4891_3069/master/4891.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd13e8a99630e0daefb01c6829fbcb9c 700w","title":"ashes to ashes 20 how womens cricket developed to embrace new formats","story":"Ahead of this summer’s Women’s Ashes tour, Kalika Mehta takes a look back at the tournament’s history, from its unofficial beginning in the 1930sAlthough women’s competitive cricket dates back to the foundation of the Women’s Cricket Association (WCA) in 1926, it wasn’t until eight years later that an England team set sail for Australia for their first “unofficial” Ashes tour.With the hosts refusing to pay travel expenses, the team consisted of players who could afford the considerable £80 – nearly £5,000 in modern-day terms – charged by the WCA. If that didn’t rule out a large enough section of society, married women were also barred from selection – on the grounds that it would not be appropriate for them to be away from home for a six-month tour.The youthful team – all were under 25 – set off for Australia with a squad of seven teachers or future teachers, two secretaries, an art student, a lawyer, a nurse, and three “ladies of leisure” – plus Myrtle Maclagan, who was employed by the army.Having agreed to not smoke, drink, gamble or find themselves “accompanied by a man”, England’s players were also far more prepared than their Australian counterparts, who only began searching for players 28 days before the first Test was due to begin.Unsurprisingly, England romped to victory. All-rounder Maclagan sent down a searing spell to earn figures of 7-10 and rattle out Australia for 47 in the first innings – picking up the first five-wicket haul in a women’s international in the process.Maclagan followed that up with another impressive milestone, hitting 72 of the visitors’ first-innings score of 154. Though the home side were more resilient with the bat at the second time of asking, England comfortably knocked off the required 32 runs to secure a nine-wicket win.The second Test at the historic Sydney Cricket Ground followed much the same pattern. Maclagan’s century in England’s first innings was the highlight of a match that saw the visitors requiring just 10 runs in the second innings.Although this eight-wicket victory sealed the series, there was no trophy for England captain Betty Archdale to raise in triumph – the WCA’s founding constitution, set out in 1930, proclaimed that “no member of any affiliated club shall take part in any cricket challenge cup or prize competition”.England retained the Ashes on home soil in 1937 after a drawn series and the second world war put paid to the scheduled 1939-40 Ashes it wasn’t until the winter of 1948-49 that England’s players set out for Australia once more. This time around, the hosts were much better prepared. The team were fitter and more skilful, and the crowd of 17,025 across three days in Adelaide – still the highest for a women’s Test in Australia – cheered on a comprehensive 186-run victory, which gave the Australians a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Australian all-rounder Betty Wilson – who turned down three marriage proposals during the  of her international career in order to continue playing cricket – was the undoubted star of the Test. Her brilliant knock of 111 – ended by run-out – was followed by a six-wicket haul, then 3-39 in the second innings.Although the following Tests were more competitive, two draws earned Australia’s women their maiden Ashes series victory. Scoring 268 runs and picking up an impressive 16 wickets across the three matches, Wilson stood head and shoulders above the rest of the players. But still no trophy.It took 34 more Tests and more than 64 years for England and Australia’s women to have something to fight over. In 1998, a miniature bat was burned in a wok in the Harris Garden at Lord’s on July 20, and the ashes were placed in a small wooden trophy.Also in the wok was a copy of the WCA constitution and rulebook – the WCA was finished, having voted to merge with the newly formed England and Wales Cricket Board, and it seemed only right that its “no prize” rule go up in smoke.England were unable to break Australia’s dominance at that stage, however, and the Southern Stars retained the Ashes until 2005 (which some will remember as a good year for the men too).In 2013, the Ashes changed from being Test-only to consist of one Test, three one-day internationals and three T20 Internationals. Six points were awarded for a Test win, or two points for a draw, with two points awarded for a limited-over win and one for a draw.Although the Test match in 2013 was drawn, England triumphed in two ODIs and three T20s to win the home series 12-4 and reclaim the Ashes. A second – but closer – series win followed in Australia, less than six months later, before the format was tweaked in 2015 to reduce a Test win to four points Australia have won then retained the Ashes since.While so much of women’s sport struggles to emerge from the shadows of the men’s game, or strives to emulate it, the Women’s Ashes has always forged its own path, with four-day Tests – an option often discussed for the men’s game – and now an exciting multi-format competition that has opened up new audiences.But it would be nothing without the players, and these days those players come from all walks of life. Cricket Charity Chance to Shine has introduced 4 million state school children to the game since 2005, 2 million of whom are girls, and NatWest has partnered with the charity to ensure this important work continues.

In 1966 he moved to Britain, where he had his first solo exhibition in 1969. During the 1980s he was a tutor at Goldsmiths College, where he taught many of the emerging Young British Artists. His work has been exhibited all over the world, and his latest show, Michael Craig-Martin: Sculpture, is at Gagosian, Britannia Street, London, until 3 August.I’ve just come back from Venice, and of course the Biennale is on, but this is the thing I saw that most overwhelmed me. It’s a stunning 16th-century palazzo and has two exhibitions – one ancient and one modern – in the same place. The first is a beautiful collection of abstract paintings by Helen Frankenthaler, from 1952 to 1992. There is also a room called the Tribuna: it’s full of classical arches, alcoves, niches and pedestals, with more than 100 classical sculptures of different gods and goddesses, in different scales. You will never see a more extraordinary place.I was recently in Abu Dhabi for a conference, and though I had read and heard about the Louvre, I was unprepared for how absolutely fantastic it is. It’s a very low, gentle dome, like a geometric metal grid in several layers, so that light filters through. It’s open, so if it rains, the water will come through. The materials, the proportion and just everything about the interior is beautifully done – then you go through and come out into a plaza with water on all sides. I don’t think I’ve ever been to a museum that was more beautiful.I was taken by a friend, knowing nothing about the film, and I was floored. At the peak of her power in 1972, Aretha Franklin decided to make a recording of authentic gospel music, with an audience, in a Baptist church. Sydney Pollack filmed it, but bizarrely didn’t use clapperboards, and after it was filmed it was impossible to match the sound recording with the visuals. Now producer Alan Elliott has been able to do it using digital technology, and it’s extraordinary – it gives you the sense that you’re there. I found myself weeping through half of it.I didn’t watch this originally, then I saw it won all the awards, so naturally I got curious and watched it on BBC iPlayer. What an amazing series: the characters are so special, so eccentric – every single person is such an inidual. The confrontations between the psychopath and her pursuer, and their bizarre bonding – you’re constantly waiting to see what’s going to happen next, and it’s never what you expect. It seemed very contemporary and very stylish, and I found myself watching four or five episodes at a time.This is the funniest thing on radio. It’s supposed to be about Vita Sackville-West at Sissinghurst and her circle of friends, and their names have been slightly altered: she becomes Vera Sackcloth-Vest, Virginia Woolf is Ginny Fox. In one episode, the Prince of Wales comes to see the garden at “Sizzlinghurst” and he’s making a pass at Vita, then two unexpected guests arrive – Gertrude Stein and Wallis Simpson – and he quickly drops Vita to go off with Wallis. The cast, including Miriam Margolyes , John Sessions and Alison Steadman, are fabulous and clearly having so much fun. It’s simply marvellous.When I was in Venice I was invited to dinner here. The Dolci has a beautiful terrace, but it was too cold, so we went inside, which you wouldn’t normally do. It was quite a large room, very classic: elegant but not fancy, with quite simple decor. The restaurant is extraordinarily expensive and has an amazing reputation. Very often places that have such reputations are not so wonderful in reality, but everything we had was impeccably done. I’ve had sea bass many times, but this was the best I’ve ever had."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edb7d6b5264a425ff2452ca0a1a41ad5f84f5621/0_242_1428_857/master/1428.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd0090eb5257eacb228e092829beba39","title":"micro festivals boom food culture","story":"Social media is bringing people together for more than 18,000 niche interest events around Britain this yearWhen Eleanor Taylor decided to set up her own oyster festival in the Essex town of Maldon last year, even she didn’t really believe it would take off. At best she expected a couple of hundred people to show up. Maldon isn’t exactly Galway or Whitstable after all, and there was no tradition of celebrating salty-sweet molluscs.But once social media caught wind of it, foodies snapped up the tickets. “It wasn’t quite Glastonbury but it got to the point where 6,000 tickets had been bought in two weeks,” Taylor says. “Then the council told me I had to declare it sold out.”It was so popular, in fact, that this year’s event has been moved to a bigger site, capable of hosting more than 30,000 oyster-lovers – and Taylor says she expects to fill it.“It’s generated such a buzz, the whole town’s got behind it – the shops, the restaurants, the fishermen. When I walk around now, people say, ‘Oh, you’re the oyster lady’ – like I’ve been doing it for 40 years!”Taylor’s is a good example of a fast-growing breed of boutique festivals that are popping up all over Britain, with numbers doubling in the past year to more than 18,000.The phenomenon has its roots in America, says Paul McCrudden, whose San Francisco-based company, Eventbrite, allows users to post details of their upcoming events and manage the flow of budding participants for everything from knitting festivals to toe-wrestling.That’s how Shonette Bason saw it too. Fed up with what she calls “moaning lemon suckers”, Bason decided to create her own festival based on the science of happiness. The idea was to bring as many positive people together as possible, even though Bason, a self-styled happiness guru, was aware that her chirpy disposition meant “I just irritate people all the time!” To her surprise, though, about 1,000 like-minded souls flocked to a warehouse in Old Trafford in Manchester last summer. And they were happy enough to pay £30 a pop to hear Bason’s motivational tips on ditching the grimace and staying tip-top.“People are always telling us why we should be miserable but there is nobody telling us how we can be happy,” says Bason, whose festival travels to Birmingham this year in an attempt to spread positive vibes across the Midlands.Happiness is actually really easy, she says. “You just go back to your childhood, you know, those days when you rolled down grass hills and didn’t check for dog poo.”For Ken Davis, happiness is a cup of tea – so last year he set about creating the Great British Tea Festival, staged in an old railway house in Derby.Like the Essex oysters, Davis had limited expectations he even thought it might just be himself and a small gaggle of workmates.But in the end, 800 people paid £3.95 a ticket to sip teas from all over the world and listen to Davis enthuse about one of his favourite pastimes. “I simply couldn’t believe it,” he says.A second festival is set for October, with more than 1,000 tea-lovers expected to turn up for a brew. “It’s kind of an old-fashioned thing – perhaps that’s why people like it,” says Davis.Eleanor Taylor says she believes micro-festivals such as these are taking off because they focus on simple values, with the idea of family and community at their heart.“They’re indicative of a country that is feeling miserable and uncertain,” she says. “We all just want to enjoy ourselves when we can.”That’s why this year, Bason, the happiness guru, has hired a 60-piece female Welsh choir to feature as the centrepiece of her next festival. “People want human connection,” she says.“Put a thousand people together, and they’re bound to feel happy.”The Legendary Llangollen Fairy Festival, 10-11 AugustFeaturing storytelling, circus skills workshops and live music.The Shortish Scything Festival, Spittalfield, Perthshire, 27JulyA homage to the scythe – hone your technique in a meadow.Festival of Wheels, Ipswich, 3-4 AugustTractor pulling, 10-ton American trucks, BMX."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8873510166a83a1b7613044641fa0dea51b1f332/145_577_3819_2291/master/3819.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=054c02520a37a93a0d1abf9f0876580f","title":"chernobyl now i was not afraid of radiation a photo essay","story":"Photographer Tom Skipp visited Chernobyl and nearby Pripyat, its replacement town Slavutych, and the abandoned sites of the region – meeting the people behind the disaster: from the liquidators who worked at the fallout site, to the resettlers and the community who live and work in the area nowI arrived in Ukraine on the eve of the 32nd anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster. I had not intended for it to be the focus of my time in Kyiv, but leading up to my departure it became an obsession. My arrival in Kyiv on 25 April 2018 was maybe happenstance of planning but I was impelled to head straight from the airport to Slavutych. This was the town built to replace Pripyat and host the evacuated personnel of the Chernobyl power plant, after the decision was made to continue power production following the disaster. All of the Soviet republics were called upon to hurriedly help with the construction of what would eventually be the last atomic town.Liquidators. This term became my obsession. They were the people who had tended to the Chernobyl fallout. A lesser known name for them was “the green machines”, a reference to the colour of their uniforms and the fact that, where machines would fail because of the unimaginably high levels of radiation, they would not.What I saw in Slavutych at 1.24am, the time when the nuclear reactor in Chernobyl power plant exploded 32 years ago, was a solemn outpouring of raw emotion. Representatives of the church, scientists and members of the army mixed to pay tribute to a group of people who fought an invisible war against the atom. Later that day, at the town museum, a group of liquidator veterans had gathered for me to interview and photograph them. Following those encounters, I made my way to the home of another man, Iakov Mamedov. “There were 12 people in my hospital ward, only four survived. The others were just covered and taken away.”I knew I had to go to the exclusion zone. I had been in contact with the head of communications of the power plant and eventually was given approval to enter the plant and take photos. It is very simple to get to the zone as a tourist, as many operators organise day trips from Kyiv, but I wanted to go alone. Vitali was appointed as my guide to organise my itinerary and make sure I did not go where I should not. The 19-mile radius exclusion zone includes the site of the nuclear power plant, but also abandoned villages, a children’s holiday camp, the Duga military radar and it is inhabited by a group of people known as “resettlers”. After the accident, the zone was completely evacuated and locals were told they would have returned to their homes within two or three days. Residents , however, were never officially allowed back. Some people decided the need to stay in their home was greater than the risk of living in a radioactive area and illegally made their way back.Soon after entering the exclusion zone, I discovered my permission to visit the station had been overturned. On the same day, in Chernobyl town – where 1,500 people still work, servicing the power plant – my guide and I remained locked in the local museum, and had to jump out of a first-floor toilet window to get out. Then I blew a tyre, which meant changing it under what I paranoically assumed was radioactive rain. It felt like a post-Soviet cloud of bad luck was following me in my every move.The source of the nuclear fallout, now encased in a steel and concrete sarcophagus, can only be photographed from one angle, with tourists dutifully disembarking from their tour buses to snap the shot.Nearby, there are cooling lakes full of oversized fish. They used to be farmed to feed bears for the local fur industry, but after the accident the furs were too contaminated to be worn and the fish were left to their own device.The people working at the power plant do so usually for 10 days at a time, to service, monitor and safeguard the power plant, which is about five miles away.Resettler Vasiliy Semyonovych Razumenko at his home in the exclusion zone. Vasiliy claims to be 113 years old, although records say he is 95. He used to work at a shipyard in Odesa.“Tell them this old bastard is still alive,” were his parting words. “Those men in the shipyard I worked with, tell them Vasiliy is still breathing.”Hanna has looked after her younger sister, Sonya, since she was born. They live on their small farmed land, food brought by the military police and donations from tourists.Pripyat is the closest town to the power plant. It used to be the shining example of Soviet modernity, with nuclear scientists from around the world visiting it every year. In the centre of the abandoned town sits the amusement park that was supposed to open on 1 May 1986. The rusty ferris wheel has become iconic of the Chernobyl dystopia.The very nature of the disaster means that everything is frozen as it was at the time of the accident and nothing should be touched because of fear of radiations.The exclusion zone covers around 1,000 sq miles. From the area, about 91,000 people were evacuated. Within the zone, there was a secret military facility containing part of the Duga radar system, a Soviet missile defence radar.The location that interested me the most was a children’s holiday camp that lays abandoned just off a main road in the zone of alienation. I had not seen many photographs of it before, but it seemed to sum up the thousands of innocent lives that had been affected by the Chernobyl accident, and the reasoning behind the unquestioning sacrifice of the liquidators.What at first had seemed to me illogical self-sacrifice, not unlike the nonsense of going to war, started to make sense in this abandoned Soviet paradise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d143e03bccd1150ef52b8b6abd7f3e46885ea1b3/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f21d7fe9cb5f7e19369fb69f77f54f2","title":"forest bathing japanese practice in west wellbeing","story":"The Japanese have known for years that spending mindful time in the woods is beneficial for body and soul. Now western doctors – and royals – agreeEvery day, apart from when it’s raining heavily, Dr Qing Li heads to a leafy park near the Nippon Medical School in Tokyo where he works. It’s not just a pleasant place to eat his lunch he believes the time spent under the trees’ canopy is a critical factor in the fight against diseases, of the mind and body.Once a month Li spends three days in forests near Tokyo, using all five senses to connect with the environment and clear his mind. This practice of shinrin-yoku – literally, forest bath – has the power to counter illnesses including cancer, strokes, gastric ulcers, depression, anxiety and stress, he says. It boosts the immune system, lowers blood pressure and aids sleep. And soon it could be prescribed by British doctors.Last week the Woodland Trust suggested forest bathing – which doesn’t, despite its name, involve getting in water – should be among a range of non-medical therapies and activities recommended by GPs’ surgeries to boost patients’ boost wellbeing.“Social prescribing”, a growing movement in the NHS, can include volunteering, gardening, sports activities, cookery and befriending.“Forest bathing is an opportunity for people to take time out, slow down and connect with nature. We think it could be part of the mix of activities for social prescription,” Stuart Dainton of the Woodland Trust told the Observer. “Evidence about its benefits is building.”The Duchess of Cambridge is a fan, and the garden she co-designed at the Chelsea Flower Show last month was inspired by shinrin-yoku. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds is introducing a series of forest bathing events across the country this summer. Forestry England, which manages public woodland, has endorsed the practice as a way of regaining balance and escaping the pressures of everyday life.Shinrin-yoku was developed in the 1980s in Japan. Although people had been taking walks in the country’s forests for centuries, new studies showed that such activity could reduce blood pressure, lower cortisol levels and improve concentration and memory. A chemical released by trees and plants, called phytoncides, was found to boost the immune system. As more research highlighted the benefits of shinrin-yoku, the Japanese government incorporated it into the country’s health programme.His book offers this advice for the practice of shinrin-yoku: “Make sure you have left your phone and camera behind. You are going to be walking aimlessly and slowly. You don’t need any devices. Let your body be your guide. Listen to where it wants to take you. Follow your nose. And take your time. It doesn’t matter if you don’t get anywhere. You are not going anywhere. You are savouring the sounds, smells and sights of nature and letting the forest in.”Gary Evans, who set up the Forest Bathing Institute in the UK last year, said: “People initially think they’ve been doing this all their lives: going for a walk in the woods. But it might be a brisk walk, or you might be worrying about where the dog has got to.“A better way to frame forest bathing is mindful time spent under the canopy of trees for health and wellbeing purposes.”A typical session might last three hours, and begin with an explanation of the history and science of shinrin-yoku. “Then it’s about sensory exercises,” said Evans. “We try to hold people’s attention in the present moment, to give their bodies and minds a chance to slow down. We move very slowly, touching the trees, looking at colours and patterns, and breathing deeply. We end up lying down under trees and looking up through the branches.”Shades of green and blue, the colours of the forest and the sky, were the most relaxing, he said. Looking at nature’s patterns helped to stop thoughts spinning in the head.After a slow start, interest in forest bathing had taken off, Evans said. Officials from national and local government have made inquiries, and Evans addressed 40 doctors at Frimley Park hospital in Surrey last month on the benefits. GPs in the county have expressed interest in social prescribing of forest bathing. The Forest Bathing Institute is training people to become shinrin-yoku guides.“The rocket ship has left the launch pad,” Evans said. “There is a growing recognition by the medical profession of the value of forest bathing. But we’re 40 years behind Japan. We need doctors and scientists here to start some studies on the physiological and psychological impact.”One UK study, carried out by King’s College London and published in January 2018, found that exposure to trees, the sky and birdsong in cities improved mental wellbeing. The benefits were still evident several hours after the exposure.“Even just 20 minutes can help, though 10 hours a month is even better,” said Dainton. “If you live in a city, you may not be able to get to a forest easily, but taking off your shoes in the park and feeling the grass will help you de-stress.”A study of 585 Japanese people published last year said that city dwellers were “constantly exposed to stressors” and that “urban living is associated with increased risk of health problems”, including anxiety, depression and psychosis.It concluded: “The psychological benefits of walking through forests are very significant … Urban planners should pay more attention to maintaining and increasing accessible greenery in urban areas. The beneficial effects of nature suggest a simple, accessible and cost-effective method to improve the quality of life and health of urban residents.”A recognition that health can be affected by a wide range of factors, including employment, housing, debt, social isolation and culture. An estimated one in five patients consult their GP for what is primarily a social problem. Traditional medical interventions and treatments do not help, so doctors and other professionals are increasingly interested in suggesting, or prescribing, non-clinical activities and services to improve wellbeing.Examples of social prescribing schemes include cookery classes and healthy eating advice, volunteering, sports and exercise groups, gardening (as practised by the Duchess of Cambridge, above), arts activities and group learning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac9e47da54e2f5310435e703d014c78857de565f/0_265_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3dc3db79708dfe7d8b56a87f84bdb9d","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"White tiger cubs, urban deer and many millions of ladybirds"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc133eea5f8c98957a5848b042ff6e04a7ce4dc8/0_173_3082_1850/master/3082.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f282b2f9fe96e1e5babff53207435e71","title":"back fashion essential sales soar uk women buying","story":"Sales of chic brands of knapsacks are soaring – and it’s women who are driving the trendThey used to be carried by the slightly awkward-looking kids in the school playground or hikers and were much more likely to be sported by men than women. But now, go to any high street, office or packed rush-hour bus and the humble backpack is everywhere.“There has been an enormous change in attitudes towards day packs,” says Ralph White, UK managing director of the Swedish rucksack brand Fjällräven. Of course, it should be no surprise that women are using a style of bag that is practical and – increasingly – stylish, too. But it has taken something of a shift in attitudes for the backpack to find mainstream traction in workplaces – and gender parity. As with many things, Miuccia Prada was a pioneer: when she released a nylon rucksack, made from military parachute fabric, in 1984, it was considered radical. All the other bags around were, she said in a recent interview with Vogue magazine, “so formal, so lady, so traditional”.In the past, style blogger and backpack-wearer Susie Lau, aka Susie Bubble, has cited the Phoebe Philo effect. As former designer at Celine, Philo led the charge for what many brand “ugly” fashion, from Birkenstocks and clogs to backpacks.Skipping forward to 2016, Burberry’s monogrammed backpacks were the elevated version that convinced the likes of Cara Delevingne to embrace the look. At the Tribeca film festival last year Sarah Jessica Parker, the woman to thank for sparking many an impractical tiny handbag trend, was spotted wearing a rucksack on the red carpet. On the Prada men’s AW19 catwalk they were worn by Gigi Hadid and Kaia Gerber, and Chanel’s 2020 Cruise show featured a tweed backpack.With many high-fashion brands, from Gucci to Coach, making rucksacks the mid range of the market seeing a proliferation of more sophisticated designs – from the likes of Herschel to Dr Martens – and more than 400 styles offered on Asos, backpacks have come a long way from the days of Power Rangers or My Little Pony bags.The rucksack’s fashion credentials have been bolstered by the rise of gorpcore – a neologism coined in 2017 from the acronym “gorp”, which stands for “granola, oats, raisins, peanuts”, aka trail mix, and encompasses all manner of camping attire. The ongoing popularity of luxury sportswear has helped make rucksacks less back-of-the-bus and more chia seeds and balasana. With the rise of the urban hiker look last year, the field trip look went high-fashion. “The outdoors as a whole has definitely got more fashionable,” says White. Plus it’s come into cities.With some of the most popular brands hailing from Sweden, they play into our era’s love of all things Scandi. As White explains: “There has definitely been a rise in the popularity of Scandinavian culture – from hygge to fika. Fjällräven takes a very Scandinavian approach to its product design.” Its now-iconic Kånken, was introduced as a bag for Swedish children in 1978.The sheer practicality of the rucksack is a plus point, too. Backpacks are “easy to wear, hands-free, fuss-free and comfy,” says Georgie Tym, a lecturer at Cordwainers, the shoes and accessories brand of London College of Fashion. Function appears to be winning over any lingering competition from archaic, gendered double standards. If Danielle Drake, PR manager at Sandqvist, a high-end Swedish bag brand, is to be believed, the backpack is to bags what flats are to high heels. “The past pressure of having to cram all of your gear into a shoulder bag just for the sake of dated perceptions on women’s workplace attire has no place in today’s world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/835401e532224518790fd3441bcd8b99c9915304/0_761_2898_1738/master/2898.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8888c1dfbe6a3591b2de99f9bc6c686","title":"alice lowe interview sometimes always never","story":"The actor, writer and Prevenge director on demonic possession and the cathartic possibilities of ScrabbleAlice Lowe has starred in Garth Marenghi’s Darkplace, The Mighty Boosh, Hot Fuzz and Ben Wheatley’s Sightseers, which she co-wrote. In 2016 she wrote, directed and starred in Prevenge, and last year appeared in Black Mirror: Bandersnatch. Next she stars alongside Bill Nighy and Sam Riley in Sometimes Always Never, a film written by Frank Cottrell Boyce about a Scrabble-loving family coping with a loss, to be released in cinemas on 14 June.What attracted you to the project?Frank Cottrell Boyce is on my list of people I’d say yes to, even if he asked me to play a paper bag. And when I found out Bill Nighy was involved, I was over the moon. It’s a really warm comedy, without being soppy or cheesy – it’s wry and witty, with lots of surprising humour.Like Prevenge, it seems to be about one thing (demonic possession, Scrabble) but actually deals with loss and grief. Is there something in the British psyche that struggles with articulating these things more directly?Definitely. It’s about families not saying what they mean to each other, all that miscommunication. That’s quite a British thing – everybody knows something’s the case, but it’s just never spoken about. And there’s all this repression. The one positive is that it’s often really funny. For me, Prevenge was an explosion, a primal scream about stuff we don’t talk about, that we keep concealed and civilised. Sometimes Always Never, in a very gentle way, is really cathartic as well. It’s about a family letting those emotions go and being healthier for it.What did you find most satisfying about creating Prevenge?A sense of freedom. I was just like: “Ah, I get to do stuff the way I want, and everybody has to listen to me, because I’m the director.” I can’t wait to direct again, which I’m doing this summer: a film called Timestalker, which I’ve been working on for a couple of years. It’s a fantasy, in a way, about reincarnation. It’s going to be funny, but with bits of horror and melancholy.Presumably, now that Prevenge has done well, it gives you more freedom?I think so. My dream is to be allowed to do my thing – it’s this idea of an auteur. I don’t know how many women get called auteurs, but I like the idea of it. It’s a really pretentious word, which is partly why I like it, but it also means you get to do what you want.What’s the most challenging part of directing?Probably my fear that I might offend other actors by telling them what to do. The way I get around that is by just trusting them to do whatever they want. It will be different directing with a toddler as well: before, she was in my tummy, which makes her a lot easier to keep your eye on. Luckily, the company, Western Edge Pictures, who also did Prevenge, are so supportive of me being a mum – that is vital.Is there a widening understanding of this in the industry?Definitely – there was a creche for the first time in Cannes this year, and I support Raising Films, a charity all about parents and carers working in the film industry. Being a film-maker shouldn’t mean you have to be completely antisocial and never see your family – it’s not very self-sustaining.Why do you think it’s taken so long to have women on screen – in things like Prevenge, Killing Eve, Fleabag – who behave badly but are still likable and three-dimensional?It’s changed so much. Some of the reason I started writing was my frustration, as an actress, at the lack of erse roles for women – they’d be really one-dimensional and boring. But there’s this whole wave coming through, which is really exciting. We pitched Sightseers as a TV idea a few years ago and no-one wanted it they were like, “You can’t have violence and comedy in the same show.” That would seem ridiculous now – that’s changed in just seven, eight years.What do you think the future holds for choose-your-own-adventure type narratives, like Bandersnatch?I think there’ll always be a place for conventional film, because there are always going to be people who want to know what the exact narrative is. It’s like this weird thing with Game of Thrones, people going: “We want a different ending.” But sometimes the best ending isn’t an ending you want. You might not want the lead character to die, for example, but that’s still the best ending of the film. It’s interesting that people feel like they have the power to choose.What do most people in the street recognise you for?Hot Fuzz, bizarrely, because I think it’s shown on ITV so often. But I don’t get recognised generally. When you talk to taxi drivers or something, they go: “What have you been in?” So I list what I’ve been in, and they’re are like: “Nah, nah, nah.” If someone does recognise me, it’s actually quite nice, because I know they’re a fan of really obscure comedy. Then I’m like, OK, you’re a nerd like me, nice to meet you.How has comedy changed since you first started out?There are a lot more women around, which is brilliant, I remember going to Edinburgh 20 years ago and feeling like I was the only woman there. And I think comedy has become less fantastical: there’s less surrealism, which personally I quite miss. Things always go one way and then back again. So I think there’s room for a return to more craziness in comedy, more weirdness.

The chances are that, via Jack Nicholson in a Winnebago, Paul Giamatti in wine country and various instances of Tom Hanks rediscovering himself, it shouldn’t be too much of a challenge. Now try to think of the same number of equivalent female-led films. According to mainstream cinema, the middle-aged woman is a rarely sighted creature, like some timid, endangered gazelle who is camouflaged into near invisibility. Which is why, despite initial reservations about Chilean director Sebastián Lelio remaking his own film about a fiftysomething woman whose appetite for life, love and cheesy disco classics remains undimmed, I welcome this English-language version.Julianne Moore takes the title role in a remake that, while not quite shot for shot, is close enough for fans of the original to notice a subtle change in tone. This is a film with a softer embrace, a warmth and acceptance that is, in part, due to Lelio’s increased maturity as a film-maker but, mostly, is thanks to Moore’s engaged, generous work in the role. Her Gloria is a natural appeaser, who oils a sticky social situation – the birthday of her depressed adult son – with a nervous slick of small talk. But, it becomes increasingly clear, she is no pushover. If not a coming of age, the film is a “coming to terms” of sorts – a portrait of a woman who owns her bad decisions (John Turturro’s needily skittish orcee) and moves on to claim the happiness that is her right. Together with a soundtrack that blends quizzical motifs by Matthew Herbert and playfully employed MOR standards, which mark out the chapters in Gloria’s onoff romance, Moore’s subtle, empathetic work elevates what could be dismissed as a small-scale, even banal story."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ce36d395eedc4907ce92583d438b748352fa70b/0_0_3521_2112/master/3521.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a39db5d9eb52cb6999dba686e471466","title":"meera sodhas vegan recipe for baked pasta with sweet potato and miso","story":"With some minor prep, this simple summer lasagne almost makes itself – just layer it up and slide it into the ovenWhen June arrives, I want to be out of the kitchen as much as possible. That’s not to say I don’t cook, but I want to spend the least possible time in the kitchen, so I can make the most of the long evenings outside with my family and friends. All routes point towards dishes that require little to no prep, which to my mind means either salads or bung-it-in-the-oven dishes, such as this pasta bake. It takes 15 minutes to put together, and uses good, flavourful, pre-prepared ingredients such as miso, sun-dried tomato paste and passata. As a bonus, it feeds a crowd, too.Make sure that the non-dairy milk you use for the white sauce isn’t sweetened.750g sweet potato (ie, about 3), peeled and cut into 1cm-thick rounds Rapeseed oil Salt 1 x 680g bottle passata 150g sun-dried tomato paste ½ tsp kashmiri chilli powder 1 garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped2 tbsp brown miso750ml unsweetened non-dairy milk5 tbsp cornflour 250g wholewheat lasagne sheets 250g young spinach 75g panko breadcrumbsHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan)425Fgas 7.

Put the cornflour in a small bowl, stir in four tablespoons of the hot milk mixture to make a thin paste, then slowly whisk this back into the milk pan. Pop the pan back on a low heat for a few minutes, stirring until the sauce thickens to the consistency of custard, then season with a quarter-teaspoon of salt and turn off the heat.To build the lasagne, spread a ladleful of tomato sauce over the base of a 34cm roasting tray, then add a layer of lasagne sheets, followed by, in order, a third of the white sauce, half the spinach, half the sweet potato and half the tomato sauce.

Top with the last of the lasagne sheets and finish with final third of the white sauce.Scatter the breadcrumbs over the top and bake for 45-50 minutes, until the pasta is tender and the top bubbling and golden brown.

The attacking midfielder blessed with a bewitching left foot is still adjusting to the reality that her face beams down from a giant mural adorning the exterior of an Indian takeaway in her home town. “It’s a bit crazy,” she says. “Me and Claire Emslie were talking about murals the other day because she’s got one in Leith.”Through the windows of the team hotel lobby near the Promenade des Anglais, a warm, restorative sun dapples the hotel’s jasmine and bougainvillea-filled garden. All is outwardly serene but Scotland’s emotions as they enter their first World Cup finals and prepare for Sunday’s opener against England are rather more highly charged.“The attention we’re getting is a bit mad, a bit crazy,” says Weir. “But it’s something that hasn’t happened overnight and we’ve always wanted the country to get involved and be interested in women’s football so we’re embracing it.“It’s all gone to a new level and it’s not something I ever expected to happen when I was growing up in Dunfermline, but I feel very honoured. My dad spotted the mural a few days ago and sent me a picture. It’s near my old primary school, Pittencrieff, but it’s painted on the side of an Indian takeaway. It’s called the Royal Bengal and, to be fair, it’s quite popular, so I’ve been buzzing. I haven’t eaten there myself, but I’ve heard good reports.”Moreover, the mural appears to be bolstering local pride. “I’ve been getting supportive messages from people across Fife and I feel very honoured to be representing them in a small way,” says Weir. “But I don’t know what will happen to the image after the World Cup. I hope it’ll stay there for a little bit longer, but there’s a lot of rain in Dunfermline so maybe it’ll wash it off.”The Manchester City midfielder trusts Scotland’s progress under Kerr will prove rather less transient. “Tactically, Shelley’s very switched on,” says a 23-year-old who has modelled her game on those of Zinedine Zidane and Kelly Smith.“What’s great about this team is that we’re given a lot of freedom, it’s enjoyable and exciting to be part of. We try to build from the back and we want to play a nice brand of football. Sometimes we maybe put ourselves under a bit too much pressure, but we aim to play an attacking style and that’s the risk you take.”Scotland’s change under Kerr is such that Weir describes the difference between now and two years ago when they were thrashed 6-0 by England in the opening match of Euro 2017 as “a totally different ball game”.That defeat proved a salutary lesson. “It was a tough game, we learned a lot from it and we definitely don’t want a repeat,” says Weir. “We’ve now got a different manager, different tactics and people like Arsenal’s Kim Little available who weren’t fit for Euro 2017. The whole squad has also been training as full-time professionals for six months and we’re much stronger and more competitive.“It all makes you a lot more confident for Sunday. England are a top team and we’re not daft, but we’ve shown we can compete against some of the world’s best sides. We’ve got a gameplan hopefully we can execute it and, as a Scot, I don’t think there’s a better international match to win.”Should Weir clinch it courtesy of one of her trademark free-kicks, the Royal Bengal may have to be re-named Lady Caroline’s anyone?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3028f4824587c42279e97df2487cb2d7268604f/0_135_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f12054a958906fbae135f3f29a2d5c9","title":"norway v nigeria womens world cup 2019 live","story":"Three goals in 20 first-half minutes helped Norway ease past Nigeria in their Group A opener in Reims• Reiten steals show as Norway cruise to victoryRead Kieran Pender’s match report from Reims:Let’s recap the rest of the day two action:That was relatively plain-sailing from start to finish. Norway take victory from their Group A opener, moving level on points with hosts France, who sit top of the pile having found a fourth against Korea. The goalscorers Utland and Reiten were very influential for the Norwegians, particularly in a first-half blitz which brought all three goals, while the Nigeria goalkeeper Oluehi had a torrid time. 90+2 min: Oshoala carves out another opening for Nigeria, surging down the right flank before checking in at the byline. But Norway stand firm, with Minde and Thorisdottir stepping in to clean up. 90 min: There will be six added minutes. Reiten is withdrawn for Haavi, as Norway make their third and final change of the evening.89 min: Reiten runs into a Nigeria roadblock and requires a bit of treatment as a result. The time is ticking away. Norway are almost there.87 min: Graham hits it from 25 yards – but it is wayward.85 min: Thorsnes makes a superb, strong challenge to steal back possession just inside the Norway half. That is the catalyst for a swift upfield move, with Norway earning a free-kick soon after. Reiten and Graham are stood over it ...83 min: Graham goes on a mazy run for Norway, bouncing off four or five Nigeria defenders before letting fly inside the box. It is a relatively tame strike but it is enough to cause problems for the unconvincing Oluehi, who spills the ball, allowing it to slip through her fingers. Fortunately for Nigeria, the ball drops to safety, the wrong side of the post as far as Norway are concerned.82 min: Thorsnes has her first sighting of goal – but the Norway substitute fails to trouble the Nigeria goalkeeper. It was a slick move upfield by the Scandinavians, with the ball being swept in from the right flank. 79 min: Norway make their first change. Elise Thorsnes, the striker, replaces Utland in a like-for-like swap. Utland, who opened the scoring, is all smiles, high-fiving each member of the bench as he trods along the dugout. 75 min: Terrific arcing ball over the top of the Norway defence by Chikwelu – but Kanu, the substitute, cannot latch on to it. It was a wondrous pass but, in the end, that was about it, with Hjelmseth storming out of goal to greet the Nigeria forward. Nice idea. 72 min: Michael Essien, the former Ghana and Chelsea midfielder, is among those in the stands watching on. He is playing his football in Azerbaijan these days. There has not been too much to get excited about this second half. Norway are cruising.70 min: Ordega rounds Hjelmseth – but the striker cannot apply the finish! Another chance goes begging. Meanwhile Kanu is on for the captain Oparanozie.68 min: Oshoala stabs an effort at goal! Norway got sloppy in defence and Ordega and co worked the ball in from the right. It bobbled into the path of Oshoala, who had a couple of red shirts for company, but managed to steer the ball goalwards. In the end it is fairly comfortable for Hjelmseth. But they were momentarily panicked. There was a whiff of complacency about that.65 min: Norway are hardly fluent and Nigeria continue to plug away at them. Ordega remains a livewire for the African side. 61 min: Engen is grounded after a thumping – but good-natured – challenge by Chikwelu on halfway. Another short stoppage in Reims. Norway have not upped the ante since the break, but then again they seem quite happy in first gear.58 min: Chidinma Okeke, who starred for Nigeria in the Under-20 World Cup in France last year, raids down the left and draws the foul. Good play by the teenager. That will do her confidence the world of good. Nigeria end up winning another corner but Uchendu dragged wide from the edge of the box.55 min: Herlovsen shapes to shoot ... but Nigeria’s Ohale does superbly to get across and block. They eventually repel the resulting corner after dazzling footwork by the Norway No 10 Caroline Graham Hansen. 54 min: Oluehi punches the ball clear at the near post, with Herlovsen lurking. That stoppage appears to have further unsettled Nigeria.52 min: Michael is clearly in considerable pain. The Nigeria centre-back is carried off on a stretcher, with 18-year-old Chidinma Okeke on for her World Cup debut.50 min: With Michael still down, Nigeria make another, unrelated change: Halimatu Ayinde is withdrawn. Chinaza Uchendu races on in her place.49 min: Faith Michael is down injured after colliding with her own goalkeeper, Oluehi. The Nigeria medical team are on to offer some treatment while, down on the touchline, they are already readying a replacement. 47 min: Almost some early joy for Norway, who break through Herlovsen and Utland, who has been very lively. They fancy adding a fourth. Neither team opted to make changes at the interval.46 min: Norway get the second half started.Guro Reiten news, thanks to Ole Petter Pedersen, on email. “As it doesn’t seem to be mentioned, Reiten is joining Chelsea from Lillestrøm for £10.000, according to VG, Norway’s main news site. Her contract is up in December. She doesn’t like big cities and preferred townly Lillestrøm to Oslo when moving to the capital.”Half-time dispatch, courtesy of Kieran Pender:There is a buoyant atmosphere in Reims, notwithstanding the mainly empty upper-stands and the rout on the pitch. Reims is a notable French city in a number of ways: it’s the unofficial capital of the Champagne wine region, once hosted the coronation ceremonies for French kings, and - somewhat more relevantly for present purposes - is home to Stade de Reims (two-time European Cup runners-up). It’s also an unfortunate two-hour drive from where I am staying in Valenciennes tonight (where Australia face Italy tomorrow), so it’s going to be a late night for yours truly.Norway are very much in charge at the interval.45+2 min: Maren Mjelde fires the free-kick inches over Oluehi’s goal! A cracking effort – it was just a little too north by the Chelsea defender.45 min: There will be two added minutes, during which the first of which Norway have a very inviting free-kick on the edge of the 18-yard box. Ordega hauls down Utland, earning a booking in the process. Norway will fancy this ...43 min: And just as Nigeria look to keep up the heat on Norway, Ngozi Ebere passes the ball straight out of play.

His report has landed, and here it is. Meanwhile thanks for reading this MBM. Anon!The new boss Steve Clarke talks to Sky Sports, the metaphorical eyebrow raised. “It was interesting. A little bit different! I thought we did OK, we were comfortable at 1-0, but we switched off at a set play and that’s something you shouldn’t do at this level. But I thought the resilience and the character of the players to bounce back - because it would have been easy to feel sorry for yourself, but they didn’t - was a good sign. When you get such a late blow - and it wasn’t even a good header, it was poor marking, we’ll have a look at the video - they way they bounced back gives us good hope for the future. I’ve only been working with the group for seven training sessions, so it’s not going to change overnight. But I’ve given the lads a real amount of information. There are a lot of things to be pleased about, a lot of things to work on. We couldn’t afford to lose. We go to Belgium, everyone expects them to win, but it’s football, anything can happen.”And did you enjoy the game tonight? “No chance!”A very happy match-winner Oli Burke speaks! “It’s an amazing feeling to get my first Scotland goal. Credit to the boys, who were fantastic today. I’m really happy, and really happy for the team. Coming into a game like that, it’s made for me to make an impact, and conceding so late drove us a little bit more, pushed us for that next goal. And I think we deserved it.”Elsewhere, it was a 3-0 win for Belgium against Kazakhstan. Throw in Russia’s earlier 9-0 rout of San Marino, and the table, with all teams having played three times, reads:Scotland can go top if they beat Belgium next Tuesday, but let’s not get too carried away with the new Steve Clarke era just yet.Well that was exciting. Perhaps more exciting than Steve Clarke would have preferred, but it’s three points to the Scots. They were pushed all the way by Cyprus.90 min +5: Efrem’s free kick flies into the top right ... of the stand behind the goal. That’s a dismal effort, and surely Scotland are home and hosed now.90 min +4: It’s very shapeless. Suddenly Costi barges down the middle of the park and buys a cheap free kick off McLean, who really didn’t need to make a challenge. That’s a free kick, 30 yards out, just left of centre! A chance for Cyprus to salvage a point!90 min +2: Scotland draw a couple of fouls from Cyprus and the clock ticks on in their favour.90 min: Then another corner for Cyprus, which is just about dealt with by the Scots this time. There will be five added minutes of this gloriously messy nonsense!What a response by Scotland! Fraser dribbles down the left and hooks a fine cross into the centre. Burke gets up above Nicholas Ioannou and sends a downward header past Pardo ... but crashing off the inside of the right-hand post. But the ball rolls into the centre, where Burke converts into the empty net with glee! Hampden roars again!The corner’s hit long. Kousoulos, eight yards out and level with the far post, doesn’t have to jump off the ground to meet it with a header, and plants one into the right-hand side of the goal. None of the Scottish defenders covered themselves in glory there, to say the least. Penny for the thoughts of Steve Clarke, an assured defender himself.86 min: McGregor’s corner is plucked from the heavens by Pardo, who launches long for Georgiou. The sub forces the backtracking Robertson into the concession of a corner. From which ...85 min: Fraser makes up some ground on the left, then looks for the top right. No Robertson he, though it’s a decent enough curler that forces Pardo into tipping round the post for a corner.84 min: Scotland take the sting out of proceedings by taking an age over a throw in the professional style. Hampden is nervous.82 min: Hampden holds its breath as Margaca fires a deep cross in from the left. Kousoulos, coming in from the right, looks to have a clear header, ten yards out, but is blocked by his own man in Sotiriou. Artymatas tries to smash the rebound home from distance, but Marshall gathers. Sleepy Scotland were so close to giving it all away there.80 min: McGinn is replaced by McTominay. Then Makris makes way for Pittas.78 min: Fraser, out on the left, slips a pass down the inside-left channel for the underlapping O’Donnell, who draws Pardo and chips for goal. The ball bounces inches wide of the right-hand post. That would have been a picture-book goal.77 min: But Scotland’s lead is a slender one. Hampden are reminded of this when Makris has a dig from 25 yards. The ball pings off McKenna and nearly loops over Marshall, but the keeper tips over spectacularly. The resulting corner leads to nothing. But Cyprus were so close to a very fortunate equaliser there.76 min: A gorgeous bit of skill by Fraser, tight to the chalk out on the left. With little space to play with, or margin for error, he chips the ball down the line past Kousoulos and skedaddles towards the box. At which point he rather runs out of ideas, but that’s a fine run nonetheless.75 min: Artymatas is booked for excessively bothering McGregor. A free kick midway in Cypriot territory. Scotland rather conservatively play it backwards, professionalism rather than entertainment the watchword. See, this is where Uefa Multiball would come into its own.74 min: Burke comes on for the luckless Brophy, who hasn’t really had much chance to shine on his debut.72 min: Cyprus stroke the ball around in midfield for a while, the rhythm of the game having been disrupted by Spoljaric’s injury. For a while, there are two balls on the pitch. The referee doesn’t stop the game, perhaps under instruction from Uefa to trial a new multiball system. And you thought VAR was needless tinkering.70 min: Spoljaric has tweaked something, so he’s replaced by Costi.68 min: Scottish tails are up now. They’re passing it around with much more confidence. Cyprus by contrast are sitting back, hoping to weather the storm. What a difference a goal makes, is a cliche for a reason.66 min: The resulting corner ... you know how this goes by now. Once Cyprus clear their lines, they swap Michalis Ioannou for Georgiou.65 min: McGregor, to the right of the D, has a shot towards the bottom right. Pardo parries. He should gather, but spills the ball round the post. It was inches away from squirting into the net. The keeper got away with one there.64 min: McGinn sends a pass wide to Fraser, who is dribbling again with more purpose and intent, just as he did during the early stages of this match. He can’t quite break through on the edge of the area, but Cyprus were worried for a minute there.62 min: And there’s the Hampden Roar at last! The goal deserved nothing less. Robertson is a special player, and he’s being serenaded by the crowd accordingly.What a goal! McGinn, in a central position, slips the ball left to Robertson, who is racing towards it with extreme intent. He meets it first time, flush, sending a diagonal rising heat-seeker into the top right, Pardo with no chance whatsoever! A captain’s goal from a European champion. What a week he’s had!60 min: Sotiriou bustles down the left and wins a corner off O’Donnell. Another wasted set-piece will be along in a minute. And there it is. Scotland clear.59 min: McGregor passes the ball into touch while standing one yard from the white line, under no pressure whatsoever. A few addled Scottish heads right now as they hectically search for the breakthrough.57 min: Robertson’s cross from the left is swallowed hole by Pardo. Nobody in there challenging. On the touchline, Steve Clarke shows his first signs of concern.56 min: Fraser runs at the Cypriot back line, but loses confidence as he approaches the final third. The hosts need to up their game, quick-smart.54 min: And now a few whistles thrown in as Efrem earns a corner down the left. The set piece is claimed by Marshall. Scotland’s surge since the restart didn’t last long.52 min: Artymatas strides from the back like Beckenbauer, nobody bothering to close him down. He picks out Spoljaric upfield. Spoljaric races through a big gap between Mulgrew and McKenna, and sends a shot towards the bottom right. Marshall smothers, but the home faithful are getting worried. This second half had begun with a passionate, full-throated chorus of the Bonnie Banks o’ Loch Lomand. But that Hampden Increasingly Concerned Mutter’s back now.50 min: Sotiriou busies himself on the edge of the Scotland box, then sends a pass right for Makris, who fizzes a low one into the box. Fortunately for Scotland, it’s just behind Sotiriou, and the hosts clear.49 min: A positive run by Forrest down the right leads to a corner, which in turn leads to nothing. Pardo’s still to have his hands seriously warmed by Scotland.48 min: Added energy  good. Rushes of blood  bad. Fraser and Brophy work a little space down the left, the ball breaking back to Robertson, who must still be high on life after events in Madrid last Saturday. He smashes a very ambitious shot from distance miles over the bar.47 min: Roberson hoicks a long one down the left. McGregor gets on the end of it, and sends a huge up-and-under of a cross into the box. It’s easy pickings for Pardo. But it looks as though Scotland have been given the half-time rocket by their new manager, because there’s an early energy about them.We go again! Cyprus get the second half underway there have been no half-time changes.Half-time entertainment. Scotland’s women take on England tomorrow evening. Ahead of the big one, here’s Louise Taylor’s highly entertaining romp through the history of the women’s game, a tale that takes in outraged 17th-century ministers, the suffragettes, and some World Cup final hat-trick heroics that have nothing whatsoever to do with Geoff Hurst. (Also, the pictures from the 1971 Women’s World Cup in Mexico City are sensational.)Where’s Colin Stein when you need him?45 min: McGregor goes sliding into a 50-50 with Michalis Ioannou. He crumps his studs into his opponent’s knee, and is very fortunate just to see yellow. That was a poor challenge.44 min: McLean launches long down the inside-left channel. He’s very close to finding Fraser free, but there’s one too many joules of energy applied to the ball, and Pardo can come out and gather.43 min: Robertson picks up the pace and barrels down the inside-left channel. He slips a ball wide to Brophy, who enters the box, makes for the byline and crosses well. But the flag goes up for offside. Brophy had gone too early, though only just. Not much in that at all.41 min: And I bet this moment gave Robertson another sort of rush, as Sotiriou strides free down his flank and shoots diagonally, low and hard, towards the bottom left. Marshall does very well to paw the ball away as it threatens to worm its way into the corner. Scotland clear their lines, but that was close."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3a2b234148152cf8d0916efe54c9282aa38d7d4/260_77_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34cae1d1d1e3d0bba54dcef886ea3a2d","title":"true north in pursuit of balance and better buses in the guardians manchester office","story":"Our North of England editor Helen Pidd explains why she wanted to launch our ‘London versus’ series, shining a light on a national ideIt was a grumpy bus journey to Stockport that prompted the ’s recent London Versus series. Peeved at having to pay £3.50 to go a few short miles into town, I tweeted a picture of my ticket and pointed out that the same journey would have cost £1.50 in London.Thousands of people responded with their own bus woes: hotel workers on minimum wage in the Lake District, where a single from Ambleside to Grasmere is £5.65 a carer from County Durham, where fares seem inversely proportionate to local earnings someone in Oldham whose route was served by one bus company until teatime and another later on, necessitating the purchase of an extra-expensive “all services” day ticket if he returned after dark.When I moved up to Manchester from London in 2013 to become the ’s North of England editor, it soon became clear that public transport was the great ider between the capital and everywhere else.I’d been spoilt in London. By the time I left, London Overground had been revamped, the £17.6bn Crossrail was under way and Boris Johnson had spent hundreds of millions on a new fleet of Routemaster buses. Coming back to my native north after 14 years away, transport had gone in reverse. It seemed the logical starting point for a series which aimed to explore how much the rest of England has been left behind as London has pulled away.The debate about regional imbalance is often framed as north v south. But for me it is London which – certainly in respect of transport, culture and political representation – gets a plum deal at the expense of the rest of England. Pick any seaside town on the south coast and it will have the same issues of deprivation and poverty as Morecambe Bay, where I grew up in England’s north-west.That’s not to say Londoners are all living a life of luxury. The oligarchs who have bought up Mayfair in a rouble- and riyal-fuelled game of Monopoly may be, but for many residents, who pay through the nose for substandard accommodation and suffer long and undignified commutes, just existing in London can be a struggle. Nonetheless, I hear the same complaints wherever I go, from Redcar to Blackpool, Scunthorpe to Crewe: Britain is still disproportionately centralised in terms of institutions and power, and it can be a real struggle for the media to attempt to counteract that with their coverage at a national level.Most newspapers today are based in London (with the exception of the Sunday Sport). It wasn’t always thus. The Express had a substantial presence in Manchester for decades – its splendid art deco outpost is currently being converted into newspaper-themed offices. And for the first 143 years of our existence, Manchester was also the ’s home – a fact of which we are extremely proud. The original wooden sign that hung over the entrance to our early Manchester offices is now displayed near the entrance to our London base.We didn’t need a northern editor until 1964, when the then editor-in-chief, Alastair Hetherington, moved from Manchester to London, taking with him large numbers of editorial staff. The paper had dropped “Manchester” from the masthead five years earlier, in 1959, and circulation figures had taken a nosee in the northern heartlands.Paddy Monkhouse was the first appointee, tasked with keeping readers loyal in England’s upper half while providing news and features that would resonate among our burgeoning southern readership. He died in 1981 and his obituary describes him as “a devoted northerner who opposed what he took to be the editor’s policy of preferring Prague to Bolton as far as news was concerned”.I am the eighth holder of the position and the first woman, heading up a small but mighty office on Deansgate in central Manchester. Notable predecessors included Brian Redhead, who went on to become an institution on the BBC’s Today programme John Course, who kept a labrador under his desk and wore sandals in all weathers Harry Whewell, who could have been a top executive in London but refused to leave his roots, according to former editor-in-chief Peter Preston and the ever cheerful and often whimsical Martin Wainwright, who became a true ambassador for the north during his 18-year reign.I’m often asked if the  has a southern editor. The answer is no. Philippa Mole, our excellent archivist, has found no records of such a position, even in the Manchester  days, when the London office was but a satellite. (There was, however, a London editor from at least 1902, sometimes referred to as the “London manager”.)In the last three years, we have markedly increased not just our coverage of the north, but the size of the office, and today we have more people in the north than most British news organisations. The  and the Times, the ’s main domestic competitors in what was once the broadsheet market, currently have no dedicated northern correspondents in the north of England. The FT has two, the Daily Mail five. We have three general reporters based in Manchester – me, Josh Halliday and Nazia Parveen – plus Eric Allison, our long-serving prisons correspondent. In July Maya Wolfe-Robinson moves up from the opinion desk in London and will take on a reporting role. Meanwhile, our colleagues in London on the arts, business and opinion desks incorporate northern issues into their work as often as is feasible.A certain chippiness comes with being a professional northerner. Just as Monkhouse grumbled that the newsdesk was more interested in eastern Europe than east Lancashire, so too have I been known to complain that we cover the machinations of Capitol Hill in far more detail than any English town hall. There is still much work to be done, but thankfully we are making headway, and our sizeable northern readership reflects this. Later this month, we will host a number of events in Manchester marking the 200th anniversary of the Peterloo massacre, which led to the founding of the Manchester .There are readers who only want us to write about the north’s sunny side, perhaps mistaking us for the North of England Tourist Board. But we try hard not to just focus on the negatives: recent articles have profiled the Teesside prison teaching coding to inmates, visited the Oldham school combating ethnic segregation and explored how devolved services in Manchester are far better at getting the long-term unemployed back into work than the Department for Work and Pensions in London.As London becomes ever more unaffordable I suspect more journalistic refugees may flee the capital. Ultimately, it would be wonderful if the north of England one day had a number of reporters proportional to its population, which at 14.9m is roughly half the size of the south. A better life and a varied reporting diet awaits – they’ll just need a bit more change for the bus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ace827823da61c96ca61870b635f98b24878b76/0_203_2997_1798/master/2997.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7463a82175d32e112443e075a757a2d9","title":"china other tiananmens podcast","story":"Hundreds of Chinese cities were involved in the student-led demos in 1989. ’s Lily Kuo discusses the uprisings outside of Beijing.

He remains an MP, but if his application for readoption is rejected he may face challenges from other candidates for the seat.In a statement posted on Twitter, the Beaconsfield constituency Conservative Association chairman, Jackson Ng, said: “I understand that there are feelings of disappointment, anger and frustration from many of our membership.“Therefore, following this evening’s special general meeting and on behalf of our executive council, I have immediately written to our MP, Dominic Grieve QC, to formally request that he now submits a written application to us to seek his readoption as our parliamentary candidate for the next general election expected in 2022.”Should Grieve apply, his case will be decided in a secret ballot of members of the local executive.One local party member, Dylan Kenny, said on Twitter: “It was heartening that everyone spoke respectfully and with dignity. Dominic made an impassioned and highly intelligent speech. I am glad there was no animosity and the association should be proud of the conduct of this evening’s discourse.”Grieve has long been the symbol of the internal battle within the Tory party over Brexit. He has previously called for a second referendum and has campaigned against leaving the EU without a deal.He was an outspoken critic of Theresa May’s handling of the Brexit negotiations and told the party in March that he had never felt more ashamed to be a Conservative.After losing the local confidence vote in March, he said he was then subject of “an orchestrated and organised campaign” by Brexiters to deselect him. The push for his deselection has been led by the former Ukip candidate Jon Conway, whom the Conservatives recruited after serving as a regional organiser for Vote Leave.The justice secretary, David Gauke, is also facing a no-confidence vote over his Brexit stance.

It isn’t our job this time to start anything. We already did that.”Overtures by the Greens to the Lib Dems and Labour before the 2017 election to avoid splitting the anti-Conservative vote through constituency-based pacts came to nothing, and a similar idea for the European elections last month fell foul of what Bartley called “game playing”.He said of any future deal: “On any issue where there’s common ground, we’re always willing to have a conversation. But at the same time, it’s going to have to be a very robust conversation. We are offering something very different.”The party has had a successful few months, thanks to a combination of some remain-minded supporters abandoning Labour, greater public awareness of environmental issues following the Extinction Rebellion protests, and the spread of ideas the party has championed, such as a four-day working week and a “green new deal”.The co-leaders said the surge was also the result of many years of patient organising at a local level, building up what Bartley called a “network of field organisers”.Berry said: “When the local election results came in, every time it was, ‘Yes, I’ve been there, Jonathan’s been there, I recognise those people, I know why they won.’ It wasn’t a protest vote, a flash in the pan, a single issue. It was our hard work all year round that’s leading to the results.”The conference this weekend in Scarborough will feature a celebration of recent successes, but also new policy proposals, including a formal endorsement of the global climate strike – a planned series of protests in September – spearheaded by the teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.Other initiatives will be new ways to measure the strength of the economy and transport policies based around the £50bn-plus saved by scrapping HS2.Bartley said: “We think it’s time to pull the plug on the project and put that money into the rail revolution that we need – cross-country and city links, getting more freight on to rail, electrifying lines, plus new bus routes for rural communities.“And to find an alternative to short-haul flights, to get people out of their cars. If we’re going to make this move to a zero-carbon economy, we’re going to have to think very differently about this infrastructure. And we’re the only party putting forward this programme.”While much recent coverage of politics beyond the established parties has focused on the Brexit party – which is topping Westminster polls, in which the Greens are fifth – Berry and Bartley said the rise of Nigel Farage’s party presents an opportunity.“We’re the antidote to the Brexit party,” Bartley said. “We’re the party that hasn’t compromised. And all the other parties have compromised.“There’s an issue of trust. A lot of Labour voters came to us in the European elections because they were disappointed in Labour’s position on Brexit, and didn’t trust the Lib Dems because of their record.”If some of these switching voters backed the Greens in the local and European elections, it could become a habit, he argued: “Just going back three months, we knew that this could happen, but we were in a very different position. And this is the nature of politics now, you just do not know what is round the corner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d791f825a9135f086a1c1c119a3db0421185297/1171_0_3201_1920/master/3201.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29b44d96ce54b366e6061dd617881f31","title":"jeremy corbyn to drop social mobility as labour goal","story":"Party leader says idea has failed and calls instead for social justice commissionJeremy Corbyn is dropping the idea of social mobility as a goal for the next Labour government, saying he would instead create a “social justice commission” with the power to audit policy.In a shift being billed by Labour strategists as the rejection of 40 years of political consensus, Corbyn said on Saturday that pursuing social mobility “has failed, even on its own terms”.Speaking at a Labour education event in Birmingham, the party leader vowed to replace the idea that the brightest, most talented young people must have the opportunity to succeed, with a demand that all children be allowed to flourish.“For decades we’ve been told that inequality doesn’t matter because the education system will allow talented and hard-working people to succeed whatever their background. But the greater inequality has become, the more entrenched it has become,” he is expected to say.“The idea that only a few talented or lucky people deserve to escape the disadvantage they were born into, leaving in place a social hierarchy in which millions are consigned to the scrap heap, results in the talents of millions of children being squandered.”Labour would replace the social mobility commission, which is chaired by Dame Martina Milburn, with a social justice commission, the party said.The watchdog would publish “social justice impact assessments” of government policies – including green papers, white papers and legislation. It would also publish advice to ministers about how best to pursue social justice.Responding to questions about what a social justice commission would do that a social mobility commission has not, Corbyn said: “It’s going to make sure that we get an education system that makes sure all of our children achieve their best in school.“The idea of social mobility where you pluck somebody out of poverty and promote them into a private school education or promote them somewhere else doesn’t actually help the majority. What we have is a lot of under-used talent in society.“A social justice commission will be there to make proposals, ask very tough questions of government and will measure our government against the improvements in social mobility for the entire population, not just the few.”Corbyn’s move is the latest evidence of his team’s determination to reshape Labour – and underlines his belief that the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown governments did not do enough to shake up the economic system.Enhancing social mobility has been the aim of governments on both sides of the political ide. Blair’s close ally Peter Mandelson memorably said he was “intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich as long as they pay their taxes” – though he has since admitted he has become more concerned about inequality.Labour is keen to show that its thinking has developed since Corbyn and his advisers drew up the 2017 general election manifesto.Theresa May made it her goal shortly after becoming prime minister to create a “great meritocracy” in Britain, not least by expanding grammar schools – a policy that was quietly dropped after the Tories lost their majority in 2017.At the Birmingham event the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: “Focusing only on a lucky few leaves inequality entrenched and those from disadvantaged backgrounds with few opportunities to get on. That was the damning verdict of the government’s own social mobility commission, which Tory ministers have shamefully ignored.”She embraced the legacy of past Labour governments, saying: “The Tories like to talk about people like me who had a difficult start but got on in life as evidence that anyone can succeed on their own. But actually my life shows the exact opposite.

He said that if chosen as Tory leader he would return to Brussels with a “best, final offer” - including the removal of the Irish backstop – but insist there could be no further delay, and that the UK would be prepared to leave without a deal.As she announced on 24 May, Theresa May will step down formally as Conservative leader on Friday although she will remain in place as prime minister until her successor is chosen.The rules for the contest to replace her have been tweaked by the backbench 1922 Committee, with the backing of the party’s board, in order to prevent the contest dragging on for weeks.Nominations will close at 5.30pm next Monday. Candidates will have to show that they have the support of eight of their colleagues: a proposer, a seconder and six other MPs.MPs will hold a series of votes, in order to narrow down the crowded field, which currently stands at eleven leadership hopefuls.How does the voting work?MPs choose one candidate, in a secret ballot held in a committee room in the House of Commons. The votes are tallied and the results announced on the same day.The 1922 Committee has decided that after the first round, any candidate who wins the support of less than 17 MPs, will be eliminated. And after the second round, the threshold will be set at 33 MPs.Rounds of voting will then continue until just two candidates remain. The first round will be held on Thursday 13 June from 10am to noon. Subsequent rounds have been pencilled in for the 18th, 19th and 20th.The two remaining candidates will then be put to the Conservative membership for a vote.When will the results be announced?Once MPs have whittled down the field to two, Conservative party HQ takes over the running of the next stage, which it says will be completed in the week beginning Monday 22 July.Will there be hustings?Yes: MPs have organised a series of events themselves to put the candidates through their paces, kicking off with an event convened by the One Nation group on Tuesday evening. Conservative party HQ will organise its own events and the BBC has also announced several televised debates between the candidates.“It’s a test of nerve here and if candidates cannot stand up their resolve to lead us out by the end of October in a leadership contest, what chance would they have under the heat of the negotiations in Brussels?”Raab said the Peterborough byelection, in which the Tories finished third, and the party’s drubbing in the European election, showed it was “devastating for the Conservatives if we don’t keep our promises on Brexit”.He said: “What we can’t have is this paralysing uncertainty, bad for the economy, bad for trust in democracy, bad for the Conservatives – as we are seeing – of just going on and on with this prolonged torture of haggling with the EU when we haven’t got a deal in sight.”The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, said on Thursday that it was “blindingly obvious” the new Conservative prime minister would not be able to suspend parliament to push through a no-deal Brexit.“That is simply not going to happen. It is just so blindingly obvious that it almost doesn’t need to be stated, but apparently, it does and therefore I have done,” he told MPs.Following Theresa May’s formal resignation as Tory leader on Friday, the starting gun has been fired in the race to succeed her. The nomination process will take place on Monday, with candidates requiring eight MPs to back them in order to enter the race, with the first round of voting on Thursday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be001f5f5b7cee4fc70205446e8f4fa4faea03c8/18_98_2168_1300/master/2168.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c143e60fc0691b0e63edeaceda315102","title":"thornberry may face reshuffle after labour split on new brexit vote","story":"Jeremy Corbyn and his inner circle are considering a frontbench reshuffle that could see the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, moved as a punishment for insisting that the party must back a second Brexit referendum, according to several senior figures in the party.There is also growing support from some of Corbyn’s allies, including union leaders close to the leader’s office, for a new contest to be held that could see Tom Watson replaced as deputy leader, following his persistent backing for a public vote on the UK’s exit from the EU.Sources inside Corbyn’s office said last night that there were “all sorts of mischievous rumours” being put about, but did not confirm – or rule out – imminent changes to the party’s top team. “They are very angry with Emily and are out to get Tom,” said one shadow cabinet source. “That has been incredibly obvious over recent days.” Another senior source said: “There is talk of petitions going round local parties, particularly to rally support for a deputy leadership contest. This would require more than 50 MPs to back it to get off the ground. They may want to do it, but it almost certainly won’t work.”Thornberry was humiliated last week when Corbyn’s office decided to ditch her as the stand-in at prime minister’s questions in favour of shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, who is a close ally of both Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell.The decision was taken, according to insiders, because Thornberry had blamed the party’s poor showing in the European elections on its ambiguous position over a second referendum and called on the party to give unequivocal backing to a second vote in which the party would campaign for Remain. One idea being floated by Corbyn supporters, say sources, is that Thornberry should swap positions with the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, to help ensure that Thornberry is removed from direct involvement in strategy around Brexit. “They have been trying to do this for weeks, but Diane refuses to move,” said one senior MP.Shadow ministers also believe that some in Corbyn’s office want to remove Keir Starmer as shadow Brexit secretary, because he had led calls for the party to back a second referendum. But it is thought Corbyn is unlikely to risk a move which MPs believe could lead to Starmer’s resignation.Pressure for a contest to select a new deputy has come from Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union and an ally of Corbyn. He is understood to have the backing of Unite’s general secretary, Len McCluskey.There was intense relief at the top of the party on Friday morning when Labour narrowly retained the marginal seat of Peterborough, seeing off a challenge by Nigel Farage’s Brexit party. Labour’s candidate, Lisa Forbes, won 10,484 votes, beating the Brexit party candidate, Mike Greene, by 683 votes. The Conservatives were beaten into third place.Corbyn is expected to address the parliamentary Labour party tomorrow about Labour’s performance in the European elections, which saw it lose half its seats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab309586e55bd02f5ee85455752643cf5918b5e/0_2614_3370_2021/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28f1928947d8c7bea65c453b3c93bace","title":"share your experiences of sure start childrens centres","story":"Whether you helped set up the programme in your area or your family used a centre near you, we would like to hear your storiesThe flagship Sure Start programme has saved the NHS millions of pounds through the benefits it has brought to children including some of the most deprived areas and reducing the number of those taken to hospital, according to a study.Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies “found that where Sure Start offered high levels of service in poor neighbourhoods in England, visits to hospital to treat injuries fell among all children of primary school age, and by a third of all 11-year-olds”.Tracy Brabin, the shadow early years minister, said: “This research shows the critical role Sure Start plays in children’s health, as well as their development.

On a day when sunshine contended with squally showers, and Taunton hosted its first men’s ODI in 20 years, the Quantocks felt like the perfect rural backdrop for some over-optimistic batting – against a Kiwi attack that will certainly test more mature technique this tournament.Aftab Alam – he of the 80s headband – took three wickets in the Kiwi reply, and there was another touch of eccentricity to proceedings as Martin Guptill looped an inside edge to backward point off the very first ball of their innings. He walked off the field smiling, sensing, perhaps, that this was a day for humorous happenings, rather than tragic ones. In the end, New Zealand made the 173 they needed in only 32.1 overs.This was entertainment of the holiday kind, to be bracketed alongside the guy shredding on his electric cricket-bat guitar, or the volunteer juggling foam bats for kids behind the Ondaatje pavilion. At one stage, Gulbadin Naib’s men had lost four wickets for four runs, flinging the willow with an abandon as joyous as it was misguided. Only Hashmatullah Shahidi’s 59 showed any serious bent.James Neesham, meanwhile, picked up five wickets for 31, the best figures of the World Cup so far, not to mention of his own professional career. He had talked candidly, in the run-up to this World Cup, of how close he came to quitting the game entirely in recent years. Dropped from the squad after the 2017 Champions Trophy, Neesham found himself trapped in a downward spiral, bitter and angry whenever he took to the field. It took 18 months – and some psychological counselling – to rediscover the pleasure in playing.He has let go of his crippling perfectionism, and his role since his return in January has been one of support rather than stardom. His batting has only been needed three times in their last seven one-day games, and in his side’s otherwise miserly bowling performance against Bangladesh, his two overs of medium pace shed 24 runs. At Taunton, where his run-up almost seemed to begin at the sightscreen, he found extra rhythm and pace. “It was a different surface and perhaps suited him a little more, someone who runs in and hits the wicket hard,” his captain Kane Williamson mused. “He bowled some beautiful deliveries today.”Neesham was helped in no small part by Lockie Ferguson’s thunderbolts at the other end. One of Ferguson’s four wickets was Rashid Khan, bowled when a nasty length ball ricocheted off his helmet. Rashid was sent for concussion tests and played no further part in the game, although the good news for Afghanistan was that he was not expected to need treatment.There was a glorious glimpse, at the start of the match, of Afghanistan’s best side. Hazratullah came out swinging in the most literal sense: he took three consecutive fours off Matt Henry’s first over. Sometimes his hitting was art – a whip to fine leg off Ferguson’s first ball – and sometimes it was agriculture. Hoicking to deep-midwicket, he sent Colin de Grandhomme and Martin Guptill off on a collision course, as both men failed to reach the ball. Two balls later, he had three fielders converging on the same spot. They still all missed it.At the other end, Noor Ali was unrolling deliciously wristy shots both sides of the wicket, and within 11 overs they had put together their team’s second highest partnership of the tournament. But Hazratullah’s dismissal, caught at backward point, contained a terrible inevitability, and by the time captain Gulbadin was out – struggling so hard to reach the ball that he was the last to realise he had edged it – Afghanistan had toppled from 66-0 to 70 for four.Afghanistan’s batting has born a certain naivety throughout this World Cup – unsurprising given that many players have grown up with the six-and-out mentality of 10-over games. But it is an issue they will have to address if they aim to be in international cricket for a long time. It is possible that, arriving in England as everyone’s favourite second team, the players’ self-estimation has been raised unhelpfully high.The expectations of their own fans have brought its own kind of pressure, and some team members have not learned that engaging with them on social media is not always healthy or necessary.“If you play this kind of cricket you should play 50 overs,” was Gulbadin’s post-game verdict. “If you’re losing games, it’s really difficult in the dressing room, but I know my team-mates. We’re not losing one-sided matches. The morale is still high for the boys. We just need one good match.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10cfae36f36053ab14964ae43b78c5107c8eaf6f/0_280_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05b63b7a7572093b76e69ac4b6354028","title":"england bangladesh cricket world cup match report","story":"• England 386-6 Bangladesh 280. England win by 106 runs• Opener smashes 153 from 121 ballsJason Roy is no longer out of sorts. At Trent Bridge against Pakistan he had a bit of a nightmare, dropping a straightforward catch and missing an early sweep. But in Cardiff he was back to his best, hitting 153 from 121 balls, his ninth ODI century, which dictated the outcome of the match that England won by 106 runs. And for good measure Roy held a fine ing catch to break Bangladesh’s best partnership.Roy’s innings was responsible for the first monumental score of the tournament, 386 for six. Bangladesh chased valiantly with Shakib Al Hasan, who is having a superb tournament, hitting a wonderfully resolute and resourceful century. But a record run chase in World Cup history was way beyond them that landmark still resides with Ireland in Bengalaru against England in 2011.So England are relieved to be back on course after a copybook batting display and a competent one from the bowlers, with Jofra Archer outstanding especially in his first spell. Effortless pace dismissed Soumya Sarkar and disturbed the others. Next stop for Morgan’s team is Southampton, where they meet West Indies on Friday. For Bangladesh there was no disgrace in this defeat. They battled hard throughout but were outgunned on a ground where it can be so hard to defend, particularly when the pitch is so conducive to strokeplay.At the start Roy and Jonny Bairstow demonstrated the virtues of displaying a little more discretion at the start of the innings. Bangladesh adopted the ploy, successful in England’s first two games, of opening with a spinner, Shakib. This time the opening pair tried nothing extravagant against the slow bowler but it would not matter that Shakib yielded only two runs in his first two overs.Roy was timing the ball sweetly from the start while Bairstow was more tentative and for a while he could not quite hide his edginess. But before long the runs were flowing. Mashrafe Mortaza decided to open the bowling himself alongside Shakib rather than tossing the ball to Mustafizur Rahman, which would have been a more positive option. On this track, which possessed some live grass, early wickets were essential. That grass created pace rather than movement, which would prove appetizing for the batsmen.Moreover, a strong breeze would prove an impediment in the field. Those who drew the short straw were obliged to run in from the River Taff End with the ominous realisation that a mishit could clear the straight boundary. In fact Mortaza, by taking the obvious course at the toss, had probably done Eoin Morgan and his side a great favour when he decided to bowl first. No one has chased more than 328 in a World Cup match.The openers had posted 128 inside 20 overs when Bairstow was superbly held at extra cover by Mehidy Hasan at extra cover. Joe Root then supported Roy modestly in a 77-run union before being bowled off the inside edge. His departure may have enhanced the problems of Mortaza, the Bangladesh captain, since Jos Buttler was now promoted to No 4.Roy reached his hundred in 92 balls, his ninth in ODI cricket, and then accelerated. He had time to hit a double hundred but was probably seduced in the 35th over, which was bowled by Hasan, the off-spinner. The problem for Roy was that he hit the first three balls for six, all massive strikes into the wind and into the stands, which were now packed. Now he may have felt duty bound to carry on regardless. Hasan bowled a little wider and quicker and Roy swung. This time the ball spewed in the air and Mortaza at extra cover, like the good desperate captain that he is, made sure that he hung on to a ball that was swirling in the breeze.But Buttler was still there to torment Mortaza though soon he was limping, which was later revealed to be caused by a hip problem that kept him off the pitch later. Bairstow was an eager, highly competent replacement behind the stumps. With a stream of powerful orthodox drives Buttler struck 64 from 44 balls. He is vital to England’s cause so he will now be anxiously nursed between matches. If necessary he might play without keeping wicket to reduce the strain on his body. Chris Woakes and Liam Plunkett cracked 47 in less than four overs at the end to ensure the most formidable of totals.Archer made Bangladesh’s task even more daunting with his opening spell Tamim Iqbal never ignited but Mushfiqur Rahim, impish as ever, joined forces with Shakib in a partnership of 133. Mushfiqur’s departure, immediately followed by that of Mohammad Mithun, meant that any English tension now evaporated despite the heroics of Shakib. Adil Rashid, preferred to Moeen Ali at what England considered a one-spinner venue, was responsible for Mithun’s dismissal as a consequence his confidence flooded back. This selection was convenient for Moeen, who was not at the ground because of the imminent arrival of his second child, one of the boons of his side hosting the tournament.Ben Stokes and Archer mopped up the tail without too much bother despite the zing bails failing to fall to the ground once again when tapped by the ball. By then it did not matter and Stokes broke into a broad smile - as did most of the England players at the end of a comfortable victory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1447294247ef45406dcecce6a9cff66559a43932/0_157_5204_3122/master/5204.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c69dd47fcd85c2b41db41e5b3653f35a","title":"sebastian vettel snatches dramatic canadian gp pole from lewis hamilton","story":"A long time coming, Sebastian Vettel was finally able to climb from his car and revel in once more being at the front of the grid after he took pole position for the Canadian Grand Prix. Vettel was understandably emotional, buzzing on his achievement and no doubt some relief that he had finally beaten Lewis Hamilton into second.The German’s championship hopes had been slipping away with Ferrari seemingly powerless in the face of the Mercedes juggernaut this season, but pole in Montreal is a lifeline for Vettel and the Scuderia.Vettel put in a stunning lap at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve to pip Hamilton for the top spot at Sunday’s 50th Canadian Grand Prix. In what was expected to be a tight fight at the front he had to pull out an inch-perfect run on his final lap and was ecstatic at claiming pole for the first time this year. His teammate Charles Leclerc was in third with Daniel Ricciardo making the best of his chance to take fourth for Renault. Red Bull’s Pierre Gasly was in fifth.Ferrari have yet to win this year and a beaming Vettel admitted it was just what was needed after a tough opening to the season. “I’m full of adrenaline,” he said. “The feeling in the car when it just keeps coming and the feeling – it felt so good. I enjoyed it and I’m very happy and happy for the team. Over the last few races, it’s been very tough.”This is only Ferrari’s second pole of the year and their principal, Mattia Binotto, reflected Vettel’s relief. “We’re very happy,” he said. “I think it has been a positive surprise for us as well.”Vettel had to be at his best in Montreal, making the most of the minor advantage Ferrari have enjoyed all weekend. Hamilton was quickest on his first hot run in Q3 with a time of 1min 10.493 sec, almost two-tenths clear of Vettel. However on their last laps Vettel pulled out all the stops and with a time of 1:10.24 left Hamilton, who made a mistake at the hairpin on his last lap, in his wake, two-tenths down. Hamilton acknowledged he could not match his rival. “I don’t feel disappointment,” he said. “We gave it everything I had got. They were faster and in the last sector they were killing us.”This is Vettel’s 56th career pole position and is finally the return to form he would have wanted from Ferrari. It is his first for 17 races, the last coming in Germany in 2018.Having done so he will be hoping to exert calm control from the front and make an inroad into the 55 points by which he trails Hamilton in the championship. He and Ferrari badly need to begin hauling Mercedes back and if Vettel can take his first win since the Belgian Grand Prix last year it will just keep their title hopes alive.Qualifying had been far from a forgone conclusion and was perhaps the hardest to call all season. Mercedes brought their first new engine upgrade to Canada and were optimistic it would represent a step forward indeed, Ferrari believed Mercedes still had the advantage. However, on a track where Ferrari’s straight-line speed and low drag was expected to favour the Scuderia, Vettel made the most of it.His team had employed a new turbo and MGU-H energy recovery system and hoped to rediscover the form with which they had looked so strong in testing. In Canada at least they have once again found the balance and grip in their car. Working the tyres to the right temperature has proved crucial and they found the sweet spot here.The real business is yet to come but Vettel has excellent form in Canada. This is his fifth pole here and his second in a row, having also taken the top spot which he converted to victory last year. He also won for Red Bull in 2013 and starting from the front, he will be optimistic of claiming his first victory this season and finally ending the Mercedes hegemony.Kevin Magnussen crashed his Haas in Q2, ending the session while Max Verstappen was on his final lap and leaving the Dutchman unable to finish. Red Bull had put him out on the medium tyres for his first run but it proved costly. He was knocked out in 11th place, while Magnussen finished in 10th.Valtteri Bottas had a poor Q3, spinning once he finished in sixth. Nico Hülkenberg was in seventh for Renault. Lando Norris and Carlos Sainz were in eighth and ninth for McLaren, but Sainz will take a three-place grid penalty for blocking Alexander Albon.Daniil Kvyat and Albon were in 12th and 14th for Toro Rosso. The Haas of Romain Grosjean was in 15th and Antonio Giovinazzi was in 13th for Alfa Romeo. His teammate Kimi Raikkonen was in 17th. Sergio Pérez and Lance Stroll were in 16th and 18th for Racing Point. The Williams of George Russell and Robert Kubica were in 19th and 20th."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e831240659a096031ddf3525f59ffa3063dfe7be/0_96_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=005513cb18c535ed98608116c441a677","title":"send tip uk river canal walk win 200 hotel voucher","story":"Full of nature, history and great pubs, our towpaths are fabulous places to walk.

With its 360-degree panoramic view from the top floor, the museum has always been on a mission: to let the world know that this is the most appropriate place to exhibit the marbles that once adorned the Periclean masterpiece.But a decade after it opened, the four-storey edifice at the foot of the Acropolis is now focusing on the lives of ancient Greeks. As the museum prepares to celebrate its 10th birthday on 20 June, it has announced the opening of a new exhibition space: an entire excavated neighbourhood of ancient villas, streets, workshops and bathhouses that lies below the museum building.On Friday, as archaeologists put the finishing touches to the site, Dimitrios Pandermalis, the museum’s director, told how finds once considered a curse had become a blessing. “For the first time we are able to see how people lived in the shadow of the Acropolis,” he enthused, singling out an ornate ancient courtyard and a chamber where aristocrats had held symposiums.“And through the display of discoveries such as plates and toys, visitors will have a glimpse into the daily lives of ancient Greeks. There are a lot of marble masterpieces on display around the museum but life is not only about the glory days of yesteryear it is about little things that make each and every day.”The building of a €130m museum so close to the Acropolis, and on a site so rich in archaeology, was not without controversy. The discovery of ruins dating from the late classical era – in the fifth century BC – to the early Byzantine period in the 12th century AD delayed building work.But the 13 years of digging paid off. One of the biggest excavations within the walls of ancient Athens helped archaeologists learn more than any previous dig had about the birthplace of democracy. “It was complex because there were so many layers, so many dwellings, one on top of the other, all telling the history of Athens,” said Stamatia Eleftheratou, who headed the excavation work.The ancient settlement covers 4,000 square metres, accessed by steel walkways. But Eleftheratou and her team worked over an area three times that size, discovering close to 50,000 artefacts, including figurines of little-known deities. “There is an entire hidden layer, earlier ruins beneath the settlement that aren’t visible because we covered them again with earth,” she said.Pandermalis said some of the treasures will also be on show in the exhibition space. A Roman-era copy of an original 4th century BC marble bust of Aristotle is likely to have pride of place when the artefacts go on display next year.With its aquiline nose, protruding forehead and minute eyes and mouth, the bust is considered one of the best likenesses of the Greek philosopher. “He is well-groomed and well dressed,” smiled Pandermalis, saying the piece had been discovered by chance amid the debris of an archaeological trench.“It is the image of a man who took great care of himself and that is fitting as we know, unlike other philosophers, Aristotle did indeed care about such things.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05ec3b977db511bf011eb19267c7fc278df13de9/0_12_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91570b6d2bac8f5313013347e94c8b3c","title":"us ambassador israel david friedman west bank annexation","story":"The US ambassador to Israel did not rule out an Israeli move to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, land the Palestinians seek for a state, in an interview with the New York Times published on Saturday.Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in the run-up to an April election that he plans to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank, a move bound to trigger widespread international condemnation and complicate peace efforts.The Times said US ambassador David Friedman declined to say how Washington would respond to annexation, but remarked: “We really don’t have a view until we understand how much, on what terms, why does it make sense, why is it good for Israel, why is it good for the region, why does it not create more problems than it solves.“These are all things that we’d want to understand, and I don’t want to prejudge.”The White House has been working on a proposal for peace between Israel and the Palestinians, dubbed by Donald Trump “the deal of the century”. It has not disclosed any of its details. In an interview with Axios last week White House adviser Jared Kushner cast doubt on Palestinian abilities to self-govern.Most countries view Israeli settlements in the West Bank, territory captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, as illegal. Israel disputes this, citing historical, political and religious ties as well as security needs.Friedman said that under certain circumstances, “Israel has the right to retain some, but unlikely all, of the West Bank”.It was unclear which West Bank territories Friedman meant and whether Israel’s retention would be part of a peace accord that includes land swaps – an idea floated in past negotiations – rather than a unilateral move such as annexation.Responding to Friedman, Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said: “Their vision is about annexation of occupied territory, a war crime under international law.”The Trump plan had been expected to be unveiled during an economic conference in Bahrain this month. But a snap election in Israel set for 17 September is likely to delay the rollout.Palestinian leadership has refused to deal with the Trump administration since it recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Palestinians want the eastern part of the city, captured by Israel in 1967 and annexed in a move unrecognised abroad, as their future capital.In March, Trump recognised Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, territory Israel captured from Syria in the same war and later annexed.Netanyahu told army radio in April that Trump’s Golan step showed it was possible to annex West Bank settlements “within a gradual process and I prefer to do so with American recognition”.He added: “I have been discussing the question of extending sovereignty with the Americans for the past six months.”A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: “No plan for unilateral annexation by Israel of any portion of the West Bank has been presented by Israel to the US, nor is it under discussion.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60c1fab1a4ec48f1de6a4241875022e4a1fff8be/0_264_3900_2340/master/3900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43f9ad5617aea450966b2bfc5c806263","title":"venezuela puerto ordaz gold mines armed gangs","story":"Puerto Ordaz has been swept up in a gold rush that powers the city as the armed groups running the mines flourishby  Emma Graham-Harrison and Clavel Rangel in Puerto OrdazPuerto Ordaz was once Venezuela’s industrial hub, a modernist dream of broad boulevards and ranks of factories and gateway to a belt of rich oilfields that funded government largesse for decades.As the economy has crumbled though, the modern city of steel and aluminium has been swallowed by its past, transformed into little more than an outpost of the gold mines a few hours’ drive away in the fringes of the Amazon.There, in swampy, malaria-ridden pits controlled by criminal gangs, men labour away much as they would have done centuries ago. The lumps of yellow metal they extract through backbreaking work now power the city gold has become so pervasive that medieval-style barter is replacing hard currency across the city.Gold also increasingly pays the bills for the national government in distant Caracas. With oil revenues dwindling and US sanctions biting, the president, Nicolás Maduro, has been relying on wealth from the mines to keep the government afloat during a months-long standoff with the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó.So the government has allowed the illegal industry and the armed groups that run them to flourish, spawning an epidemic of violence, disease and environmental devastation, and drawing in much of the remaining population of Puerto Ordaz.“More than half our clients want to pay in gold,” said one estate agent in Puerto Ordaz, who described a recent nerve-racking drive through the increasingly lawless city to broker a deal, following buyers carrying an apartment’s worth of precious metal.“The client said ‘come in our car’, but I said: ‘No, we are traveling behind you.’ With the insecurity you don’t know who knows you have gold,” added the agent, who is still struggling with the new norms of doing business, and asked not to be named for her safety.“It was the first time I learned the value of a university education in grams of gold. I could not have imagined it.”Shopping malls have been taken over by metal dealers, who sit idly in rows of shops that once sold electronics or clothes, waiting for miners to arrive with crumbs of yellow to exchange for cash. Men with wary eyes and barely concealed guns stand near the main exits.They are the most discreet public face of an epidemic of violence nurtured in the mines, but already spilling beyond them. Gold fever has fuelled a proliferation of armed gangs, drawn in a Colombian guerrilla group, the ELN, fostered corruption in the national security forces, and insecurity in Puerto Ordaz.Disease has also festered in the mines then followed gold and miners to Puerto Ordaz, reviving malaria in a region where it was once stamped out.Troubles in the country’s remote east usually make fewer headlines than crises along the western border with Colombia, the main route for millions of migrants trying to escape Venezuela’s misery. But locals say the lawlessness brewing in the remote mining camps is an underestimated risk.“Here in Bolívar state, we have the conditions to finance chaos, because we have gold,” said Peraza.“In Caracas they don’t know what is going on here. They are so focused on the question of oil, because its been the economic heart of the country for 100 years. But the oil has dried up and no one has realised how reality changed.”Gold is far easier to transport, and less complex to extract, if you have a workforce desperate enough to do the dangerous, dirty work by hand.The men who dig for gold – and it is all men, women only work as cooks or in brothels at the mines – include professionals whose jobs were engulfed by the crisis or whose salaries have been eroded by hyperinflation to levels that will buy them a few loaves of bread, or perhaps a bag of rice.Some never return from the brutal pits, whatever deaths they met there not registered, their bodies never officially buried. Among the missing are photographer Wilmer González, who both chronicled the mines and worked in them.In the region, many who are not directly digging for gold are dependent on the gold economy to survive. Every day a steady stream of passenger cars head to the mines loaded with jerrycans of diesel, many driven by white-collar workers.“I have no choice if we want to eat – I haven’t been paid for months,” said Lucia, a primary school teacher who twice a week makes the 18 hour round trip with her husband and two small children, risking malaria and violence for a small markup that will keep a roof over their heads, and the most basic of meals on the table. She asked not to use her real name for fear of losing her job.Once a supporter of Hugo Chávez, she lost faith in the government as the economy collapsed around her once-prosperous family, destroying her husband’s blue collar factory job and turning her teaching post into a voluntary one.The lure of the gold buried under the forests of eastern Venezuela is centuries old. Walter Raleigh sailed up the Orinoco river past the current-day site of Puerto Ordaz in search of the mythical El Dorado, city of gold, which was never found but lent its name to an undistinguished town on the road to Brazil.In recent decades, as Venezuela swam in the easy profits from oil, the gold mines seemed more like historic curiosity than going concern. The town of Callao, a regional hub and popular tourist spot, was known mostly for its carnival festivities.Visitors strolled down quiet colonial streets, where shops sold handmade gold jewellery, and one firm had a concession to run a large, modern mine. Today no one would visit for fun.It become an unuruly and dangerous jumping-off point for the reinvigorated mines, its streets lined with gold dealers and packed with miners. The crowds occasionally part for a luxury SUV with blacked-out windows and an armed escort, the closest most in the area will get to seeing the power behind the money.The workers come thinking they will only stay a short time, then leave with a small fortune, but most make a pittance and spend much of it locally, on food and drink or in brothels. In the area there is a saying: “What the mine gives, the mine takes away”.Those who reaps most profits are largely invisible. Perhaps the most remote, connected through a tangled chain of intermediaries, is the government itself, after it discovered in the mines a way to turn fast-devaluing bank notes into pure gold.The trade is funding Maduro’s government as petrodollars dry up. Venezuela has the world’s largest oil reserves, but the industry has crumbled under the weight of corruption and mismanagement. The state-owned firm PDVsA, once a cash cow for Caracas, can now barely pay its bills.“I only accept PDVSA jobs where they pay me upfront, otherwise I don’t get paid” said one executive at an oil services firm in Puerto Ordaz.But the government’s need for funds has not diminished with oil production, and so every month trucks trundle through Puerto Ordaz carrying boxes of bank notes heading for the mines. Paper money has been abandoned for digital payments in most of Venezuela, but in mines beyond the reach of cellphone coverage and without power supply, hard cash still reigns supreme.It is exchanged for gold, which is then shipped overseas, including to Turkey, earning hard currency for the government, an investigation by Reuters found. That makes the area particularly valuable, and particularly tense.Guaidó has alarmed even his allies by flirting with the idea of a US intervention, which in the east would fatally disrupt the delicate power balance between local gangs, guerrillas and the corrupt arms of the state security forces.“At the moment we have a pax mafioso,” said Peraza. But as soon as you have a confrontation – as soon as you break the pact – there will be anarchy. This is what would happen with an invasion.”"},{"url":null,"title":"a baby born today the climate and their future","story":"Life-support systems that nature provides – an intertwined web that sustains humans, plants and animals – are at risk of unravelling in a matter of decades.Deforestation, intensive agriculture, overfishing, development and other human activities are breaking the bonds that combine to make a healthy planet. Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"National Lottery also says there was one winner of the Lotto Plus 1 top prizeGarda\u0026iacute hope a postmortem will establish exact cause of death of Polish nationalReligious congregations\u0026rsquo properties often located on land ripe for developmentScotland had warned it will take action against Irish vessels fishing around isletCourt heard evidence relating to four alleged victims, including two boys and two girlsUndertones frontman Feargal Sharkey is made an OBE in this year\u0026rsquos listWomen of all ages participate in this year\u0026rsquos Strip and Dip charity swim in Co WicklowNational Union of Journalists calls for national approach to ensure transparencyFiona Geraghty (27) \u0026lsquowill be forever in my memory ...she was loved deeply,\u0026rsquo brother saysSinn F\u0026eacutein leader says party had \u0026lsquovery difficult\u0026rsquo local and European electionsDrew Harris to receive award while outgoing PSNI chief George Hamilton is knightedDublin site of 19 acres could include 1,200 apartmentsNew directive will allow private astronauts to spend up to 30 days in low-Earth orbitEntire south Dublin coastline off limits to bathers until Wednesday after heavy rainMinister announced halt on ban day after he was told of emmissions threat in rural areasSix Irish juveniles are in St Andrew\u0026rsquos Healthcare Adolescent Service in NorthamptonThree-quarters of those injured were men and average age of patients was 44 yearsIrish Georgian Society concerned at likely removal of 160 trees from UCD-city routeRatoath College\u0026rsquos iPads-only policy sparks controversy over use of technologyTrump beckons over Clohanes schoolchildren who sang for him at Doonbeg course"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3919750.1560024950!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"lotto one winner scoops saturday s jackpot worth over 4m","story":"The winning numbers were 9, 10, 34, 37, 40 and 47, and the bonus number was 7.The winning ticket was sold in the west of the country, the National Lottery has confirmed.There was also one winner of the Lotto Plus 1 top prize, which was worth €1 million for each winner.The winning numbers in that draw were 3, 25, 28, 34, 42, and 47, and the bonus number was 11.

Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas  AFPAhead of the start of the Conservative leadership contest next week, the Peterborough byelection result has exposed in the starkest terms the predicament in which the party finds itself.In a marginal seat that has passed between Britain’s two biggest parties for decades, the Tories were pushed into third place behind Labour and the Brexit Party.Labour’s 31 per cent was the lowest vote share for a winning party in a byelection since 1945. But the Brexit Party’s almost 10,000 votes came mostly from the Conservatives, with Labour losing much less support to the Liberal Democrats and the Greens.More than a fifth of the 313 Conservative MPs at Westminster have majorities smaller than 5,000 and the Brexit Party represents a mortal threat to each of them. Boris Johnson argued on Friday that Peterborough means the Conservatives must deliver Brexit by October 31st to neutralise the Brexit Party.But Jeremy Hunt warned that risking an election before Brexit was delivered by threatening to leave the EU without a deal would allow Jeremy Corbyn “to sneak through the middle”.Peterborough was a setback for the Brexit Party, fresh from its success in last month’s European Parliament elections and full of bluster about its chances in a general election. Peterborough, which voted almost two to one for Brexit, in a byelection triggered by the criminal conviction of the sitting Labour MP, was probably the easiest target the party will ever find.VolunteersLabour owed its victory in large part to its superior ground game and to a small army of committed, well-organised volunteers from Momentum, which supports Mr Corbyn’s leadership. Mr Corbyn said on Friday that Labour had not yet reached the point of shifting its Brexit policy towards unequivocal support for a second referendum.But that change in policy is coming, probably soon after the election of the next Conservative leader. If the Labour leadership doesn’t move first, the membership will make the change at the party conference in September.\u0026nbspBacking a second referendum with a view to remaining in the EU would cost Labour votes in some Leave-voting constituencies. But if the Brexit Party is still around at the next general election, it could take enough votes from the Conservatives to allow Labour to hold such seats on a lower vote share, just as it did in Peterborough.A Labour government, with or without the support of smaller parties, would be unable to deliver Brexit without a second referendum. So the rise of the Brexit Party would have had the effect of making Britain’s departure from the European Union less likely.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

In June 1944, as a Switchboard Operator recently trained in the new technology of VHF radio, 17-year-old Marie Scott practically skipped down all 350 of them, deep into the tunnels underneath the cliffs of Fort Southwick.Living, working and sleeping in the tunnels was not very pleasant: eight-hour watches in a 24-hour duty, then off for a day. For the staff of the Naval Command headquarters just outside Portsmouth, the fetid air and lack of natural light underground meant the steps provided welcome exercise on their way back to the surface.Day and night meant nothing to Marie and her colleagues: the wireless operators, plotters, planners and telegraphists from across the services, who sat at their stations in the windowless offices or slept in small, cramped rooms on three-tier bunks.Even so, they knew their hardships were nothing compared to the men they would be speaking to on the other end of their wireless sets. They’d been informed on June 4 that a big operation was planned for the next day, but hadn’t been told why a 24-hour delay meant that it would now be starting on the sixth.Marie Scott at Southwick House, Portsmouth. She was a 17-year-old switchboard operator on D-DayWhatever was happening up there on the surface, in the air and on the sea off the south coast of Britain, the nine WAAFs, Wrens and Auxiliary Territorial Service personnel in Marie’s section knew this was no rehearsal it was the real thing.“I grew up on that day,” Mrs Scott says. “I became aware of the reality of war.”General Dwight D Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of Allied Expeditionary Forces in Europe, had arrived in Southwick House on June 2 to establish his headquarters for the invasion. Chosen because of its proximity to the port, and to the underground naval command headquarters dug into the cliffs, Southwick House had been requisitioned for the Royal Navy’s navigation school earlier in the war.The date for D-Day was dictated by the weather. With a full moon and suitable tide, the period June 4 to 7 was optimal, with a few days from the 18th as Plan B.If they didn’t go in June, the next suitable tide was not until September and by then the secret would have undoubtedly slipped out. The Germans knew an invasion was coming - the mass of Allied vehicles, manpower and ships meant it was only a matter of time - but they didn’t know where, and they didn’t know when.But there was a problem. The British and American meteorologists had different ways of doing things and couldn’t agree on the most suitable date. The situation was not helped by the fact that James Stagg, Eisenhower’s chief weather adviser and a civilian later given the notional rank of Group Captain in the RAF so as to be more readily accepted by the military, was actually a geophysicist.An intense rivalry had developed between him and the weathermen. Meteorology at this time was more art than science and there hadn’t been any significant advances in the subject since the First World War.  On June 4 Stagg recommended to Eisenhower that the weather was so bad, with high wind and cloud cover, that D-Day, planned for June 5, should be postponed.Eisenhower asked his component commanders their view. “Chancey,” said Air Chief Marshal Leigh Mallory, the air commander. “Do-able but risky” thought Sir Arthur Tedder, Eisenhower’s deputy. General Montgomery, the overall ground force commander, in charge of all British, American and Canadian troops (and later Polish forces) was unequivocal in his belief they should launch.Eisenhower made his decision. “OK, we’ll go,” he said to Stagg. A signal sent to London and Washington stated ‘Halcyon plus five’ (Halcyon being the code word for June 1). The invasion was on.Despite knowing an attack was coming, the remarkable success of Operation Fortitude, under General George Patton’s First US Army Group, had convinced the Germans that any attack in Normandy would be just a ersion for the main assault at Pas-de-Calais.General Patton was considered by the Germans to be the best allied general and therefore certain to be the commander of the coming invasion. He based himself in Kent, with real soldiers bolstered by dummy equipment available for the eyes of German intelligence.Operation Fortitude worked so well that even after D-Day the Germans held many of their best troops in the Calais area expecting a second invasion.Further afield Britain’s secret agents, the Special Operations Executive (SOE), were doing their bit. In some areas, the Germans were using carrier pigeons to send messages. The SOE put birds trained to fly towards Britain in German army pigeon lofts so the messages were delayed or simply disappeared. The French resistance blew up the radio land lines, to force the Germans to use other means of communication which, with Enigma cracked, enabled the Allies to listen in.Pigeons had a vital role in the war Dummy paratroopers were dropped across Seine-Maritime, Calvados and Manche and an SAS team, parachuted into the Cotentin peninsula five miles west of Saint-Lo, installed loudspeakers to play combat noises, including explosions and the sound of soldiers swearing.  The RAF’s 617 Squadron - made famous by the Dambusters raid in 1943 - dropped strips of metal foil known as ‘window’ miles away from Normandy. German radar operators were fooled into thinking they were seeing an approaching naval fleet, where in fact there was none.The deception plan was working. Just as well, there was no way now of stopping the vast armada of ships and aircraft departing on the biggest operation of its kind ever mounted what Eisenhower later called “the great crusade”.Having made his decision, Eisenhower was rendered temporarily powerless as the massive machine of war stirred into action.On the afternoon of June 5, he had been driven to Greenham Common to visit the troops of the 101st Airborne Division, a force expected to have one in every two men killed, wounded or captured. He handed out cigarettes and talked to them about fly fishing a photo from the time captures him with hands aloft, as if explaining how to cast.Eisenhower gives the order of the day to US paratroopers on June 6, 1944 Returning to Southwick House he stood on the ridge to watch the deployment. It was said to be the only time he showed emotion a certain moisture around the eyes. New challenges would face him in the future, but nothing ever again on the scale of D-Day.Just after midnight on June 6, paratroopers from the British 6th Airborne Division, the first of 23,400 airborne troops, jumped into Normandy. The German artillery battery at Merville needed to be silenced before it could fire on to the beaches where British and Canadian forces were due to land a few hours later. Two bridges over the Caen canal and the River Orne were to be seized to prevent German reinforcements arriving from Calais.The glider-borne assault on the bridges was so successful - 15 minutes from landing to capture - they were renamed Pegasus and Horsa Bridges, after the emblem of British airborne forces and the gliders they had flown in on.Lieutenant Herbert Denham ‘Den’ Brotheridge, killed just after midnight on the 6th while leading a charge to seize Pegasus Bridge, was the first allied soldier killed on D-Day.Pegasus Bridge: No 1 glider (in background) piloted by Jim Wallwork landed within feet of the planned targetAt 02:40 Field Marshal von Runstedt, commander of the German Army in France, was told of fighting in Normandy, but still believed the main invasion would be at Pas-de-Calais.Although the potent 21st Panzer Division was available, Hitler was asleep at Berchtesgaden and his staff were too nervous to wake him up to order the reinforcements, as they still thought the fighting was a ersionary raid.It was another two hours before Von Runstedt ordered the 12th SS Panzer Division into action, but his decision was rescinded at 06:30 by General Jodl at the Armed Forces High Command, who still wanted to wait for Hitler to wake up.Assault routes into Normandy - DDAYIn the early hours of June 6, the invasion fleet arrived at the assembly point south of the Isle of Wight called Area Z - better known as Piccadilly Circus - and passed through a lane cleared in the German minefield which extended to Norway. It then turned south, towards the Normandy beaches.At 04:30, an hour after the assault troops had started cross-decking into the landing craft far out in the English Channel, struggling to descend the nets into vessels that were pitching uncertainly below them, and just as Von Runstedt was ordering the Panzer reinforcements, two British X-class midget submarines surfaced off the Normandy coast.For the preceding two days, each craft and their five-man crew had sat silently, waiting for the invasion. Their mission: erect 18-foot telescopic masts equipped with navigation lights and radio beacons to guide British and Canadian landing craft to the beaches.Canadian soldiers from 9th Brigade land with their bicycles at Juno Beach in Bernieres-sur-Mer on D-DayAs H-Hour approached, the time of the ground invasion, rocket launcher barges started firing salvoes onto the beaches in a bid to clear the minefields. On Gold, Juno and Sword beaches in the British sector, where 61,715 British and 21,400 Canadian soldiers were to land, 20,000 rockets blasted the sand, with a similar number fired at Utah and Omaha beaches in the American sector, where 73,000 US troops would be arriving shortly.  However, Forward Observers out at sea struggled to see through the clouds of smoke and brick dust being thrown up from the coast by the naval gunfire. Consequently, much ammunition was wasted on targets randomly picked off the map. As the landing craft approached the beaches, smelling of diesel, sweat and vomit, the men geared themselves for the imminent assault unaware that much of the German coastal defence remained intact.Security around the operation had been rigid. The secret map board in Southwick House, depicting the coasts of England and Normandy and which showed all the locations of the deployed forces, covered an entire wall.Produced by carpenters at Chad Valley toys in Birmingham, the section was one small part of a larger piece that had been ordered, showing Britain and the entire European coastline from Norway to Spain.When the carpenters had erected the section they commented that the invasion was obviously planned for Normandy. “Yes,” came the answer, “and you’re going to jail.”Allowed to do odd jobs around the house by day, the two men were locked up each night. They had only planned to stay for the weekend but were kept at Southwick House until September. History does not record what they told their wives upon their return.Not even the tea ladies were allowed in. One Wren, Marsi Taylor (known as Aunt Marsi),  had worked in the headquarters throughout the war but had never seen the map room before visiting in 2014.Two bizarre security incidents had particularly concerned the authorities and show how seriously efforts to deny the plan’s discovery by German spies had been taken.In early 1944 codewords related to D-Day were revealed in the ’s crossword puzzle: Gold and Sword were dismissed as commonly-used crossword answers, but then more exotic words started to appear.On May 22 came the clue ‘Red Indian on the Missouri (5)’. The answer: Omaha, codename for the beach to be taken by the 1st US Assault Division. Then, on May 27, came Overlord, the name for the entire Normandy campaign. Coincidence? Perhaps.But on May 30 came Mulberry (the floating harbours used in the landings) and on June 1 the solution for 15 down was Neptune (the naval assaults onto the beaches). Alarm bells rang and MI5 visited Leonard Dawe, the ’s crossword compiler, who later said “they made me sweat”.Troops landing on D-Day at Sword beach. The picture was taken from a photo reconnaissance Mustang aircraft of II (Army Cooperation) SquadronThe second case involved Helen Duncan, a spiritualist and clairvoyant. She was the celebrity mystic of her day and had supposedly given seances to King George VI and Churchill. She was also a con artist who used to spit out fluid claiming it was ectoplasm, while her husband rattled the windows.She claimed she could talk to the dead through the spirit of an Able Seaman who had been on HMS Barham, a battleship sunk in the Meditaerranean with the loss of 861 men. The Admiralty was concerned as it had not released the details of HMS Barham’s loss.In the febrile and paranoid security atmosphere ahead of D-Day, Duncan was put under surveillance and later arrested after a seance attended by two superstitious naval officers who thought she might reveal the secrets of the imminent invasion. She was acquitted of fraud but found guilty of witchcraft under the 1735 Witchcraft Act and sentenced to nine months in Holloway prison.D-Day 75 years on | Read moreAt 06:30 US troops from the 1st and 29th Divisions landed over a four-mile front at Omaha beach. The US 4th Division put ashore the first of 23,250 men on Utah beach at the same time.Immediately there were problems at Omaha. Many landing craft missed their targets or were swamped in the choppy seas. Of the 29 Duplex Drive tanks (modified Shermans with floats) in the first wave, 27 sank. German resistance - from the 352nd Infantry Division - was stronger than anticipated.On one landing craft a flamethrower operator had been hit and his weapon exploded, blasting him into the sea and spewing blazing fuel over the decks. The vessel caught fire and continued burning all day, periodically lit up again by detonations from exploding 20mm Oerlikon ammunition.At 07:25 the British 3rd Division landed at Sword beach, intending to take the town of Caen and the Carpiquet aerodrome by nightfall. The seizure of the La Breche strongpoint covering the beach took three hours and cost the South Lancashires 107 men killed. On one part of the beach a solitary French girl was seen wading through the surf to help wounded men out of the water.Five minutes after Sword, Gold beach was assaulted by the British 50th Division who must hold the position to allow the two Mulberry harbours - vast prefabricated structures vital for offloading the two million troops and critical supplies - to be established.Marie Scott, manning her VHF Switchboard in Fort Southwick, was shocked when the soldiers on the beaches started radioing back. “When they passed their message you could hear gunfire, cannon fire, all the sounds of war,” she said.“Suddenly you realised that this was the reality of war. Men were dying there. And at 17, and being rather naive, I don’t think it had fully registered, until the moment I got the first message back and could hear the sounds of war.”British troops take positions on Sword beachAfter hours without a decision, and with Hitler still asleep, at 07:40 General Edgar Feuchtinger unilaterally ordered his 21st Panzer Division to reinforce the eastern beaches. Hitler woke up an hour and a half later, but regarded the news from Normandy as excellent, still thinking - thanks to Operation Fortitude\u0027s chain of deceptions - that the morning\u0027s events were a cover for the real invasion at Pas-de-Calais.The assault on Utah progressed well, even though the tide had taken the landing craft a mile south of their intended positions. Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt Jr, the 56-year-old son of the former president, was in the first wave.Meanwhile, wading towards Sword beach, in a bid to rally the men of 1st Special Service Brigade, Piper Bill Millin struck up Hieland Laddie as his Cameron tartan floated around him. The man behind him was hit and sank, but Millin kept going. Once ashore he did not run, but walked up and down the beach, blasting out a series of tunes, including The Road to the Isles. German prisoners later admitted that they had not attempted to shoot him because they thought he had lost his mind.Piper Bill Millin strikes up Blue Bonnets as 1st SS Brigade Commandos wade ashore at Ouistreham on Sword beachThe 3rd Canadian Infantry Division landed at Juno beach at 07:45, having had H-Hour delayed by 10 minutes due to rough seas. But even then some craft were late. As a result, many hit obstacles submerged by the tide and the coxswains could do little to prevent the landing craft becoming entangled. The Engineers struggled to clear a path and almost a third of the vessels were destroyed by mines. They took heavy casualties.Likewise, the situation at Omaha was becoming desperate. Vehicles were stuck in the deep water and wounded men on the beach were drowning as the tide came in. General Bradley, commander of the US First Army and in charge of the assaults on Omaha and Utah, watched the chaos from the cruiser the USS Augusta. He came close to stopping the operation and considered erting troops from Utah.Pinned down on Omaha, Colonel George Taylor, commander of the US 16th Infantry Regiment, shouted to his men: “Two sorts of people are going to stay on this beach, those who are dead and those who are going to die. Let’s get the hell out of here!” There were hundreds of bodies on the beach and floating in the water. Commonwealth personnel, nearly all British and Canadian, outnumbered the Americans on D-Day. Of the 156,000 men landed in France on June 6, 73,000 were American, and 83,000 were British and Canadian, while the Commonwealth naval contingent was twice that of the Americans. The Germans were formidable opponents, and by this stage of the war the British Armed Forces were tired, having been fighting for nearly five years. The Americans wanted to get the job done and some questioned why it was taking Britain so long. But in truth the country was almost exhausted and close to bankruptcy.In late 1943 the Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison, had told Churchill that Britain was unable to replace any battle casualties. Consequently, Montgomery was fighting the war with the Army he had, rather than the one he wanted, and morale was fragile. He was criticised after the war for excessive caution, but the priority at the time was to preserve his fighting power. He had been told by Churchill to win well and sufficient for Britain to maintain her world power status.Ron Smith was a 19-year-old electrical technician on Landing Craft Tank 947 when he left Gosport early on D-Day. He thought at first it was another rehearsal, like he was used to in Scotland, but the skipper said they were going to France instead. “Do we need a passport?” asked one of the crew.The craft landed on Sword beach at 07:30, closed up, at action stations, carrying six 80-tonne Churchill tanks, with a rocket ship behind Ron blasting the mines on the beach. “I don’t reckon a whelk could have survived on that beach,” he said.Ron Smith, who was on landing Craft Tank 947 which was sunk by shellfireRon’s landing craft was hit by shellfire. The third tank was immobilised, blocking the exit ramp, and the torpedoes on the landing craft exploded, killing a number of men on board. They managed to get off the beach but the craft was partly submerged, due to the damaged tank on the ramp, and was mistaken for a submarine on their way back to Portsmouth.Despite the shock of the action Ron, now 94, was impressed with the whole operation. “It was beautifully organised,” he said, “if you can say that in a war.”Back in Eisenhower’s headquarters at Southwick House there was a frenetic atmosphere. The map room was a hive of activity and noise, with telegrams coming in, phones ringing and signals presented to staff officers. Along one wall a huge gantry seated service men and women reporting the progress of the landings. The room was enveloped in a fug of cigarette smoke.People rushed to put things on the map - and remove them. Sybil Parker, a Wren working in the headquarters, had a Canadian boyfriend called Captain James Morley. Sybil watched as the small wooden marker denoting his ship was removed from the map board after being hit by enemy fire. She found out 10 weeks later that he had been killed on D-Day at Juno beach.Sybil Parker only learned her beloved had died when his ship was removed from the big map In the middle of it all was Eisenhower. Under huge stress, he ate little and slept even less, surviving on five packets of cigarettes a day and a lot of coffee.  Billetted in tents in the grounds of Southwick House, Eisenhower relaxed by reading cheap cowboy books and was known to have a volcanic temper that disappeared as quickly as it had flared.With his political master, Roosevelt, 3,000 miles away in Washington, Eisenhower was under great pressure from Churchill. Repeatedly dragged to Chequers, he was served tepid Irish stew, for which he developed a lifelong aversion, and had to endure Churchill’s rambling, alcohol-fuelled monologues.Churchill could be a “terrible pest” in the words of Field Marshal Alan Brooke, Chief of the Imperial General Staff. He had turned up at Southwick House unannounced on May 3 with General Charles de Gaulle. His force of nature character was unwelcome, as was his earlier insistence that the British and Canadian beaches should be called Goldfish, Jellyfish and Swordfish. He was told men shouldn’t have to die on a beach called Jellyfish. It was changed to Juno and fish was dropped from the objective names.  The first tanks enter Sword Beach, near Ouistreham Churchill’s extraordinary ability to lead was beyond question, but he did have one particularly concerning trait: a desire to be in the thick of the action. A soldier at heart, he was never entirely happy allowing the admirals, generals and air marshals a free hand and often wanted to see things for himself.His insistence on being able to watch the beach assaults for himself aboard HMS Belfast  and then set foot on the French coast presented Eisenhower with one of his more delicate diplomatic conundrums. He elected to speak to Alan Lascelles, Private Secretary to King George VI, who, in turn, took the matter to the Monarch.Winston Churchill visiting the Normandy landing beaches in France with Field Marshal Montgomery the month after D-DayThe King wrote a letter to Churchill. It read: My Dear Winston, I want to make one more appeal to you not to go to sea on D-Day. Please consider my own position. I am a younger man than you. I am a sailor and as King I am the head of all three services. There is nothing I would like better than to go to sea, although I have agreed to stay at home. Is it fair that you should then do exactly what I should have liked to do myself?He went on:  You will see very little but you will be at considerable risk. You will be inaccessible at a critical time when vital decisions might have to be taken. However unobtrusive you may be, your very presence on board is bound to be a very heavy additional responsibility to the Admiral and Captain...Churchill stayed at home.De Gaulle likewise was a prickly house guest. He had just arrived from Algiers and was livid to be told about the invasion - which his staff had had no part in planning - and that Eisenhower, rather than he, was to run a provisional government in France.That the US Treasury had been printing ‘French occupation dollars’ was a further point of tension. De Gaulle, already deeply suspicious of what he saw as an Anglo-Saxon plot to marginalise France, objected to the term ‘occupation’.It was at this point Eisenhower’s true greatness shone through. He had the ability to calm things down and was the embodiment of a coalition soldier, able to hold together a very fractious group.Eisenhower had walked in the gardens of Southwick House with De Gaulle. They smoked, and the American let the Frenchman, whom he outranked by three stars, harangue him about the plan. In an inspired moment, Eisenhower tuned and said “General, do you have any further advice for me?”De Gaulle, acknowledging Eisenhower’s patience and position, then said “Mon General, if I were you I would delay no further” and he left. Churchill departed also, in a huff because he had not been allowed to interfere in any way. He said to the staff “good luck and God speed, but I’ve been told not to talk to you,” before storming off.By early afternoon Juno, Sword, Gold and Utah beaches were largely stable and the situation at Omaha was improving, although many hours behind schedule. Lord Lovat and his Commandos, accompanied by piper Bill Millin, had relieved Major John Howard and the 2nd Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry at the Bénouville bridges. Georges Gondrée, proprietor of the Café Gondreé, approached with champagne for Lovat. He was waved away with the words: I\u0027m working.The forces of 50th Division had pushed inland four miles from Gold beach towards the town of Creully and 47 Commando Royal Marines had taken Port-en-Bessin to close the gap with the US forces at Omaha. Caen, home to 60,000 civilians, was bombed at 13:30 by over 70 B-24s of the 2nd Bombardment Division in an attempt to cut German communication lines. Despite a leaflet drop over the town earlier, warning civilians of an Allied air attack, there were many casualties.Winston Churchill talking to British and Canadian troops in Caen, in July 1944  At 15:00  the first sections of two massive artificial harbours code-named Mulberry headed across the Channel. Built of concrete and steel they were critical in the resupply of the Allied forces. It was not until 20:55 that the town of Arromanches, south of Gold beach, was captured, enabling the safe deployment of the Mulberry harbours. Reinforcements started to arrive by glider in the evening. Operation Mallard launched 250 gliders, with RAF fighter escort, in support of the British 6th Airborne Division. Denzil Cooper, then a 23-year-old Sergeant in the Glider Pilot Regiment, flew the third aircraft into Ranville at 21:00, towed behind an Albemarle. Horsa gliders were designed so that the tail could be detached once on the ground, for the easy deployment of the vehicles or men inside.Approaching Ranville in attack formation, he saw the tail of a neighbouring glider suddenly drop off, causing the aircraft to plummet to the ground. “I thought, hmm, that’s the end of them,” he said.Aerial view of pieces of the Mulberry Harbour at Arromanches, built to help troops and machinery onto the beach By the end of the day the 159,000 Allied troops, marines, airmen and naval personnel ashore had successfully established four sizeable beachheads. The invasion front remained vulnerable to German counter-attack, and there was still terrible fighting ahead, but a crucial step had been taken towards liberating Europe.Professor Richard Holmes said of the Normandy campaign: “The forces of a mighty coalition had entered the continent of Europe and mistakes not withstanding, struck a telling blow at its occupiers. They deserve our gratitude.”A month after D-Day, on the afternoon of July 11, Eisenhower found a handwritten note inside his wallet. It had been written on June 5 as he was driven to Greenham Common to visit the 101st Airborne Division.He had prepared the note in case the landings were repulsed and the operation had failed, in a bid to shield his staff from criticism.   The note said: Our landings in the Cherbourg and Le Havre area failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops. My decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best information available. The troops, the air and the navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone.As the longest day - as D-Day became known - drew to a close 4,413 Allied soldiers were dead. German losses are thought to be between 4,000 and 9,000. The whole Normandy campaign lasted 77 days (Montgomery had expected 90) and resulted in the destruction of the German 7th Army and 5th Panzer Army.In total 209,672 Allied soldiers were killed, wounded or listed as missing. This casualty rate, including the Germans and civilians, was 6,674 killed a day, each day of the Normandy campaign- a rate that exceeds the attrition rate of Verdun, the Somme and Passchendaele during World War One. An infantry Platoon Commander had a one-in-seven chance of surviving longer than two weeks.Casualties and Deaths - DDAYMarie Scott is now 92, and on June 5, 2019 will be presented with the Legion d’honneur, France’s highest award, as a mark of the respect France continues to have for the men and women who helped liberate the country.Mrs Scott says the significance of D-Day dawned on her only in retrospect. “To have been awarded the Legion d’honneur was remarkable, almost unbelievable, truly overwhelming.“But in comparison to the men who landed on the beaches and were injured or died, there is no comparison.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Call in a vicar to pray for your office.A new book of blessings includes a special prayer to use before going on the internet, as well as blessings for offices, computer systems and factories.Time was when vicars were called on to bless baptisms, weddings and funerals. But now, they’re asked to bless every aspect of daily life.‘We asked vicars what they had to bless, and this book is the result,’ says publisher and vicar, Revd Christine Smith. Those who’ve struggled with intractable computer systems may welcome the special prayers in Consecrations, Blessings and Prayers, published by Canterbury Press, for the installation of a new computer network.The Church of England has created a new book of blessing to assist modern-day worshipers ‘May it be an inspiration to do good,’ the blessing says and, ‘a profitable investment.’In medieval times, prayers might have been said to bless a plough or a field before work began.Now, prayers focus on our state of mind before using the internet, and how we use it. Statistics suggest that one in seven web searches are for pornography. Online banking fraud has doubled since 2011, according to a study by Cambridge University.The prayers ask that ‘through our journeys through the internet we will direct our hands and eyes only to that which is pleasing’ to God. And, in a move likely to be approved by the FA, who issued guidance to fans about social media use last week, the prayers ask that we ‘treat with charity and patience all those souls whom we encounter’ online.‘We need this prayer because when we open that door to the internet and social media, anything can happen,’ says Revd Smith.‘It might make people stop and think before they vent their spleen online, especially if they print it out and put it on their screen.’This, she adds, is not ‘a once in a lifetime blessing’ but one that needed to be said every day. Prayers are also ‘I’m sure modern work places need blessings,’ she added.‘There are high levels of stress in modern work places. People are going flat out. A blessing will enable them to think and breathe, and that’s important.’Consecrations, Blessings and Prayers, also provides prayers of blessing for offices, asking God that there would be ‘respect, liking and good relations between those who work here’. And, pre-empting potentially autocratic bosses, the prayer asks God that ‘those in charge never expect too much from those whom they employ’, while asking that employees ‘behave responsibly and honestly’.‘May this office,’ the prayer continues, ‘become a branch office of your kingdom and may we take all our more important orders directly from you’.There are prayers for every kind of work place from factories and shops to farms, fire engines and warships.There’s even a prayer for a van, perhaps as a counterpoint to the curses often heaped on white van drivers. ‘Guide our hands and our hearts to patient and charitable road use,’ the prayer asks for white van drivers. And we’d all say ‘amen’ to that.Church of EnglandThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

They lost the skill at being able to do the one thing that people needed from them - to provide books.“They have been told endlessly that children don’t read anymore, they just watch television and they use the internet to find out anything that they want. So people within local governments started asking why should we provide libraries then?“There’s a battle going on and it’s about what the libraries are for. They are not there to provide a service for the local council as a community centre. They are there to provide reading.”Mr Coates polled 300 UK residents about their reading habits, with the figures showing that 87 per cent have made use of a book in the previous 12 months.However, the number of adults who had obtained their last book from a library stood at just 8 per cent for those aged 10 per cent for 25 to 54-year-olds and 12 per cent for those aged over 54.In a survey of 1,100 people in the US, the use of libraries was far higher - with 32 per cent of those aged between eight and 17 accessing their last book from a library.“Public and educational libraries play a very significant part in the provision of printed books to readers” in the US, the survey concluded.“Twenty years ago, UK libraries insisted they were there to be community centres and started installing loads of computers and activities. But at that point millions of books from public libraries were removed,” Mr Coates said.“They have these halo around their heads, saying they are all about education and community - but actually they are not doing the one job that people want you to do,” he added.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Brexit is greatly exacerbating sector’s problemsClick to followThe IndependentFord is set to close its engine plant in Bridgend next yearSo it’s goodbye Bridgend. With carmaker\u0026nbspFord shutting its engine plant down there, at the direct cost of 1,700 jobs, not to mention all the roles that will be lost in the supply chain, the future for the town looks bleak.\u0026nbspAll that talk about the\u0026nbsp“special relationship” with the US with Donald Trump in town and yet South Wales is losing out to Mexico.\u0026nbspThat’s where the cost advantage lies.\u0026nbspFord to close Bridgend plant in 2020 with loss of 1,700 jobsFears Ford factory could close costing 1,500 jobsFord warns no-deal Brexit will force it to reconsider UK presenceFord is apparently saying it isn’t Brexit. And maybe Bridgend would have been doomed without it. But the company has previously warned that it would have to consider its UK presence in the event of no deal.The problem with Brexit\u0026nbspis that it imposes a cost penalty on every manufacturer in Britain.\u0026nbspThat penalty is theoretical at the moment because we aren’t yet out of the union. But companies like\u0026nbspFord have to look years into the future and without any clear idea about how it will all end up, they’re reliant on worst-case scenarios, such as the imposition WTO style tariffs on goods going in either direction.\u0026nbspWhere the decision on a plant is a marginal one, and even a not so marginal one, Brexit will inevitably tip things over the edge. There is clear evidence that it is already playing a deeply detrimental role when it comes to decisions about investment\u0026nbspmanufacturers are making.Earlier this week,\u0026nbspEY’s regular report into foreign direct investment found a\u0026nbsp35 per cent fall in the money coming into UK manufacturing when compared with 2017. The most recent set of Purchasing Managers’ Index figures showed the sector is now shrinking as the wider economy stagnates.The GMB union, which is doing its best to support its members through what will be a miserable process, says 500,000 manufacturing jobs have gone over the last decade.\u0026nbspMany more redundancies are pending. There are Jaguar’s woes, the closure of Honda’s plant in Swindon, the Sword of Damocles hanging over British Steel.\u0026nbspSet against that, the government’s much-vaunted industrial strategy would be considered a miserable failure except that, as events have rather served to prove, it doesn’t really have one.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.It is a strategy in name only.\u0026nbspThat has to change, otherwise the sector will continue to wither on the vine, something that would be hugely damaging. It is still an important part of the UK economy. Particularly in certain specialist areas, Britain is rather good at it, and it still provides thousands of well-paid jobs in places where there aren’t many of those to be had, where there aren’t many alternatives. Places like Bridgend.\u0026nbspTo avoid more of them being plunged into the horror facing that town, this government, or more likely a future one run by people with a little more concern for working people and their jobs, needs to do more than just talk about an industrial strategy. It needs to heed the\u0026nbspGMB’s call for action.\u0026nbspThese events don’t\u0026nbspjust hurt the economy. They\u0026nbspserve to widen the alarming cracks that have opened up in British society, cracks that are being exploited by some very unpleasant people.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Given that many of the people who incur them are under financial stress, that can only be seen as welcome development.\u0026nbspThis sort of policy work can take time (overdraft fees have been a sore point for years), but the FCA is, as a rule, fairly good at it.\u0026nbspCampaigners I have spoken to have also given it high marks for the work it has been doing on financial exclusion, for example. And prior to its overdraft reforms it had capped the interest rates imposed by payday lenders and followed up by clipping the wings of the rent to own sector.\u0026nbspSo, good at policymaking bad at supervisory practice?\u0026nbspThe criticism faced by the watchdog has extended beyond the Woodford mess, about which it could argue that such funds sometimes underperform and investors’ assets are still there. They’ll be able to get their money out once the fund\u0027s illiquid holdings\u0026nbspare sold, albeit probably at a substantial discount.\u0026nbspTake the collapse of bond firm London Capital \u0026amp\u0026nbspFinance, whose unregulated mini bonds left thousands of people out of pocket. It has led to the creation of a judge led inquiry which will, among other things, consider whether the FCA should have intervened at a much earlier stage.\u0026nbspThe regulator has also taken heat over the handling of complaints from small businesses about Royal Bank of Scotland’s Global Restructuring Group, and whistleblowers at Lloyds Banking Group. And there are other such examples.Set against that is the fact that the watchdog employs 3,700 people, of whom just 900 are involved in the frontline supervision of nearly 60,000 firms. Its remit also keeps expanding. Claims management firms and funeral plans are both being added.\u0026nbspIt begs the question: Does the FCA’s apparent slow footedness stem from its failure to effectively utilise its resources? Or does it have enough?Chief executive Andrew Bailey has a case to answer on the former. A couple of years ago one of his first big decisions was to set up a windy review of its mission, which really ought to have been obvious.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

The company provides automotive and and industrial parts worldwide and the Llanelli plant employs over 200 people. Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateThe number of cars built in the UK in April plummeted by almost half compared with a year ago, with the drop exacerbated by manufacturers bringing forward summer production stoppages in anticipation of a Brexit\u0026nbspthat was ultimately postponed.Ford workers expressed surprise at how soon the decision to shut the Bridgend plant had been made.Len Jones, 48, who has worked at the plant for seven-and-a-half years, said: It\u0027s devastating. Everyone\u0027s got mortgages to pay and families to support.I expected a little more time to get things sorted.When we found out, everyone was just silent. They gave us letters and we just all went home.It\u0027s hard to take in really, even though we expected it. Now it\u0027s official, it\u0027s a bad thing, really.One worker, who gave the name of Stephen, said: When they came out with the statement, you just don\u0027t take it in do you. But, such is life.The writing has been on the wall for a long time. We knew when the Sigma engine finished there was no replacement. We knew when the AJ engine finished there was no replacement. The predicted volumes for new Dragon engine were 250,000, then 125,000, then the last thing we had was for 70,000.Unions described the news as a “hammer blow” for the community in Bridgend and a “grotesque act of economic betrayal”.The GMB union released an analysis on Thursday showing that the UK has lost half a million manufacturing jobs over the past decade.Ford has announced thousands of job cuts globally\u0026nbspthis year, largely affecting white-collar workers, as the company\u0026nbspseeks to shed unprofitable parts of its business.Brexit could mean more robots in UK manufacturingBrexit prompts slowdown in manufacturing as firms shun UK Video reveals how car manufacturing has changed over 50 yearsBrexit causes record rise in stockpilingUntil recently, the company’s\u0026nbspUK factories had not been thought to be immediately at risk as part of those plans.However, it is understood Ford did not replace a major contract to build engines for Jaguar Land Rover\u0026nbspat the\u0026nbspBridgend plant. That work comes to an end next year.Ford also operates a diesel engine plant at Dagenham, east London, and another factory making transmissions in Halewood, near\u0026nbspLiverpool.The Bridgend plant has been under threat because of falling demand for the two engines it makes\u0026nbspand lower projections for the Dragon engine it is scheduled to start making this year. It has been manufacturing engines for 40 years.\u0026nbspFord’s European profits plummeted 82 per cent last year, in part because of a fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote in June 2016.Jeff Beck, a GMB Union regional organiser, said: “Regardless of today’s announcement GMB will continue to work with Ford, our sister unions and the Welsh government to find a solution to the issue and mitigate the effects of this devastating news.“What makes it worse is Donald Trump is in this country talking about a possible trade deal between the UK and the US – yet when the plant closes the new line is likely to be produced in Mexico by an American company.”Len McCluskey, the\u0026nbspgeneral secretary of Unite the Union, said: “Ford’s decision to shut its Bridgend engine plant in 2020 is a grotesque act of economic betrayal.Car industry workers want to leave the EU“These workers and this community have stayed faithful to Ford, as have UK customers – this is still Ford’s largest European market – through thick and thin, but have been treated disgracefully in return by this company.“Ford broke promise after promise to the UK. First, it was that it would build 500,000 engines at Bridgend. That fell to a quarter of a million, then fell again and again to now just 80,000. The company has deliberately run down its UK operations so that now not a single Ford vehicle – car or van – is made in the UK.”The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “I am aware of the reports and I understand that they will be very worrying for workers at Bridgend but the reports are unconfirmed by the company so it is not appropriate for me to speculate or comment further at this time.”Carwyn Jones, a\u0026nbspformer Welsh government leader who is currently an assembly member for Bridgend, told the Press Association: “This has all been very sudden. There was no warning about this at all. It seems to me that any decision, whatever that decision is, would have been taken very recently.“From my perspective, I want to know what’s going on as to with the workers and want to know a reason for the decision, and to work with the Welsh government to see what we can do to help the workers here.“It’s the biggest single employer in the area, I remember it being built in the late Seventies. There are relatively few suppliers locally but there are a number of businesses that provide services for the plant itself and they would be severely affected because for a lot of them this is the only contract they have.”Ford announced last month it was cutting 7,000 white-collar jobs worldwide, with up to 550 expected in the UK.The US manufacturer said the cuts represented 10 per cent of its global salaried workforce and 20 per cent of its management positions.A spokesperson for Unite said: “Our priority is our members’ jobs, the communities and livelihoods in the supply chain that Ford Bridgend supports.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The average selling price of a property across the UK in May was £237,837 after a 0.5 per cent month-to-month rise.Experts cautioned that Halifax’s index had been an “outlier” in recent months and that other house price measures have consistently pointed to a slowdown, particularly in London and the southeast of England.\u0026nbspNationwide reported that house prices fell 0.2 per cent between April and May and\u0026nbsprose\u0026nbspjust 0.6 per cent over the year.Created with Sketch.

The company provides automotive and and industrial parts worldwide and the Llanelli plant employs over 200 people. Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateThe number of cars built in the UK in April plummeted by almost half compared with a year ago, with the drop exacerbated by manufacturers bringing forward summer production stoppages in anticipation of a Brexit\u0026nbspthat was ultimately postponed.Ford workers expressed surprise at how soon the decision to shut the Bridgend plant had been made.Len Jones, 48, who has worked at the plant for seven-and-a-half years, said: It\u0027s devastating. Everyone\u0027s got mortgages to pay and families to support.I expected a little more time to get things sorted.When we found out, everyone was just silent. They gave us letters and we just all went home.It\u0027s hard to take in really, even though we expected it. Now it\u0027s official, it\u0027s a bad thing, really.One worker, who gave the name of Stephen, said: When they came out with the statement, you just don\u0027t take it in do you. But, such is life.The writing has been on the wall for a long time. We knew when the Sigma engine finished there was no replacement. We knew when the AJ engine finished there was no replacement. The predicted volumes for new Dragon engine were 250,000, then 125,000, then the last thing we had was for 70,000.Unions described the news as a “hammer blow” for the community in Bridgend and a “grotesque act of economic betrayal”.The GMB union released an analysis on Thursday showing that the UK has lost half a million manufacturing jobs over the past decade.Ford has announced thousands of job cuts globally\u0026nbspthis year, largely affecting white-collar workers, as the company\u0026nbspseeks to shed unprofitable parts of its business.Brexit could mean more robots in UK manufacturingBrexit prompts slowdown in manufacturing as firms shun UK Video reveals how car manufacturing has changed over 50 yearsBrexit causes record rise in stockpilingUntil recently, the company’s\u0026nbspUK factories had not been thought to be immediately at risk as part of those plans.However, it is understood Ford did not replace a major contract to build engines for Jaguar Land Rover\u0026nbspat the\u0026nbspBridgend plant. That work comes to an end next year.Ford also operates a diesel engine plant at Dagenham, east London, and another factory making transmissions in Halewood, near\u0026nbspLiverpool.The Bridgend plant has been under threat because of falling demand for the two engines it makes\u0026nbspand lower projections for the Dragon engine it is scheduled to start making this year. It has been manufacturing engines for 40 years.\u0026nbspFord’s European profits plummeted 82 per cent last year, in part because of a fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote in June 2016.Jeff Beck, a GMB Union regional organiser, said: “Regardless of today’s announcement GMB will continue to work with Ford, our sister unions and the Welsh government to find a solution to the issue and mitigate the effects of this devastating news.“What makes it worse is Donald Trump is in this country talking about a possible trade deal between the UK and the US – yet when the plant closes the new line is likely to be produced in Mexico by an American company.”Len McCluskey, the\u0026nbspgeneral secretary of Unite the Union, said: “Ford’s decision to shut its Bridgend engine plant in 2020 is a grotesque act of economic betrayal.Car industry workers want to leave the EU“These workers and this community have stayed faithful to Ford, as have UK customers – this is still Ford’s largest European market – through thick and thin, but have been treated disgracefully in return by this company.“Ford broke promise after promise to the UK. First, it was that it would build 500,000 engines at Bridgend. That fell to a quarter of a million, then fell again and again to now just 80,000. The company has deliberately run down its UK operations so that now not a single Ford vehicle – car or van – is made in the UK.”The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “I am aware of the reports and I understand that they will be very worrying for workers at Bridgend but the reports are unconfirmed by the company so it is not appropriate for me to speculate or comment further at this time.”Carwyn Jones, a\u0026nbspformer Welsh government leader who is currently an assembly member for Bridgend, told the Press Association: “This has all been very sudden. There was no warning about this at all. It seems to me that any decision, whatever that decision is, would have been taken very recently.“From my perspective, I want to know what’s going on as to with the workers and want to know a reason for the decision, and to work with the Welsh government to see what we can do to help the workers here.“It’s the biggest single employer in the area, I remember it being built in the late Seventies. There are relatively few suppliers locally but there are a number of businesses that provide services for the plant itself and they would be severely affected because for a lot of them this is the only contract they have.”Ford announced last month it was cutting 7,000 white-collar jobs worldwide, with up to 550 expected in the UK.The US manufacturer said the cuts represented 10 per cent of its global salaried workforce and 20 per cent of its management positions.A spokesperson for Unite said: “Our priority is our members’ jobs, the communities and livelihoods in the supply chain that Ford Bridgend supports.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

From the\u0026nbsp50th anniversary of partial decriminalisation of homosexuality to the fifth anniversary of same-sex marriage, we have much to be thankful for. The impact of these achievements,\u0026nbspand the rate of change, from when I attended an all boys Cof E school at the height of Section 28,\u0026nbspis monumental. At the same time, analysis by the University of Manchester\u0026nbspin 2018, based on a National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles in 2010, concluded that British society may be reaching “peak acceptance” of LGBT lifestyle and people.\u0026nbspFrom a very early age I was expected to be a diligent, hard working, studious middle son but at school\u0026nbspI was labelled the gay boy, subjected to taunts and homophobic vitriol purely because of appearing effeminateHowever,\u0026nbspI am reminded of a recent conversation with a gay friend, who suggested that equality is a lofty ideal that is far from reality when taken at a societal level.\u0026nbspHis rhetoric was far more colourful than I can attest but he believed as\u0026nbspLGBT people we were still subjected to stereotyping because\u0026nbspwe live in a straight, heteronormative world that\u0026nbspignores and threatens our lifestyles.AFPGetty Images)In my work as Britain’s First Out Muslim Drag Queen and trans activist, I have striven for visibility and wider acceptance for the Gaysian community, from within my own community and the\u0026nbspwider society. Being of a British Pakistani heritage, I struggled to come to\u0026nbspterms with my identity, within myself and my family, and this was made doubly difficult by our obsession with labels.Lebanon blocks Grindr in latest attack on LGBT+ communityLGBT+ Muslims to lead Pride march with teacher at centre of protestsPrimary school to close early as anti-LGBT+ lesson protests escalateMalta named best destination for LGBT+ travellersThe\u0026nbspother boys saw me as an outcast, which had no grounding in truth. At this time,\u0026nbspI had no sense\u0026nbspof my own sexuality but in the course of being bullied\u0026nbspI grew to associate with the gay label. If everyone assumed the\u0026nbspyoung Asif\u0026nbspwas gay\u0026nbspthen it must be\u0026nbsptrue. Apart from being sexually attracted to boys I had no deep understanding of my sexuality or what I would, many years later, come to decipher as a differing gender identity.In these formative years I identified myself with the gay label because I\u0026nbspwas being oppressed by\u0026nbspit, which fits western stereotypes of effeminacy in boys as being a gay trait. In Pakistan and the south Asian subcontinent,\u0026nbsptrans identities have long been widely acknowledged, a world away from my British upbringing. It was only in my early thirties that I became fully aware of my trans identity and this only occurred when I stopped defining myself by societal standards.Cashman, comedian Rhona Cameron,\u0026nbspactivist Peter Tatchell and Graham Norton\u0026nbsp(Getty)I’ve had the privilege to come out twice.

At the height of the bullying I did not receive any visible support from teachers, who feared being reprimanded for going against the law.My\u0026nbspschool, with a 95 per cent majority Afro-Caribbean student body, and my British Asian ethnicity,\u0026nbsp also played a big part in my experience. The analysis by the University of Manchester found that BAME\u0026nbsppeople were more likely to hold negative views towards the LGBT community, particularly in the 1990s at the height of misinformation and fear about the HIVAids epidemic and governmental ineptitude.My mother once confided in me that she feared for my future, living as gay in a straight world. I remember thinking that she was worrying without reason but after many years of lived experience as a gay man – I do acknowledge her sentimentOne of my parents’ main fears, which guided their decision to take me to the GP and the local imam, was that I had learnt to be gay because I was exposed to it, from school, from pop culture. Their interpretation of religion and south Asian cultural expectations made them question my foundations – the “gay”\u0026nbsplabel took many years to be normalised and understood within my family unit.At the root of their concern was my happiness and safety.

So much of it still resonates. Downs argued that growing up gay in a heterosexual world results in the internalisation of shame, a shame gay men may strive to obscure with material success, creativity, beauty or more severe forms of escapist gratification like substance abuse.The chemsex phenomenon, when people take drugs that enhance sex and make them feel uninhibited, has become a prominent subculture within the LGBT community, which has led to the UK’s criminal and health bodies formulating policy. From personal experience I struggled with my LGBT identity and my role within a greater society.Asifa Lahore: ‘I struggled with my intersectionality as a gay, British, Asian, Muslim’ (Christine Hayter)Being of south Asian heritage and effeminate prevented me from being taken seriously. Fresh out of\u0026nbspthe Brit school, these loaded labels were a burden and affected my emotional wellbeing. After years of suppressing my creativity and personal growth, in a career that satisfied my traditional parents,\u0026nbspI created my drag alter ego Asifa Lahore –\u0026nbspmy decision to deviate from the rigid gender norm and toxic masculinity\u0026nbspI had been subjected to,\u0026nbspconsciously and subconsciously.Through Asifa Lahore,\u0026nbspI was able to express myself creatively in a physical form that better fitted society’s understanding of what was expected of an effeminate gay man. Through Asifa Lahore the drag queen, I found an art form that allowed me to subvert societal norms. But in a perverted way I was giving in to my critics, who expected that of me\u0026nbspas an effeminate gay man that\u0026nbspputting on a dress and wig would make more sense.The second time I came out, this time as a transgender woman, I felt freedom like I have never experienced before. Even as I became fully aware of my loss of male privilege and the benefits that come attached to that I felt emblazoned to live as open and authentically as I couldPerforming at cabaret venues and events throughout Britain, I would be heartbroken by the lack of POC faces in the audience, not because they don’t exist but primarily because they don’t feel they belong in these primarily gay, white spaces. The LGBT scene has become more erse but it is still very whitewashed and, arguably, has\u0026nbspracist undertones. Many POC LGBT people complain\u0026nbspof being turned away from prominent gay clubs for not looking or sounding “gay”\u0026nbspenough.I struggled with my intersectionality as a gay, British, Asian, Muslim. I\u0026nbspcouldn’t find a way to allow all these identities to co-exist. One of my first forays into the gay clubbing scene in the early Noughties resulted in a memorable conversation with a fellow clubber, a young white gay man who felt propelled to ask how I,\u0026nbspas a gay, brown Muslim man, could be dancing to Kylie. It was this and many other confrontations like these that led me to delve into my identity.Chutney queens is\u0026nbspan affectionate umbrella term used to describe drag queens who adhere to a Bollywood inspired, culturally south Asian aesthetic. Surrounded by these gregarious clubbers I felt accounted for. I belonged. Such safe spaces exist out of necessity, the need to feel represented.\u0026nbspI have opened my own club night, ‘Disco Rani’, which is a monthly Bollywood and Banghra club night that functions as a safe space for a wide cross-section of Gaysians.Similarly, we have seen a growth in BAME\u0026nbspPrides and events that commemorate our differences, supported by Stonewall but frowned upon by the old guard that question its necessity and the\u0026nbspfragmentation of the LGBT community. The harsh reality is that more work needs to be done to increase visibility and representation of all the peoples that make up the LGBT community and until then these Prides are needed.The second time I came out, this time as a transgender woman, I felt freedom like I have never experienced before. Even as I became fully aware of my loss of male privilege and the benefits that come attached to that I felt emblazoned to live as open and authentically as I could.LGBT activists\u0026nbspdemonstrate against the Supreme Court’s reinstatement of\u0026nbspSection 377, which bans gay sex in a law dating from India’s colonial era (AFPGetty)As annual Pride celebrations begin in earnest I reflect on the importance of such events. Prides are an essential part of our celebration as LGBTQ+ people and now more than ever we must continue to show up and not forget our history. Rights that are long fought for can as quickly be taken away.Visibility must continue, especially in the current climate of the Parkfield school protests and the debate of LGBT education. Such a debate highlights the fact that –\u0026nbspfor all the legal rights and privileges the LGBT community has acquired – more needs to be done. Same sex relationships deserve acknowledgement on equal footing to heteronormative relationships. Visibility is one way to ensure our presence. As Marsha P Johnson did and as Peter Tatchell and Janet Mock continue to do, so we must stand up and make ourselves heard.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That could include film crews, for instance, who could be allowed to make ads or whole films in space.The first space tourists could head up to the ISS in 2020, Nasa said.The plans allow private companies to lease out time on Nasa\u0027s part of the International Space Station. They will also be able to borrow its own astronauts for their commercial work, and take their technologies to the floating lab – though they are expected to pay heavy prices for the opportunity.Nasa has long been resistant to the idea of commercialising its operations, including the ISS.

It hopes that private industry can develop the space technologies of the future, and help with its plans to return to the Moon in 2024, taking the first ever woman and the first person in decades.The moon is shrinking and shaking, Nasa saysNasa hopes that the missions help test out and encourage future private missions into space, which could provide funding for further exploration in years to come.The space agency will keep using the ISS as a place for research and testing in low-Earth orbit, doing work that will help contribute towards its plans to head to the Moon, it said. But it will also work with the private sector to allow it to use the ISS to test technologies, train astronauts and encourage the development of the space economy, it said.Nasa will also help develop a whole host of private spacecraft, floating around above the Earth, that can serve as a home for people, Nasa said.The tourists\u0026nbsp– whom\u0026nbspNasa refers to as private astronauts – will go on missions of up to 30 days. While there they will perform duties that can include commercial and marketing activity, which will be limited by Nasa\u0027s rules.There can be two of those short-duration missions each year, Nasa said. They will go on privately funded, dedicated spaceflights that will use a US spacecraft, developed under Nasa\u0027s plan to encourage the private sector to build new spacecraft.The private astronauts will still have to pass Nasa\u0027s medical standards and the training procedures to ensure they are safe on board the ISS.Eventually, private companies could use floating habitations like the ISS to stop off at on their way to further destinations deeper in the solar system.Nasa\u0027s decision to open up the space station comes as a variety of companies start to offer the possibility of space tourism in the future. Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX, for instance, will send a Japanese billionaire and eight artists around the Moon in a private mission slated for 2023.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So allow me to make it here, because it’s actually a very good idea.Those concerns about overcrowded, creaking commuter trains are real: but they cannot be solved without HS2, or something extremely similar. The problem is that explaining why is quite complicated, so politicians haven’t really tried.Some people seem to think HS2 is about “knocking 35 minutes off London to Birmingham”. It isn’t. Yes, it will dramatically reduce journey times: the whole project will cut London-Manchester from\u0026nbsptwo\u0026nbsphours to one it takes around an hour off the journey to Scotland Birmingham to Newcastle is cut from three\u0026nbsphours 15 minutes down to two hours. Birmingham to Nottingham, which currently takes over an hour, falls to an almost ridiculous 19 minutes.

The objective is capacity, and not just capacity for fast intercity services, either, but for those local regional and commuter services between small towns that have been so neglected. The complicated bit is explaining why that is.Britain’s railways were largely built in the Victorian era, for a different kind of travel. Today, the same lines carry a mix of express intercity trains – the kind which HS2 will take – and stopping local and commuter services, the kind people use to get to work, or pop to a neighbouring town.The colossal HS2 bill could cost the north its much-needed railwayThis mix is a very inefficient way to run a railway, for a reason that is quite obvious if you think about it: trains cannot overtake each other on the same set of tracks. They would bang into the back of one another if they tried. Not good. To get around this, local stopping trains need a large gap behind them in the timetable, so the express trains behind them do not catch up. That reduces the number of trains you can have per hour on a line, dramatically reducing its capacity for every type of service – local and express.The engineering thinking behind HS2 is to take those express services off the older mainlines, leaving them for stopping local and commuter services. When trains are all travelling at roughly the same speed on a line, you can fit a lot more in, because the gaps needed between them are smaller.HS2 will take express trains off the West Coast Main Line that links London with Birmingham and the cities of the northwest the Midland Main Line that links London with the East Midlands and Sheffield and to an extent the East Coast Main Line that goes up to Leeds and Newcastle. That frees up capacity across a huge swathe of the country for local services, and it’s the whole rationale behind the project. That the government hasn’t been explaining this ad nauseum is inexcusable.So if the plan is to improve commuter services, why not build a new commuter line instead of a new one for expresses? It wouldn’t make sense: these existing lines are already good for slow trains, and they go into the centres of towns and cities, which have since expanded around them. A new high-speed line for expresses can make use of engineering advances since the 19th century to speed up journeys, and doesn’t have to go into as many built up areas as a local line would, where the need for tunnelling and demolitions would make it more expensive and disruptive. And making a line high-speed doesn’t actually cost that much more, either, if you’re building one anyway. But the key point is that local services benefit, despite the new line being for express trains.HS2 will also bring other direct benefits to cities and towns that aren’t London. Northern Powerhouse Rail (stupid name) is the government’s plan to connect up the cities of the north of England with high-speed rail. It’s currently in development, but the plan, as put together by northern councils, relies on vast sections of HS2 track. Liverpool to Manchester Sheffield to Leeds and towards York and Newcastle – these bits of NPR will use parts of HS2.The government arguably made a huge mistake by starting planning on the NPR scheme so late, leaving people wondering why they were prioritising journeys to London – but with Labour and the Conservatives both committed to the project, it is likely to happen. HS2 and better connections between non-London cities aren’t an eitheror: the two projects are intrinsically linked. If HS2 is scrapped, who knows when a government will next be brave enough to try a major rail project again.In the meantime, the West Coast Main Line is filling up, and can’t wait. The reason ticket prices are a rip-off from\u0026nbspLondon to Manchester (£175 for a walk-up, one-way, anytime ticket is absurd no matter what cheap advance fares are available – sometimes you just have to travel) is because the trains are running completely full and Virgin can charge what they like and still have a passenger in every seat – and sometimes the floor. The number of passengers using the route doubled between 1997 and 2005, and it is well on its way to doubling again. The huge capacity increase that HS2 brings is a response to that.It’s understandable that people are sceptical of a project that has been badly explained, when it isn’t obvious why it deals with the biggest problems they see with the railways. That said, some criticisms are red herrings. Take the environmental impact: over the 140 miles of HS2 line, 29 hectares of ancient woodland will be felled. Sounds bad? But for comparison, a single 2.5-mile road scheme, widening the A21 in Kent and Sussex (not even a new road!), will take down nine hectares, around a third of HS2’s phase 1 total. Extinction Rebellion are barking up the wrong tree on this one far more road schemes will be needed if we can’t shift traffic to more efficient rail, and that means building more capacity. High-speed rail has also proven the greenest way to get people off short-haul flights, dominating routes like London-Paris or Madrid-Barcelona, where polluting planes would otherwise be king. Long term, it’s good for the environment. And new trees are being planted elsewhere to replace the ones cut down.Why does Britain keep making a mess of its biggest projects?Lords report recommends HS2 rethink as costs spiral ‘out of control’HS2 accused of poor planning and ‘unacceptable’ damage to wildlifeExtinction Rebellion activists camp out in trees to protest HS2‘Thousands’ of trees die on HS2 route for lack of waterAny large project will be disruptive, but compared to the other options, HS2 is actually pretty good. Consider one much-touted alternative: upgrading the West Coast Main Line with an extra pair of tracks for more capacity. There are several thousands houses built facing onto the line, and you’re going to need to knock them down to put a railway there. And it won’t be high-speed, it’ll be more expensive to do it, and it’ll be massively disruptive – not just for people losing their homes, but passengers who would face about a decade of closures and replacement buses. The more general problem with suggestions that existing lines should simply be “upgraded” (a rather vague proposal) is that there are simply diminishing returns to what you can do with 150-year old infrastructure. The West Coast Main Line already benefited from a major upgrade programme ending in 2005 it took a decade of disruption and cost over £10bn in today’s money, provided only a fraction of the benefits of HS2, and is already full. Plans to upgrade it further were abandoned because they weren’t seen as practical, and planning for a new line that became HS2 is a direct result of that process.Will HS2 suffer from cost overruns? Probably. Delays? You bet. Infrastructure projects are rarely delivered on time anywhere in the world, not least in western democracies with little things like rule of law and environmental regulation. But once they are finally delivered, nobody cares: you probably don’t even remember that the Channel Tunnel or Jubilee Line extension were fiascos in their time nobody would get rid of them now. HS2 will be the same. It won’t solve every problem with the UK’s rail network, but it is a necessary part of solving a hell of a lot of them. If it gets scrapped, in 10 years’ time people will be talking about building something very similar, and moaning that we didn’t get on with it when we had the chance. Probably while they sit on the floor of an overcrowded train.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s why we support a Final Say on BrexitAnd they challenged the invocation of wartime patriotism by the Leave camp, pointing out that it was Sir Winston Churchill who called for the creation of a “European family” to prevent another descent into bloodshed.Churchill’s words helped inspire the creation of the Common Market, which evolved into the European Union with “one main purpose - to create lasting peace by entwining our economies and societies together on a continent once ravaged by war,” they said.“Nato does not keep the peace in Europe – it keeps peace for Europe.

Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.As the overwhelming favourite among the party membership, Boris Johnson is relying on his charisma to walk his way to the highest position in government. While there is a growing Stop Boris collective of Tory MPs, many in the party believe that he is the only candidate who could win a general election. He insists that Britain must leave the EU on October 31 with or without a deal.Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, is the most direct opposition to frontrunner Boris Johnson similarly inclined to a hard Brexit but not as controversial among Tory MPs. He would seek a new, fairer deal, though he insists that Britain must leave the EU by October 31. Raab announced his bid on Sunday 26 May, 2 days after the Prime Minister announced her departure date.Michael Gove, the environment secretary,  is leaning on his extensive government experience, having served in 3 cabinet roles since 2010, to make the case that he is suited to lead. His greatest challenge may prove to be convincing MPs and members to trust him as he earned a bad reputation for standing against Boris Johnson in the 2016 leadership contest after starting the race as Johnson\u0027s campaign manager.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, was the first cabinet member to announce his bid just hours after the Prime Minister declared her departure date. He supported the Prime Minister\u0027s deal when she tried to get it through parliament and is pitching himself as the candidate to unite the Tory party.Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, is somewhat of an outsider, he only joined the cabinet for the first time at the beginning of May. He is pitching himself as the sensible candidate, drawing on his unique diplomatic experience and pledging to rule out both a second referendum and a no-deal Brexit. He has caught attention on social media for his campaigning approachEsther Mcvey, the former work and pensions secretary, is standing on a hard Brexit promise. She suggests that the EU ought to approach Britain with a better deal and pledges to step-up preparations for a no-deal Brexit.Sajid Javid, the home secretary, intends to stand for unity in a United Kingdom. He pledges to restore trust in politics by delivering Brexit. He has served in two cabinet positions in May\u0027s government, first as housing secretary before replacing Amber Rudd as home secretary, a role in which he garnered controversy over his declaration of a major incident when around 40 migrants attempted to cross the channel in small boats.Andrea Leadsom, the former leader of the house of commons, is pitching herself as the party unity candidate. Speaking to Sky News as she announced her bid, Leadsom claimed to be a decisive and compassionate leader.

Mr Grieve lost a no-confidence vote in his Buckinghamshire constituency by 182 votes to 131 in March, saying at the time that he appeared to be the victim of “an orchestrated and organised campaign” by Brexiteers.In a statement posted on Twitter, the chairman of the Beaconsfield\u0026nbspConstituency Conservative Association, Jackson Ng, said: “I understand that there are feelings of disappointment, anger and frustration from many of our membership.“Therefore, following this evening’s special general meeting and on behalf of our executive council, I have immediately written to our MP Dominic Grieve QC to formally request that he now submits a written application to us to seek his re-adoption as our parliamentary candidate for the next general election expected in 2022.”Local Tory member Dylan Kenny said in a tweet: “It was heartening that everyone spoke respectfully and with dignity. Dominic made an impassioned and highly intelligent speech. I am glad there was no animosity and the association should be proud of the conduct of this evening’s discourse.”Mr Grieve’s application for reselection as candidate would be subject to a secret ballot of the local association’s executive council. If he loses the vote, he can request a ballot of members in the constituency or put himself up against other candidates seeking to fight the seat.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He repeated his claim that he could have secured a deal if he had been “backed up” by others in government.And he said: “All candidates should be honest about their plans and be subject to scrutiny, because it’s a test of nerve here, and if candidates can’t stand up (for) their resolve to lead us out by the end of October in a leadership contest, what chance would they have in the heat of negotiations in Brussels?”Asked whether he would serve in a government led by Mr Johnson, Mr Raab said: “Of course. It would depend slightly on what was being offered – you have got to be willing, able and good at doing the job you have been offered.“I have turned down jobs before because I didn’t think I was the best person to do it.

With concern mounting that the crowded field – which at one point reached 13 contenders – would mean a long and unwieldy election period, Committee officials last week announced a new format designed to cull no-hopers early in the process.Candidates now require the nominations of eight other MPs to stand, rather than the proposer and seconder demanded in previous contests.In a first ballot of Conservative MPs on 13 June, candidates with fewer than 17 votes will be eliminated.\u0026nbspIf all receive 17 or more votes, the least popular goes\u0026nbspout. If there is a tie for last place, officials will speak to the two candidates involved to see whether both should drop out or the ballot be re-run.A second ballot will be held on 18 June, with candidates needing 33 votes or more to survive. Again, if all pass the threshold, the one at the bottom of the list will be removed.By this point, the field should have been considerably narrowed, and further rounds of voting will take place on the following days in the hope of producing a final two by Thursday 20 JuneBetween each ballot, intensive horse-trading can be expected in Westminster as the surviving candidates seek to poach one another’s supporters and hoover up the backers of eliminated candidates.The final two contenders will go through to a postal ballot of an estimated 160,000 party members around the country in July, with the result currently expected in the week of 22 July.It emerged on Thursday that there is no guarantee the new leader’s name will be announced before parliament breaks up for its summer recess, potentially denying the opposition an opportunity to test whether he or she can command a majority in the House of Commons as prime minister.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The average selling price of a property across the UK in May was £237,837 after a 0.5 per cent month-to-month rise.Experts cautioned that Halifax’s index had been an “outlier” in recent months and that other house price measures have consistently pointed to a slowdown, particularly in London and the southeast of England.\u0026nbspNationwide reported that house prices fell 0.2 per cent between April and May and\u0026nbsprose\u0026nbspjust 0.6 per cent over the year.Created with Sketch.

But it hasn’t stopped since then: buoyed by the momentum of their new MEPs, ecologists are making further gains.In Germany, the latest poll shows the country’s Greens practically neck-and-neck with Angela Merkel’s conservatives, who have dominated the country’s politics for well over a decade. With the governing coalition facing a rough patch, there’s even talk that fresh early elections could put the ecologists in charge at the head of a centre-left alliance.Other countries are also seeing ecologists get in on power. In Finland, the Greens are a key part of the new governing coalition, formed on Thursday, and have even taken over the country’s foreign ministry. There are gains in places like Ireland, France and Belgium too. In Britain, they are doing as well as they have ever done in the polls for Westminster, fresh from doubling their MEPs last month.It’s worth a note of caution: public opinion can be fickle, and Green parties have surged before. Back in the 1989 European elections, Greens won 14 per cent of the vote in the UK. They didn’t quite get established as a major political force, but much of their policy and rhetoric was integrated into the big parties’ programmes out of fear they might be displaced.But there are good reasons to think that their politics will stick\u0026nbsparound this time, and that climate change might be getting the focus in our politics that it deserves – despite rows about Brexit dominating media coverage over the last few years.\u0026nbspGreens poised to overtake Angela Merkel’s conservatives in pollsThe German Greens will shape the future of all EuropeHow European newspapers reacted to the EU election resultsIn a way, the idea that “we don’t pay enough attention to climate change”\u0026nbsphas become a powerful political idea in itself – it is self evidently true, and a powerful recruiting tool for ecologist movements and green parties, who give the issue the time it deserves. \u0026nbspThe recent Extinction Rebellion protests\u0026nbspand associated climate change school strikes, which have sprung up across Europe – and play off this very idea – have massively raised public consciousness of environmental issues to never-before-seen levels.\u0026nbspA YouGov poll series of UK voters’ unprompted political concerns shows those mentioning the environment as an issue rising slowly and steadily from 2016 onwards, and then spiking after the Extinction Rebellion protests started in 2019 to 27 per cent. The spike surpassed a previous short-lived spike to 24 per cent during serious winter flooding and storms in 2014.If there are two things we can expect more of, it’s extreme weather and climate protests. If those things drive concern about the environment, that’s fertile soil for ecologist politics.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man walks past a billboard showing members of the French women\u0027s World Cup football team on the side of a building on the Champs-Elysees avenue in Paris.

In Britain, Labour has already made a Green New Deal, and similar programmes are being promoted by left-wing Democrats in the US without much interference from third parties. However that change comes about, it looks like concern about the climate is finally getting the kind of attention it needs in the developed world.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She had that very self-satisfied expression on her face.Then to stop the interviewer, Piers Morgan, asking her dficult questions, she started gabbling idiocies at  words per second. Like a maling Chatty Cathy doll. It was hilarious. Jabber The Hutt.She made no sense whatsoever. She appeared deranged.Thornberry is the best Labour has to offer. She is easily the most persuasive and talented member of Magic Grandpa’s frontbench. Yes, sure, that isn’t saying much. But here she was utterly lost.And you could see, as she wittered on, the end in sight for a great political party. One I was proud to be a member of for  years. A party which was once great, but now makes no sense whatsoever. A party suffused with hypocrisy.Thornberry was trying to explain why Jeremy Corbyn and the party were so hostile to Donald Trump. And she had no answer. How could she, when Corbyn is happy to call terrorists his friends — but has no time for the democratically elected leader of the free world When Corbyn and his cronies offer support for Socialist catastrophes such as Venezuela. Or totalitarian dictatorships such as Cuba, where trade unionists and homosexuals are imprisoned.Under Corbyn Labour has become a party of educationally challenged, far-left, perpetual adolescents, hostile not only to all of Britain’s allies but to Britain itself. It no longer represents the working class it was set up to protect. If it represents anyone at all it is the affluent, virtue-signalling, metropolitan middle class. And even they are drting away from Labour, appalled by its rank anti-Semitism.This genuinely could be the end of Labour. Despite the worst Government in living memory, it still struggles to hold a lead in the polls. In the Euro elections it was beaten out of sight by the Lib Dems and lost ten seats. Unheard of for the official opposition party! It’s only a matter of time before the Greens overtake Labour.Labour dumped the working class because it thought it could rely on the host of tribes in the UK, some of whom consider themselves victims. Gays, transgender people, Muslims, feminists, black and ethnic minorities.But the trouble is, those supposed “victims” do not agree with each other, or wish to be portrayed as victims.Some radical feminists don’t like the transgender activists, some Muslims don’t have much time for the gays or the feminists. So the whole thing has fallen apart. And it has fallen apart because it is based on a fallacy.Some Labour MPs have already deserted the party to join the hilarious Change UK.They would have been better off joining the Lib Dems. Other decent Labour MPs — Kate Hoey, Frank Field, Caroline Flint — soldier on in the hope that Magic Grandpa will one day be gone. They’ve been hoping that for four years, but there’s no sign of it happening. The truth is, the party is lost to them.Many commentators have suggested that Brexit may see the end of the Tory Party.So it might. But more surely, it will see the end of the Labour Party. It is ideologically bankrupt. It has outlived its useful purpose.THE Brexit Party looks set to win today’s important by-election in Peterborough.People are rightly furious that the liberal establishment and the major parties have effectively thwarted the people’s will. They want to teach Labour and the Conservatives a lesson.I voted for Nigel Farage’s party in the Euro elections – but I wouldn’t dream of doing so in Peterborough.They have no policies, other than Brexit. And their candidate is making stuff up on the hoof. Champagne for everyone! This is utterly dishonest.The truth Nigel and Co are not telling voters is that the Brexit Party is deeply hostile to the working class.Farage has talked about privatising the NHS. He has no time for nationalising our energy companies, or decreasing the ide between rich and poor in our country.OK, I’m biased – as you can see from the above photo. Butyou are a Leave voter but care about social equality too, there’s only one candidate to vote for in Peterborough – Patrick O’Flynn of the SDP.CONGRATS to Peter Crouch and Abbey Clancy on the birth of their baby boy.Crouchie joked the kid would be called Divock Samrat, after the Liverpool striker Origi and his favourite curry house.Abbey’s not having it, though.So here’s a thought – what about Roderick  Nobody calls their kids Roderick any more.Actually, nobody ever did, apart from my mum and dad. And I was lucky, it was almost Sebastian.THE Conservative Party is dying on its feet. But there are still plenty of munchkins who fancy being its boss.There were a dozen candidates until Tuesday, when one bloke I’ve never heard of pulled out.Several more people nobody has heard of fancy a go. Boris Johnson is favourite, of course – but the Tories are weird people and rarely,ever, choose the front runner.If they’re sensible they’ll go for someone who is actually conservative – someone like Esther McVey. Or Priti Patelshe chucks her hat in the ring.C’mon Priti, everybody  seems to be having a go.LOUIS Farrakhan is a foul piece of work.A vile Muslim rabble rouser from the United States and deeply anti-semitic. He has described Judaism as a “gutter religion”.He has called Jewish people “bloodsuckers”. And he described Adolf Hitler as being a “great man.”So who would defend a piece of crap like this  Who would say of him: “Mr Farrakhan is not anti-Semitic and does not preach a message of racial hatred and antagonism” Step right up – Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor, and the man who has spent the last couple of years flinging insults at Donald Trump.You know where you are with the Labour Party, don’t you Always available to support Jew-haters or anyone who despises our culture and way of le.Always available to be contemptuous of our friends and allies.DID you see the face of that woman protesting about Donald Trump’s visit She is called Siobhan and screamed “Nazi!” at a bloke who was supporting the US President.It was a face contorted with hatred, full of rage and spite. Just because someone disagreed with her. Everyone who disagrees with her is a Nazi. Only she is right.Siobhan has since apologised, kind of. But it cuts no ice with me. Nor was I surprised she worked in the NHS. It’s always nurses and teachers – the public sector – who are out on these fatuous demos, week in, week out.They’re the only people who have time to go on them.THOROUGHLY enjoyed Sky and HBO’s series Chernobyl.It was a great reminder of the sheer grimness, ineptitude and brutality of the old Soviet Union.As we now know, the reactor at Chernobyl had a flawed design. But layers of bureaucracy and Communist Party bullying prevented the experts from doing anything about it.Mind you, it is worth remembering that this was by far and away the worst ever disaster at a nuclear plant, anywhere. And the number of dead Just . When it happened the anti-nuclear lobby predicted hundreds of thousands of later deaths from cancers. This does not seem to have happened at all. The second worst ever nuclear catastrophe  The one in Fukushima, Japan, in . Total number of deaths from radiation  At the very most – just one, and that is disputed.Nuclear power is by far and away the safest means of generating electricity.More people have died building or maintaining wind turbines than have died as the consequence of nuclear powerTHE slightly odd Brexit Party MEP Ann Widdecombe has said that “science might provide an answer” to being gay.I’m not entirely sure what Widders means, or what medication she was on when she said it.Anyway, she was booked to do a one-woman show in Ilfracombe, Devon. But the boss of the company staging the show has sacked her.David Hutchinson, a virtue- signalling idiot who can only tolerate opinions which concur with his own, said he was “disgusted” by Widdecombe’s comments.Well sure, maybe. And that means that people who might have a dferent point of view to yours should not be allowed to talk to the public  This story is about a bigot. And the bigot isn’t Widdecombe.The best way to counteract this sort of fascistic intolerance is to hit them where it hurts. Hutchinson runs a company called Selladoor. So, here’s a suggestion. Don’t attend any of its events.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Can Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party win this core Middle Britain seat Dficult, but it would be a heck of a result and could do to those insects in Westminster what a dose of Sarson’s does to the winged pests that erupt from house walls on hot days.EvenFarage does not pull off a cup upset in Peterborough, Westminster is starting to get jumpy. About time, too! Theresa May quits the Tory leadership tomorrow and the race to succeed her has begun with almost as many runners as the Grand National.Quite a few of them will end up in the glue factory.Prince Charles’s pro-EU pal Rory Stewart, the little-known International Development Secretary, has made a wonderful fool of himself by standing for the job. Stewart has filmed selfie videos presenting himself as man-of-the-masses, in places such as, er, genteel Kew Gardens.Deluded commentators in the Westminster village have praised his social-media “outreach”. It’s the political elite’s echo chamber at work again.On Tuesday evening Stewart stood on a box at Speaker’s Corner in London’s Hyde Park, to “speak to the people”. What a gumby. The only bystanders at Speaker’s Corner these days are tourists, ice-cream vendors and a few winos.If Stewart really wants to meet the people to see what they think of his plan to soften Brexit to the point of non-existence, he should haul himself off to somewhere like Asda in Walsall, in the West Midlands.Brummies would soon let him know exactly what they thought of his proposal to ignore the  referendum’s .million Leave voters.Meanwhile, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock , polished his credentials to be Tory leader by releasing a video of himself playing office cricket with a few of his civil servants. I had to watch this stunt twice just to make sure it wasn’t a spoof from Armando Iannucci, one of the sharp comic brains behind Alan Partridge.Not that Hancock is the silliest of the bunch. Sam Gyimah, an obscure former junior minister, was last night persisting with his leadership campaign even though he did not have the declared support of a single MP .This was almost pathetic in the proper sense of the word — ie enough to make you feel sad for the bloke. But in the end I’m afraid my heart remained unmoved. Gyimah simply looked a prat.Labour’s comrades are at each other’s throats, the Lib Dems have their own leadership contestand the Change UK brigade, just a few weeks after their creation, are disintegrating like one of strongman Geoff Capes’s deckchairs. More than half of them quit, leaving a rump that will be led by spluttering Anna Soubry, as shouty as a Jack Russell snapping at a postie’s ankles.All this was happening while Hurricane Trump blew into town and gave half-pint London Mayor Sadiq Khan a few home truths. The President also showed Jeremy Corbyn to be two-faced, revealing that Corbyn — who happily joined a rally where Trump was slandered as a fascist — had begged him for a one-to-one meeting. The crawler.Looking at this turmoil, you might think: “That’s it, I’m emigrating to strong, stable Venezuela.” Don’t book your ticket to Caracas just yet.Call me a crazy optimist, but I think the mayhem in our politics is healthy — a sign that it’s finally sinking into Westminster’s blockheads that they need to start reflecting and stop blocking public opinion.Theresa May first. The PM’s departure was so often predicted that it is hard to believe she and husband Philip are finally emptying their smalls drawers at No.But after her tearful announcement two weeks ago in Downing Street, there is no way back for Madam Glumbucket. A nation mourns  Don’t let’s put it that strongly but nor should we gloat.Allow her a decent adieu. She occupied high office with dignity and seriousness and was not tacky, like some recent PMs. There was no Carole Caplin or Lord Levy in her coterie, thank goodness.If that was an example of politicians learning from their predecessors’ mistakes, might the same be happening with the EU crisis  Tory and Labour MPs have been terried by the rise of Farage’s Brexit Party.Peterborough was a swing seat won by Labour in  by now-disgraced Fiona Onasanya, jailed after trying to cheat a motoring offence.Whatever the result, the Peterborough campaign showed that neither of the two main parties can take Middle Britain for granted.That has made northern Labour MPs wary of seeking a second referendum. And it has caused a big change in the Tory leadership election campaign.Front-runner Boris Johnson and his main rivals Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt, Dominic Raab and Sajid Javid are all being much more ballsy about a No Deal Brexit.The three Remain candidates — Hancock, Stewart and Gyimah — are trailing badly. It is hard to say who will win but , as likely, it is Boris, Gove or Raab, the next PM should be much more in tune with public opinion.Meanwhile, the determinedly anti-Brexit Tory MP Phillip Lee looks doomed after a row with his activists in Bracknell. The people are revolting!With an opinion poll having now suggested that the Brexit Party may have a national lead, MPs on both sides of the Commons are finally clocking the possibility that they could lose their seats.Ouch. That’s the sting of vinegar in their eyes. It’s the only remedy for their arrogance. Folks, keep squirting. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The rest must do so now.THERE is a lesson for some younger Royals from Donald Trump’s memorable State Visit.We have no ideathe Queen, Charles or Camilla liked him. That’s the point.For three days they rolled out the red carpet, charmed the world’s most powerful man and treated him and his we to the pomp and pageantry we excel at.The President loved it. And the older Royals, regardless of personal likes or dislikes, honoured his country and his historic role with grace and humour.They did their job, and put to shame the tantrums of the Left and our staggeringly unprofessional Commons Speaker.The result  Trump has never felt closer to our country.Barack Obama sneered that we would be “at the back of the queue” for a trade dealwe dared to vote Leave.His Remainer fans loved stating it as fact.But we did vote Leave, and Obama’s successor can’t wait now to get cracking on it.Maybe someone should prosecute those Remainers for “lying”. It’s all the rage.WE rarely agree with Philip Hammond. But he’s right about the folly of blindly committing to “net zero” emissions within  years.Every gas boiler and cooker, and every petrol and diesel vehicle, scrapped.A nationwide blizzard of charging points. Far less meat in our diet. And much .We doubt the Chancellor’s £trillion cost estimate — but evenit’s half, that’s money we cannot spend on health, schools or police.What is the Government doing to convince the public this is a good idea We all want a cleaner world, but what happens when services are slashed to fund it The eco lobby predicts a huge pricewe FAIL to act. But UK emissions are a minuscule fraction of the global total.Voters won’t back this revolution unless every other major country — many far worse polluters than us — does too.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the party has let us down and I will be voting for the Brexit Party during the European elections.”But it wasn’t just her political opinions that gained her admirers.Racy snaps of Emily posing in her bikini on holiday and wearing figure-hugging dresses on nights out have also caught the eye.But now the teen worries the racy snaps could count against her as she set sights on a career in politics.Emily, an influencer for turning Point UK, said: “When I went to Ibiza I did post an Instagram photo like everyone , in my bikini. And I thinkI was to become a politician that would be used against me.She added: “I do understand that MPs are very much in the public eye, people are interested in their past, but I think generally I am quite careful of things that I do, and how that could impact my future career.“I just think in future, would I be happy for someone to find out about that  And I think thats something everyone should take.”"},{"url":null,"title":"beds bacteria chimpanzees neumonia gonorrhoea meningitis","story":"Unwashed sheets and duvet covers contain more bacteria than our  ape friends’ beds.The linen collects bugs which can cause appendicitis, cellulitis, pneumonia,  gonorrhoea and meningitis.One nasty found by biologists can cause Lemierre’s syndrome, a potentially deadly infection of the jugular vein.

I’m the happiest I’ve ever been.”Roy scooped £.million in July  and splashed out on a six-bedroom mansion.The  acre property, in Barnoldby-le-Beck, Lincs, came with its own fishing lake.Roy added a ft indoor swimming pool with his winning numbers , , , ,  and  tiled into the bottom.He also spent £, on racehorse Red Lion, bought new motors with personal number plates and travelled the world.But Roy’s high-rolling lestyle ended after splitting from his second we, Darlene Shand, , in .

Investigators secretly filmed her playing at the Amery Unionist Bowling Club in Coppice Lane, Willenhall on September , . Prosecutor Jamie Scott said Peach made fraudulent claims between  and . Peach, who has no previous convictions, had claimed she was in severe pain while walking, was regularly forced to stop and needed two crutches. She told officials she never went out alone, needed help to cook and dress herself and had pain in her legs, knees and back.  But the court heard she played bowls up to four times a week and represented teams in several local leagues in Wolverhampton and South Staffordshire. After the case, a DWP spokesperson said: Only a small minority of benefit claimants are dishonest, but cases like this show how we are catching those who cheat the system and ert taxpayersapos money from the people who need it. We are determined to catch those we suspect of fraudulently claiming benefits by following up on tip-offs, undertaking surveillance and working with local councils.

Stewart Davenport lives with his partner and their eight children and step children, aged between one and , in an over-crowded house with only three beds. Conditions are so cramped that five of the children have to share one room between them. The huge family has been living in the cramped house, in Rose Hill, Oxford, since . And conditions could soon get worse when the family welcomes its th member in September. But they hope to find a new, bigger home to live in before their eldest child has a baby of her own in September.    The family are now desperate to be moved to a bigger house following years of living in a house thataposs too small. Mr Davenport said: We have a mattress which we have to drag downstairs every night and we sleep in the front room. Five of the kids have to share one room but they get scared and come down to us so weaposre often all in the same room together. We had to have an ambulance come a few months ago and the paramedics couldnapost believe that there were so many people sleeping in the same place. Things have got so bad, according to Mr Davenport, that the childrenaposs sleep is suffering and they are doing badly at school. He built a conservatory himself in the back garden to give the family more space but the council ordered it to be demolished down because it was erected without planning permission.    He said: We have to keep all their clothes in boxes on the landing because there is no room for wardrobes in the bedrooms. They canapost have any of their toys and games out because there is no space. Their studies are suffering because thereaposs nowhere to sit quietly and read. They have never got their own space and their behaviour is getting worse. The family has attempted to exchange their council house with another family - but the Davenports allege that potential takers are deterred by the roadaposs reputation as a crime hotspot. After the introduction of universal credit, they are all survive on just £ a month.    This week, it looked as though Oxford City Council may have found them a sufficiently large house. But, after seeing a series of similar opportunities fall through over the years, Mr Davenport said the celebrations have been put on hold. Last month it was announced that the local authorityaposs budget for new housing could soar next year to £.million. Stephen Clarke, head of housing services, said: “We don’t comment on inidual cases, but we are working with a number of families in overcrowded accommodation to find long term answers to their housing problems. These could include building extensions to existing homes or helping people move to a larger home. While we empathise with the dficulty a family may face living in an overcrowded home, there are no quick fixes and finding a sustainable solution takes time.

Kirsty Adjei-Mensah’s le was changed for ever after a get-together for drinks in her mate Susan Robson’s garden. She was being walked home by Robson’s husband when her friend became suspicious. Robson, , followed them into a nearby lane and believed they had been or were about to kiss.    Kirsty insists she was mistaken, saying he had only given her a “peck on the cheek”. But Robson launched such a ferocious flurry of punches and kicks that Kirsty heard her neck break. She thought she was about to die. Even today,  months after the sickening assault, Kirsty, , is haunted by flashbacks, has post-traumatic stress and is suicidal. She struggles to make new friends and has only  per cent movement in her neck. And she can no longer work in her former role as a customer services adviser.    Robson admitted GBH with intent and was sentenced last month to four years. In an exclusive interview with the Sunday People, Kirsty said: “I remember the sound of my neck snapping when she kicked me in the face. I thought I was going to die.” Now she has four scars, at the front and back of her head, where a halo brace to ­support her neck and spine was screwed in. Kirsty said: “The flashbacks kept me awake at night. That was the worst. I couldn’t see a way out of the pain and I wanted it all to end. “The only thing that stopped me was my daughter. I have terrible anxiety and PTSD. I find it hard to leave the house.” Her injuries mean she cannot stand or sit for too long.    But instead of people ­sympathising with her, she has became a target of hate since Robson was sentenced. She said: “People called me up and ­terrorised me after Susan was jailed. I’ve had eggs thrown at my windows. “People have called me up to say terrible things because they must think I did something with her husband. I don’t deserve any of it. “What happened with Susan has left me unable to trust anyone. I can’t maintain a friendship now. I don’t go out, I hate ­having to meet new people.” Kirsty and Robson had ­immediately hit it off after meeting through a friend in common four years ago. Kirsty said: “Susan seemed really fun. We used to have a laugh. We liked shopping ­together. We went to the Christmas market in Newcastle one year and had a lovely time.    “She had a car and would give me a lt to places. We confided in each other, trusted each other and had a good friendship. I feel betrayed. She has ­completely changed my le. I’m ­suffering the worst pain imaginable. She can rot in jail for what she has done. She needs to learn a ­lesson, no matter how long that takes. I want her to stay in there forever. “She has never tried to apologise or reach out. All she did was try to get the charges against her reduced.” Kirsty’s ordeal began after she was invited to Robson’s house in Kenton, Newcastle, along with some close friends. They all sat in the garden drinking. When Kirsty said she was leaving, Robson’s husband offered to walk her home. Kirsty claims: “Susan was fine with it. Her husband told her and she didn’t bat an eye.” But she later became suspicious and started looking for them. Newcastle crown court heard how she found them in a lane near her home.    Kirsty said: “She shouted to both of us, ‘So that’s where you both are.’ “I remember thinking it was strange because it was such a charged reaction. “She completely got the wrong end of the stick, then she went for me. “I remember her kicking me over and over in my stomach and winding me. When I thought she stopped she dragged me into a nearby alley by my hair. “I couldn’t see her husband anywhere, and wonderedhe had gone to get help. “She started kicking me again and somehow I managed to get on all fours. I held a hand out to get her to stop, while I caught my breath. “When I lted my head to look her in the eye, the last thing I saw was her foot swinging towards my head at full force. I actually heard my neck crack before I passed out.” Kirsty was rushed to hospital. A year on, Kirsty still receives intense physio. She said: “The­ ­attack robbed me of my independence which I’m only just starting to get back now.    I couldn’t do anything for myself and had to rely on carers to help me wash and use the bathroom. It’s ­humiliating and degrading.” After nine days in hospital, Kirsty had to wear a big, heavy head brace for three months. She said: “The doctors said I had to stay awake to have the brace fitted in case something went wrong with them drilling into my skull. “That was almost as bad at the attack itself. I threw up all over my head and neck and I passed out several times.” Robson was also given a five-year order preventing her from contacting Kirsty. The jury heard Robson had eight ­previous convictions, including GBH for attacking a woman she accused of jumping a taxi queue in . Prosecutor Emma Dowling said: “The ­defendant’s husband offered to walk her part of the way home, saying he wanted to visit his ­mother on the way back, which he did. “The defendant formed the view the ­defendant’s husband was about to kiss her. What is clear from CCTV is she was repeatedly assaulted by the defendant in two separate incidents five minutes apart in the same location.” Kirsty said: “She’s a ­dangerous woman and I never want to see her again.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate garraway must never forget","story":"NewsopinionKate Garraway: We must never forget the sacrices our D-Day heroes madeNormandy veterans remind us of our brave soldiers throughout the ages - who continue to fight for what is right and put others before themselvesShareCommentsByKate Garraway:,  JUN NewsopinionKate Garraway and Norman\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAs I stood in glorious weather on the clftops of Ver-sur-Mer beach in France this week, I struggled to ­comprehend the carnage our soldiers endured in the same spot  years ­earlier during the D-Day landings. They were just boys really – some as young as . Waiting to go into battle, watching the sun rise on a day they knew they might never live to see the end of. I have spoken to so many veterans this week and have been moved by every story. There is no doubt they are all heroes, but none thinks of themselves as one.    We talked together in Normandy, where they had ed, not to celebrate their own endeavours but to pay tribute to others, to the comrades whose lives were lost – and to see their sacrice at last rightfully recognised. There hasn’t been a permanent memorial there for the British killed in these battles – until now. So as I watched the veterans salute the official inauguration of one to be built on the very spot where so many of their friends lost their lives, I’m not ashamed to say I shed a tear. And I wasn’t alone. Young serving officers, the same age as the veterans were on D-Day, struggled to properly express to me how much admiration they clearly had for them, but it showed in the tender way they offered their arms to the veterans, now frail with age.These young men and women told me how the veterans had reminded them of why they had joined the army in the first place – to fight for what’s right and to put others before themselves.      Wars today are more complicated. Back then, the enemy was clearly evil, “our side” was clearly good. In recent years, we have entered wars we have regretted, with aims that are unclear, but it reminded me that what we ask of our ­servicemen and women today is no less great, their sacrice no less valuable. The dignitaries present were clearly moved too. I noticed as I stood a few feet from Theresa May how she looked deep into each veteran’s eyes, simply and genuinely saying: “Thank you.” She looked relaxed in their company, happy even, on her last public day as leader of the Conservative Party. Maybe it was the veterans’ sense of duty that appealed to her – after all she has buckets of that herself. Or maybe it was thatever an event put the Westminster ­bickerings and backstabbings over Brexit into perspective, it was this, a time when a sense of common good over personal ambition took over.    The course of my own family’s history was changed by war. My great-grandfather was shot dead in the trenches during the First World War. They say you can’t die of a broken heart but I believe my great-grandmother did just that. She passed away less than a year later. My grandfather and his ­siblings suddenly became orphans and were split up into dferent foster homes. But each carried a segment from a photograph that was found on the body of William when he died. It was of his beloved family, burnt around the edges, no doubt from ­gunfire. It was all that was left. I found it so touching that my grand-father cherished that little part of a photo so much and took such comfort from it. We have heard a lot of stories of courage this week, and read about the bravery and sacrice of the D-Day generation. You may be feeling all “gratituded” out, butyou ever get the chance to stand on those beaches and think, really think, about what so many went through, I know you will be reminded that we can never say thank you enough.

She was also wearing Bahrain Pear Drop earrings, said to have been borrowed from the Queen. Louis appeared a natural on the balcony in front of the crowds and when the national anthem was played the toddler prince joined the spectators in clapping.

Seems fair enough - except another royal source then disagreed, adding: Thereaposs no one laying this out, telling her where to stand. So maybe Meghan simply wanted to take a step back  One mere month after giving birth, no one could blame her for this. Most new mums would probably rather give birth again than participate in an event like Trooping the Colour.    There are also some logistical factors at play with the Royal Family expanding, itaposs getting very crowded on the balcony, and it makes sense to place the little ones at the front, then have their parents behind them so they can keep an eye on them. Also, given itaposs the Queenaposs birthday parade, the focus technically should be on the birthday day - perhaps Meghan was being mindful of that  After all, no one puts Her Maj in the corner.

The end of terrace house, with traditional stone front, is up for sale in the pretty Welsh village of Treherbert in the Rhondda. But any potential buyer may be a little surprised to find out what lies behind the front door.Once inside, youaposre hit by a floor to ceiling Venetian inspired interiors  lavish and grandiose decor, that wouldnapost look out of place inside a stately home, reports Wales Online .The house is owned by Denise and Michael Protheroe, whoaposve spent the last decade gradually transforming it into their dream home - which they now share with their three Shitzus, Coco, Sparkle and Gucci, and their bird Twinkle.  Michael admits he now feels telling his we she could do she wanted with the house was a big mistake. Denise - whoaposs originally from Liverpool, met Michael, from Rhondda, while on holiday in Corfu around  years ago. When I first came up here, everyone thought I was nuts, -year-old Denise laughed. There was this one time, when a delivery man came to drop something off... Next minute, he comes running in with his camera and starts taking pictures. He saw the photo frame around my TV and said aposIaposve never seen anything like this beforeapos.  But, as long as youaposre happy. Itaposs your own house, and youaposve just got to do what you want with it - itaposs not everybodyaposs taste. And the couple couldnapost be happier. They make the perfect team - with Denise coming up with quirky and unique designs, and Michael - a former award-winning painter and decorator - making her visions become a reality. When I first met her and I asked her to move down - I told her you can do what you like to the house. That was a big mistake, Michael joked. I eat my words now. I never knew what I was coming home from work to. Denise - who says sheaposs always had an interest in fashion and interior design - says the interior of her house matches her outgoing, bubbly and colourful personality.    The theme is all glitz and glamour, with the chandeliers and diamantes, she said. I love glamour and sparkle - like Hollywood style mansions. All the little pieces Iaposve collected - they all mean a lot to me and they make me feel special. I used to go to a lot of manor houses, so thataposs what my intentions were with this house - to make it feel as posh as I could. I canapost afford a big manor house or a stately home or anything like that - so, this is my own little stately home. As you walk into Denise and Michaelaposs home, the entrance hallway is dripping with glass, crystals and diamonds.  The walls, mirrored cabinets and ceilings are packed with sparkling ornaments, fancy candle stands and ornate silver frames - all placed below a hanging crystal chandelier. The glamour continues in the dining room, and the open-plan space is packed with royal blue and silver crushed velvet furniture, ornaments, decorative bird cages, grandfather clocks and glass cabinets. The room revolves around a deluxe white dining table, and also includes a diamond-encrusted chaise lounge, th century settee, throne-like chairs, mirrors, vases and another crystal chandelier. The space under the stairs is also home to a huge doll-house - which Denise spent years designing, painting and decorating - even going as far as adorning the bathroom with porcelain fittings and asking her local funeral home to make a doll-sized gravestone for the church cemetary.  I just love using my imagination, Denise says. As you head further into the house, an intricate archway guards the entrance to the living room, which in-keeping with the opulent and regal theme is dressed with silver, glass and diamond fittings and framed by thick, heavy blue crushed velvet curtains which Denise made herself. Denise has designed almost every feature in the house - from the banisters to the mirrored staircase and sheaposs even made all of her own curtains and upholstered the furniture. Sheaposs up-cycled and painted almost everything - from the walls, to the fireplaces, lampshades, ling and even the white photo frame that hangs around the TV. Stand still long enough and Iaposll paint you, laughed Denise. From the diamonds around the fire place to the jewelled white throne that sits in the corner of the living room, painted Venetian sculptures, fairy-lights, mirrors and crushed velvet French-style furniture - Denise has meticulously planned, designed and created everything.  Even down to the sparkling glitter paint which covers the walls - created by buying big bags of glitter from BQ and mixing it with paint. And she gets her inspiration from property, DIY and antique television programmes, as well as the internet. I like old furniture, and I love visiting mansions and manor houses. So,when Iaposm there and I see a piece of furniture, I can visualise in my head where I want to put it in my house. And thataposs what Iaposve done. Towards the rear of the property is the kitchen, which unlike the grey and blue theme of the other rooms, is completely red. It has red chandeliers, utensils, flowers, chairs, units, crockery, towels, candles - and even a red ornament of the animated cartoon character Betty Boop.  Access to the first floor is gained via a striking feature staircase. The master bedroom then comes complete with a gold, regal-style canopy above the bed which was designed and created by Denise and Michael from pieces of plywood. Finished off with some gold curtains and hanging diamonds, it frames the white, vintage-style bed which is completely covered in cushions and decorative items. But, perhaps the most unique feature of the entire property is the Da Vinci-style mural which has been painted onto the ceiling of the master bedroom. Iaposve always loved murals on ceilings - like the ones in churches, cathedrals and mansions, Denise said. I thought one of these days Iaposm going to do something like that. Iaposm going to do that in my bedroom and, I did! Denise commissioned a local painter to do the mural who completed it in under two days. The bathroom also doesnapost disappoint when it comes to grandiose features. The stand-alone bathtub is raised on a specially built plinth, and the hand basin is built into an impressive base of storage cupboards - which Michael fitted himself.  Itaposs finished off with fairy-lights, crystal chandeliers and candle-stick holders, vintage ornaments, a knight in shining armour and even a crown above the toilet seat. If that wasnapost enough, the property also features a fully-renovated and insulated summer house which, following a tropical theme, is filled with pink and green curtains, flamingo decorations, plants and lights. It also comes with a hot pink, jewelled fireplace, a blue shaggy rug, crushed velvet chairs and even has electricity with a kettle to make tea and coffee and a television to watch DVDs. The summer house is just like another room - itaposs a nice place to just go for a cup of tea and a chat, Denise said. Unfortunately, Denise and Michael are now selling their beloved home as the couple plan to move to Liverpool to spend time with Deniseaposs family and elderly mother. My dad was ill with dementia and he died in January, Denise said. Living down here, I missed out on a lot of his le and being there with him. And now, my mum isnapost well. Iaposve also got two grandchildren up in Liverpool, so we want to go and spend time with them.  Michael added: When Denise moved down here, I told her that weaposd move back to Liverpool when I retired and when the time was right. And Iaposm not getting any younger! But, Denise says sheaposs already got hundreds of ideas for the designs of their new house in Liverpool. I go to bed and my mind goes a hundred miles an hour - I just canapost stop it, she laughed. The property is on the market for £, with South Wales Property Investors and Lettings. Estate agent Miranda Pugh said: We love having properties with the wow factor on our books and this property definitely has that. Not all buyers want your average style properties and some clients are unique and want something dferent. Some agents would be put off by this property, but not us. We love the wow factor and I can guarantee we will sell this house and help find these beautul sellers their next dream home.

Sorry, but that means Esther knows nothing. The Tory leadership ­hopeful and former CBBC presenter has waded in on the ongoing drama at a ­Birmingham school gate. A group of mainly Muslim parents have been protesting at Anderton Park Primary because they do not want their kids taught about the LGBT community. As a parent of primary school kids and as a Muslim, I find their actions ­offensive and totally out of touch with modern British values. They are also at odds with the law, as the Equalities Act protects people from discrimination over their sexual orientation. So for McVey to take their side shows shockingly poor judgment. “Parents need to have the final say on what they want their ­children to know,” she blasted.    No, no, no! That’s not how our education system works, Esther. Schools have to stick to equality laws. Lessons need to reflect modern society, so children know about dferent types of families, and teachers can answer ­questions on what “lesbian” and “gay” means. They need to be able to discuss unhealthy relationships, including violence and bullying. I have no qualms about teachers ­delivering this sensitive information in a way that lets my kids understand the modern and erse Britain they are growing up in. My Muslim parents, who came to this country from a remote village in the Himalayas, arrived with their own limited points of view, with fear and ignorance. They brought me and my siblings up with blinkers on. They never talked to me about sex, my body, relationships, other cultures – I learned all those things at school. Thank heavens I did. School taught me about my body changing, so puberty didn’t come as a shock, and it opened my eyes to other religions. All my parents ever mentioned was Islam – it was all they knew. Through my education, I was also educating them and helping them integrate into British society and opening up their world, which helped them become more tolerant.  Yet Ms McVey thinks those narrow-minded Muslim parents in Birmingham know what is best for their kids. Following religion in a manner that results in children growing up homophobic, sexist, ­misogynistic and racist is cruel.Should these mums and dads also pull their children from ­religious education on Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity  Boycott science lessons on evolution Today, my mum has no issues when I ­introduce her to my LGBT friends. She doesn’t feel less of a Muslim by acknowledging their dferences. In fact she is a better Muslim for it. Unlike Ms McVey, I have full faith in the British education system. And I hope those children in Birmingham grow up to teach their parents a thing or two.

If you have a vegan colleague, however, you may have to rethink whether or not they get included in these. According to senior lawyer Alex Monaco, vegans should be exempt from making tea because putting them in a position where they have to handle cowsapos milk could be classied as discrimination. The claims come as campaigners apply pressure on equality law-makers to outlaw vegan discrimination at work, saying veganism is akin to religious belief and therefore merits the same protection under the Equality Act .    Alex Monaco, from law firm Monaco Solicitors, told MailOnline: If you were Jewish or Muslim and told to get a round of bacon sandwiches in, no one would bat an eyelidyou refused. Butyouaposre vegan and refused to buy a pint of milk to make tea because you believe the dairy industry is torturing cows, then you would be laughed out of the kitchen.

Rector The Rev Peter Hughes published a three page rant in the parish magazine claiming teaching kids about gay and trans relationships opens the door for sexual predators. He added that giving lessons about LGBTI - an abbreviation for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex - was state-sponsored child abuse. Mr Hughes, a governor of a Church of England Primary School, stunned his congregation at St Albanaposs, Wickersley, near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, when he published his letter in the magazine. He penned his remarks in response to the Muslim protests in Birmingham about the lessons. He wrote: Christian parents need to wake up to the danger posed by cultural Marxists targeting their children with LGBT ideology.  Christians should love those who self identy as LGBTI along with our neighbours, but this cannot mean we are obliged to celebrate LGBTI ideology and lestyles and promote them to our children. The UK Governmentaposs proposed Relationships and Sexual Education Programme is nothing but state sponsored child abuse. It teaches that gender is a mere social construct those who want to change gender can do so by simply self identying as whatever gender they chose. He claimed a seven-year-old girl had been reduced to tears when she asked her parents: Mummy, am I a boy or a girl  My teacher says I can choose. THE RSE programme is a form of child grooming. The Government may not intend this to happen but it is the effective result. This sexual indoctrination of young children prepares them for early sexual experimentation, normalises it and, in so doing, opens the door for sexual predators. The rector claims the Government makes no secret that it aims to use education to promote LGBTI lestyles and identities.  He continued: For the sake of not only our own children but for the love of others, Christians must resist the tide of cultural Marxism. Mr Hughes is also a school governor at St Albanaposs C of E Primary School, which has launched an investigation. The article, called Parents Take Back Control!, praised the controversial protests by Muslim parents against primary school sex education classes in Birmingham. The school and its trust jointly said in a joint statement yesterday, Mr Hughes was entitled to his views, which they did not share. There is a due processwe feel any governor has brought the school or academy into disrepute, a statement said. That process has begun, which does of course include a full investigation before a decision is made. The Reverend Huw Thomas, the Diocese of Sheffieldaposs director of education, said the views were personal ones. These views are not shared by the Diocese of Sheffield and the language used is regrettable, he said.    Mr Thomas added parents had the right to exercise discretion in withdrawing their children from sex education. Paul Scriven, a Liberal Democrat peer and former leader of Sheffield Council, stormed: Heaposs a fool, I think he knows nothing about whataposs going on. He doesnapost have the right to use these opinions to stop young people being taught to understand the world they inherit. He is quite right to have his personal opinions I think theyaposre wrong and outdated. Primary and secondary pupils in England are to learn about relationships as part of compulsory lessons from September .

The charge states she allegedly stole jewellery, art and cash to the value of £,. Geuorgoieva appeared in the dock wearing a denim jacket over a black and white top, and black trousers. She spoke to confirm her name, address, date of birth, and that she has dual Bulgarian and British nationality, at a brief hearing during which prosecutor Manjit Mahal outlined the case against her. Geuorgoieva was not asked to enter a plea. District Judge Margot Coleman remanded her in custody and told her she will next appear at Southwark Crown Court on July .

The thousands of holidaymakers who will bring this Lincolnshire resort to le are still a few weeks away. But there are people here and hard at work. And they include me. I am at Billy Butlin’s original holiday camp to try out for a series of jobs in the wake of criticism that the holiday icon favours foreign staff, rather than Brits. First stop is the kitchen, where over the course of a year , bananas are peeled,  tons of baked beans are served and almost a million eggs, , sausages and .million rashers of bacon are cooked. Mark Murphy, head chef of the Coral Reef restaurant, expresses some alarm about my kne technique as I struggle to transform fruit into fun creatures for kids.    To be fair, I’ve never been good in the kitchen. My hubby never tires of telling how I once tried to grill a frozen pizza. Team head chef Ty Chojnacki and a -strong team feed , people per holiday break, on week-long or short breaks. Ty arrived  years ago after spotting an advert on the side of a bus in Krakow, Poland. He said: “I’ve made Skegness my home and I love it here. A lot of local people assume that Butlins is only seasonal but you can really make a career here. All they need is passion and we can give them the skills.” In the Sky Bar, larger-than-le character Glyn Price, , booms with infectious laughter while teaching me how to mix a virgin cocktail.  Chatty Turns out my cocktail-making skills are a lot better than my cooking. Hmmm, I wonder why  Glyn says the trick to handling hundreds of customers a night is to “remain calm and chatty”. He adds: “You’ve got to be able to multi-task because there’s so much going on – children running about enjoying themselves, customers queueing and people ordering cocktails.”  Sounds exhausting. I head to a chalet where I’m to be taught how to create towel animals and make a bed properly. Oh come on! How dficult can it be  Not so easy, at it turns out. Especially in a minute. There’s all the proper tucking in, changing duvets – and my towel swan looked more ugly duckling.

Why   The official line is that people don’t realise they can have a year-round job. But I secretly suspect there’s a degree of snobbery involved. And there’s a suspicion – a perpetual rumour in a town where seven in  back Brexit – that Eastern Europeans are preferred “as they cost less”. “They don’t want local people, we’re not cheap enough,” says a -year-old as he cycles by. Bosses say  per cent of staff are British and there is equality on pay – starting at minimum wage and rising with promotion. And assistant housekeeper Zoltan Uji, , from Hungary, adds: “The jobs are therepeople want to apply for them.” For me, my stint with Butlins is over and I leave with new-found admiration for a dedicated workforce.

Scientists believe the prehistoric remains, found with the brain intact, date more than , years ago, reports The Siberian Times. The predator is thought to have a thick mammoth-like coat and fangs larger than wolves in Siberia today. The discovery was made above the Arctic Circle by local man Pavel Efimov in summer  near the Tirekhtyakh River.    The reason the the wolfaposs head is severed is not known. But scientists say it is unlikely to have been the trophy of a hunter since early man only started to arrive in this part of northern Russia around , years ago. Russian scientist Dr Albert Protopopov said: “This is a unique discovery of the first-ever remains of a fully grown Pleistocene wolf with its tissue preserved. “We will be comparing it to modern-day wolves to understand how the species has evolved and to reconstruct its appearance.” Scientists at the Swedish Museum of Natural History will examine the predator’s DNA. The discovery has only recently been announced in Tokyo at an exhibition of remains of frozen beasts.    The exhibition also features the remains of mammoths and a cave lion cub named Spartak, which was found around the same time as the wolfaposs head. Naoki Suzuki, a professor at Jikei University School of Medicine in Tokyo who made CT scans of the ancient remains said: “Their muscles, organs and brains are in good condition. “We want to assess their physical capabilities and ecology by comparing them with the lions and wolves of today.” "},{"url":null,"title":"cammy kerr pens two year deal to keep him at dens park until 2021","story":"Cammy Kerr has signed a new deal with Dundee FC, keeping him with the Dens Park club until at least .The right-back, who joined the club in  and has had loan spells with Peterhead, put pen to paper today after an offer from new boss James McPake.The -year-old was on the verge of leaving under previous manager Jim McIntyre, but will now stay on at his boyhood club."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.43394356-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.43394356-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.43394356-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/06/2.43394356-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"declan mcdaid buzzing to become dundee manager james mcpakes first signing","story":"Declan McDaid is “buzzing” to become Dundee manager James McPake’s first signing as manager.The -year-old signed up at Dens Park on a two-year deal on Thursday after leaving Ayr United at the end of last season.And he plans to entertain fans of the Dark Blues.He said: “I’m a winger, I like to get at people, get balls in the box and get shots off.“Get goals and assists and help the team as much as I can.”The former Partick Thistle man revealed he turned down an Irish club to sign on the dotted line at Dundee.He said: “I got back from holiday and heard that Dundee were interested from my agent.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

All it took was a request and the work was done in time for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day on June .Geordie Rhodick, chairman, LAFDSirFor the past two years, since he was elected to Argyll and Bute Council by the skin of his teeth, Councillor Alastair Redman has bombarded local newspapers with a constant stream of drivel attacking the Scottish Government.In his latest diatribe, he alleges that #the SNP has completely misjudged the mood of voters up and down the country#.I know it will be extremely painful for him, buthe can bring himself to review last week’s European Election results in Scotland, he’ll see the complete fallacy of this statement, andhe wants to look even closer to home, he’ll see that the SNP polled , votes in Argyll and Bute – , votes ahead of the Tories who came a distant fourth.Hardly a sign of his mythical assertion that Ruth Davidson is poised to be the next First Minister of Scotland.Robert Macintyre, Serpentine Road, RothesayDear PaulI write on behalf of constituents in Tarbert regarding the application for the Inveraray to Crossaig kV overhead line, which is with the [Scottish Government] Energy Consents Unit.A very large number of constituents have contacted me regarding this matter and almost  have signed a petition.They believe the proposal will have a major deleterious effect on the village and will be a huge and ugly blot on the landscape which, given the very attractive and scenic nature of the area, will be a big disincentive to tourism and will spoil the enjoyment of the area for residents as well.I have met with SSE to discuss this issue and have made it clear to them that the community wishes the company to come forward with alternative proposals, which must include undergrounding the cableno route can be found which does not spoil the visual amenity of the village.I know that the new line is needed for entirely understandable and positive reasons, and I have had only a few complaints from other parts of the area which will be affected.The opposition in Tarbert is virtually unanimous and there is also concern being expressed from those who know and value the area but do not live there.I hope that any consideration of consent will ensure that this issue is dealt with in accordance with the views of local people and I would be grateful to hear from you what the timescale is for that decision .Michael RussellSir,Newly-elected UK MEPs will take their seats in the European Parliament in July and it is crucial they recognise their signicant role in shaping the policies that impact on farming businesses. This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle. The race committee nonetheless got two races in for a number of the fleets.Protests concluded, Saturday’s prize giving announced the remaining results from Friday. This showed #s winner and RC Makars Mash class yacht Storm looking strong with a first place.Chimaera showed early signs of being a threat to the Scottish Series crown, taking a first in Friday racing. With no immediate showing of a dominant yacht in the IRC Class  fleet from Friday’s races, it was IRC class four that showed a brewing battle between Lady Ex and F’n Gr. In the CYCA Class  fleet, First by Farr surfaced with the highest number of race wins from Friday.Not to be outdone, CYCA Class  saw the final results dominated by Cool Bandit  before Saturday#s results were announced. With the weather mixing up the league table for Saturday, there were a lot of yachts taking home prizes.Saturday evening saw theof Big Vern and The Shootahs to the Scottish Series for another year and a spectacular fireworks display in celebration of Valhalla of Ashton’s th year on the water.Sunday saw yet another big weather sht with forecasts up to  knots. Loch Fyne likes to mix it up a bit so the fleets ventured out into more sedate conditions than those forecast. But as the weather built, race officers shortened the traditional round Inchmarnock passage race.Sunday prizes featured an additional prize for the best performer in each fleet. Glenn Porter started proceedings with a special award for #assisting mark layers# to the competitor who got tangled up in one of the race marks. In IRC Class  it was El Gran Senor and Forty Licks shining through. The Makars Mash RC class saw Hijacker leading the prize haul. In IRC Class it was Mata taking the #extra# prize. IRC class four saw F’n Gr take a clean sweep of firsts in both races. With only one race in CYCA  and , it was Reflection and Salamander XXII taking home the wins. In the Etchells One,  Design Hero took a win in both races with Squawk leading the way in the Sigma  One Design Class. In the Hunter  fleet Miss Moneypenny was the only yacht placed in both races taking home the best performer of the day for the s. With two firsts in the Sonata one design, Fiddlesticks made the most of the Sunday conditions. Finally, the CYCA restricted sail fleet saw Celtic Spirit take first place.The  event saw the marquee remain open for the Sunday evening as part of additional shoreside activities supported by Event Scotland.An earlier start on Monday was greeted with sunshine and no wind. This time the challenge was just too much for race officers who had to abandon racing for the day. Despite a number of the competitors making the most of the early finish and heading home, the final prize giving was one of the best attended in recent years.Clyde Cruising Club Commodore John Readman paid special thanks to the valued participants, sponsors, supporters, volunteers and locals, without whom there would be no event.Scottish Series Trophy and overall Series Winner: #Chimaera#Joe Deane Cup and Knox Anchor: Salamander XXIRosebowl: ChimaeraTunnocks# Cup: ReflectionCrinan Cup: Celtic SpiritCrawford McInnes Trophy : ReflectionLemarac Tankard: Celtic SpiritCauseway Cup: F#n GrAlfred Mylne Trophy: HeroClyde Bowl: Celtic SpiritValhalla of Ashton Salver volunteer Award: The Tech or Raynet TeamLa Rochelle Trophy: LyrebirdThe McIver Salver : F#n GrIRC: Forty LicksRC: ChimaeraIRC: HarmonyIRC: F#n GrCYCA: First by FarrCYCA: Salamander XXIICYCA: Celtic SpiritSigma  OOD: Leaky Roof Sonata OD: FiddlesticksHunter  OD: SeawordEtchells OD: HeroIRC: Something ElseCYCA: First EditionOne Design: Miss Moneypenny,  Class Association"},{"url":null,"title":"kyles defeat inveraray in camanachd cup","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsKyles Athletic are through to the quarter finals after beating Inveraray - at Kames Playing Fields.The opening goal came on  minutes following a scramble around the penalty spot.

Galashiels ndash who was a Captain and i c of A Company, st Battalion Kingrsquos Own Scottish Borderers, in the second assault wave on the morning of June .By June , , the Battalion had moved into the marshalling area Camp A. By this time all ranks of the Battalion had been briefed on maps with bogus name and map references - but everyone was fully in the lsquopicturersquo as to the plan for the invasion of the continent . The time in A was spent testing weapons and lsquoteeingrsquo up all the last details for the lsquobig dayrsquo.In the early morning of June , the Battalion embussed in TCVs and moved to the final Assembly area at Victoria Barracks, Plymouth. At am we were informed that owing to bad weather the operation had been postponed  hours.On June  we again moved to Victoria Barracks and at  hours started embarking on LSIs , although there was a fairly heavy sea running. The Battalion was on board by .. We sat at anchor until . when we set sail for the big adventure for which most of us had been waiting four years. It was an amazing sight, all around as far as the eye could see, there were ships of all shapes and sizes bobbing up and down on the water with their ensigns flying bravely in the summer breeze. As we passed the flag ship, with our Divisional Commander, Major-General Rennie and Admiral Vian on board, all ranks turned out on deck and saluted while the pipers played our Regimental march ldquoBlue Bonnets orsquoer the Border.The sea journey was one of the worst we had experienced, there was a heavy swell running and most of the Battalion felt very ill. After midnight maps were issued and from these, we saw we were scheduled to lsquotouch downrsquo at Lion-Sur-Mer about three miles west of Ouistreham.About . on June  we could see faintly the coast of Normandy on the horizon, all around us were battleships, cruisers and destroyers firing at the enemy, while overhead there was a continual stream of bombers and fighters. As we drew nearer the shore, we could see LCAs, DUKWs, etc ferrying stores from larger ships to shore.At . we were ordered to lsquostand byrsquo to disembark. Each man carried his normal equipment and personal weapon plus to extra bandoliers of ammunition, two -hour ration packs and an airborne bicycle. We had expected a wet landing but when we touched down, dead on time at ., we stepped off the LCI on to the shore. The Navy had certainly put up a terric show and now it was up to us.It took only a few minutes for the Battalion to disembark and then we moved off to our Assembly area north of Hermanville-Sur-Mer , this move was carried out without incident except for a few heavy shells from the coastal guns at Le Havre.At . the Battalion were ordered to move to St Aubin drsquoArquenay and ordered to lsquodig inrsquo. At . we witnessed what must be one of the most spectacular sights of the war - the landing of the Reserve Brigade of the th Airborne Division. It was certainly heartening for us, as up to then we had the feeling that we were all alone on the continent. Several prisoners were brought in during the night.Early on June  we prepared to attack the village of Gazelle. We moved on bicycles through Periers-Sur-le-Dan preparatory to the attack. At midday patrols reported Gazelle clear of the enemy and led by lsquoCrsquo Companythe Battalion moved through Gazelle to the woods north of Le Mesnil.We stayed until the morning of the th when we were relieved by the S Lancs while the Royal Ulster Rlesattacked Cambes Wood.

The Battalion attacked after passing through the RUR and were met by machine gun fire and heavy mortar fire, but all Coys successfully reached their objectives. The Battalion suffered several casualties mainly from mortar fire.From June  to  the Battalion remained in Cambes Wood, where we were continually shelled and mortared and suffered fairly heavy casualties.Enemy mortar and artillery was very active ndash Battalion HQ receiving most attention. lsquoArsquo Coy HQ unfortunately came in for a very heavy lsquostonkrsquo and lost five killed and seven wounded. The end of the month saw the Battalion back in Cambes Wood once more, when we took over the right half of the line from the nd Lincs.During the month of June the Battalion sustained the following casualties two officers and  other ranks killed, eight officers and  other ranks wounded, and four other ranks missing.The Battalion remained in Cambes Wood till July . We continued to probe the enemy defences at night by patrolling. Sgt Grant carried out a very successful  hour patrol in the area of Galmanche.

On the evening of July  the Battalion took over the nd Kings Shropshire Light Infantry in the area of Le Homme. A large formation of Allied bombers raided Caen in the early evening.On July  the Battalion again moved forward, this time to the area of Lebissey. There was some enemy mortar and artillery fire, but few casualties were suffered.On July  in conjunction with the RUR and Canadians, the Battalion attacked Caen. The Battalion was ordered to attack from the West with the RUR on our right. The Battalion moved to the Forming Up Pointon the outskirts of Caen. We were continually shelled from the Eastern side of the River Orne. It was a very unpleasant approach march to the FUP as the ground was completely open and overlooked from the high ground on the far side of the river. Led by lsquoCrsquo and lsquoDrsquo Coys the Battalion advanced into Caen and proceeded to winkle out the enemy. This proved a very slow job, the town had been heavily bombed and the roads crated or blocked by rubble, giving ideal cover from snipers and Spandau posts. By early evening all companies had reached their objectives, patrols established on the canal, and contact established with the RUR. The civilians gave everyone a terric welcome and produced wine, fruit and bouquets of flowers.On July  the Battalion continued to lsquomop uprsquo the town. There was slight enemy shelling during the day.On the morning of July , the Battalion were relieved by Canadians and moved to a rest area at Plumeto where the time was spent cleaning up, kit inspections and parades. Football games were organised and there was a generous allotment for film shows, swimming, etc. The Pipe Band played Retreat for the first time since landing, on the evening of the th. Officers and Other Rank reinforcements joined the Battalion and on the th we moved off at full strength to the area of Ranville, east of the Orne river, in preparation for operation lsquoGoodwoodrsquo, our objective in this operation was the important road centre of Troarn.On the morning of July , the Battalion moved off via Herouvillette, Touffreville to Sannerville. This was the worst approach march the Battalion had ever experienced. It was a hot summerrsquos day and having to follow the same route as an armoured Div and we were completely overlooked by the enemy. Enemy shells and mortaring was heavy and we experienced for the first time the enemyrsquos multi-barrelled mortarndash several casualties were suffered by the Battalion, including the CO, Lt. Col G.D. Renny. He was wounded in the face and arm but refused to be evacuated.On passing through the RUR at Sannerville lsquoDrsquo and lsquoBrsquo Coys pushed forward and encountered enemy machine guns. The enemy shelling continued throughout the whole advance. After lsquoBrsquo Coy had successfully put in an attack, the Battalion occupied an orchard about  yards west of Troarn where consolidation was carried out. During the night enemy shelling continued and enemy patrols encountered. On the th, the Battalion attack towards Troarn was continued, lsquoCrsquo Coy left ndash lsquoArsquo Coy right. Both Coys advanced, but were met with heavy machine gun fire, and although supported by tanks, were forced to withdraw with heavy casualties.The Battalion took up its former positions and spent a most unpleasant day of enemy mortar and shell fire.The C.O. was ordered to be evacuated by the Brigadier and Major T.G. Coverdale took over command of the Battalion. Casualties in the Battalion in this action were  officers and  other Ranks. To make things more unpleasant we had  hours solid rain. Enemy shelling and mortaring continued but our own guns had moved up and they did some very good counter battery shoots.On July , two enemy Stretcher Bearersapproached lsquoBrsquo Coy position and asked that they and ourselves should bury our dead who were lying in lsquoNo manrsquos landrsquo. A party of SBs under our Padre, Capt Wilson, went out and did this job. As in Cambes Wood some very good patrolling was done, and several prisoners were taken mostly from  Fusilier Battalion and  Panzer Grenadiers.On July , Lt. Col. J.F.M. MacDonald took over command of the Battalion. A strong enemy patrol attempted to penetrate lsquoBrsquo Coy position but were beaten off by small arms and two-inch mortar fire.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"youth-football-club-kicked-out-of-holiday-park-after-incidents","story":"Several teams from Preston Athletic Youth Football Club, Prestonpans ndash featuring players aged between seven and  years old ndash ventured south last Friday to take part in the weekend-long Flamingo Land Soccer Festival.But they were asked to leave the famous Flamingo Land theme park, where they were staying, on Sunday ndash and were forced toto Scotland a day earlier than planned ndash due to alleged ldquoanti-social behaviour from adults and children in the group.During one incident, police arrested an -year-old woman from the group during an altercation with a -year-old man and members of the security team at the park on Saturday evening.North Yorkshire Police confirmed the woman was arrested on suspicion of assault, though no charges were made against her.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"what-it-feels-like-to-have-a-breast-reduction","story":"In  I put myself under a scalpel in Ross Hall hospital in Glasgow and had my breasts reduced in size. Even today, I still contemplate the magnitude of my decision and the impact that it has had on not just my body but my le, my femininity, my mental health.Returning to university le as normal, I sat alone in my room, felt the scars that indicated lacerated skin and I cried. It was so massively emotional, but I had no idea what the emotions meant. Was I sad  No. Was I happy  No. I simply felt like I had been through a sort of battle. I have never felt more like a woman than I did holding those numbed, stitched-up breasts. I was gloriously, disfiguredly, me.ldquoWhy did you do it  is the question that those who are brave enough ask. ldquoI used to have massive boobs and I hated them, is usually my reply.But why did I do it  What made me resent my own body enough to perform a permanent assault On holiday, a boy I had never met grabbed my chest in the pool. I stared at him, he stared at me, I left the pool, he stayed in. On the hockey pitch, a female teacher advised me, ldquomaybe you should invest in a more appropriate ndash less distracting ndash bra .As I ran around the pitch, the boys would sit on the hill and there would be silence and craned necks as I passed. Once, my lsquofriendrsquo parked his car at the side of a road, saying ldquoyou donrsquot know how long Irsquove waited for this. Me  Yoursquove waited for me  Or for this handful of skin and tissue What about the man who only broke his stare after a few growled words from my father  What about the older boy who stood in the doorframe of my maths class and whispers a name that I had been branded with quietly, viciously, when it was all ldquojust a laugh The torrent was unleashed, and it washed over me like a current. In , the time had come to stop laughing it off.I did not just achieve smaller breasts. I achieved long scars across my body. They signy the deep and complex answer of what it means to be a woman in the st century. My long white, silver and lilac carnations that thread across my body remind me what this body is. This body will get paid p to a manrsquos pound. It will be scrutinised as it ages, it is taxed for the blood that spills out of it it must crash through glass ceilings to work beside its male counterparts.These long lines that I cherish remind me that this body is mine: not a future husbands, or ex-boyfriendsrsquo or future-boyfriendsrsquo, or employersrsquo. It is not a gt from a God I donrsquot believe in. It is mine: it belongs to a thinking being, a woman who when walking home in the darkness of night feels hunted. I felt harassed by my own body. What a sad story,I hadnrsquot had the agency to do what I did. I love my scars, because they allow me to forget the reasons why it is my body that allows me to say me, too."},{"url":null,"title":"Glasgow  Gateway to Scotland  11 of the best food experiences","story":"Within two hours of the city, meanwhile, you can enjoy an exciting and erse array of bucketlist food experiences showcasing Scottish produce, from seafood on the pier at Oban to hand-picking the sweetest raspberries in Angus.

iniduals at The Beatson have treated, cared for and supported me every step of the way.\"It is understood Ms Grays absence is linked to her husbands health.It is nearly a year since the second disastrous fire at the Mackintosh Building at the Glasgow School of Art on June .Ms Gray, also an author and television presenter, and a graduate of the school, has been much in the news since that fire, which left the historic building gutted.The causes of the fire have yet to be established formally by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.It is understood that investigators still wish to probe areas of the Mackintosh Building, including the basement area.Ms Gray has been a stalwart defender of the GSAs treatment of the building before and after the fire.Last September she said that the Mackintosh Building could be rebuilt, albeit over four to seven years, using Charles Rennie Mackintoshs original plans.Original plans from the Mackintosh Building, built in two stages between  and , are held in the GSAs stores and at the Hunterian at Glasgow University, and the school also has digital plan, called a BIM Model, from the restoration work following the  fire.Ms Gray said: \"This time it will be built with such knowledge and expertise that we have learned since .\"We are resolved that the Mackintosh comes back as a working art school, as a major player, a cultural leader for the city and the Scottish economy.\"The chair appeared at the Culture Committee of the Scottish Parliament hearings last year.Those hearings led to a critical MSP report into the GSAs treatment of the Mackintosh Building, which also suffered a fire in .The MSP report called for a full judicial inquiry in the two fires at the building, and raised the question of the building being run by a Trust, rather than the GSA.The GSA responded to the MSP report, questioning and querying some of its findings, and in turn, last week the Culture Committee responded.The Culture Committee, which is led by convenor Joan McAlpine MSP, says: \"The recommendations made in the Committeersquos report are based on the balance of evidence provided over the course of the inquiry taking cognisance of the views of a iety of parties with a range of experience and expertise.\"The Committee is therefore extremely disappointed that the GSArsquos response seeks to question the credibility of the evidence provided by some of the witnesses.\""},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-labour-to-decide-on-support-for-referendum-on-brexit-deal","story":"The partyrsquos executive committee is due to meet in Glasgow to

has arisen because of declining standards in nursery school, a teacher told the annual general meeting of the Educational Institute of Scotland .In recent years, councils have replaced teachers with lower-paid child development officers ndash previously called nursery nurses ndash partly on cost grounds, but also because they work longer hours.Councils argue child development officers are now better qualied than ever following the introduction of new qualications and their use allows them to open nurseries for longer in order to meet the demands of working parents.However, research has consistently highlighted the importance of teachers in nursery education.Jillian Gillespie, a primary teacher, told the EIS agm in Perth: ldquoOver the years we have seen a steady decline in the abilities of children coming into P.ldquoPoor communication skills, poor speech, social and emotional dficulties, lack of independence. We can no longer assume that the children coming into P have a basic level of ability.ldquoSome children are coming in to school unable to speak in sentences, they donrsquot know how to sit and listen and a majority of them donrsquot even know how to hold a pencil.Ms Gillespie said the job of being a P teacher was getting harder every year because there was ldquono educational input in nurseries.And she warned the situation had arisen at a time when the Scottish Government was doubling the provision of free nursery places.ldquoLocal authorities are decreasing the educational value in the early years and we need to put teachers back into nursery, she added.ldquoOur curriculum is three to  and we should have a teacher there educating from three.ldquoI am not disrespecting what our early years officers do, they do a very good job, but teachers are qualied to a higher standard and can offer high quality educational activities and encourage pupilsrsquo development.A motion from the Dumfries and Galloway EIS local association called on the agm to campaign for qualied teachers to be part of the core staffing of nurseries."},{"url":null,"title":"dominic-raab-refuses-to-rule-out-suspending-parliament-in-brexit-test-of-nerve","story":"The Tory leadership contender said it was ldquovery unlikely it would be necessary to prorogue Parliament in order to prevent MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit, but taking the option off the table would be a mistake.Mr Raab said it was a ldquotest of nerve and his rivals would weaken the UKrsquos position in negotiations with Brussels by ruling out options to guarantee Brexit.Critics of the approach have warned that prorogation would involve the Queen in a constitutional crisis, because formally it is the monarch who ends a session of Parliament.Bur Mr Raab said it was unlikely to come to that because MPsrsquo powers to block a no-deal Brexit were limited.Pointing to Institute for Government analysis, he said it would be much more dficult ldquofor Parliament to engage in the guerrilla warfare sabotage of a government that was resolved to leave by October .But in a message to his rivals ndash and an appeal to hardline Brexiteers on the Tory benches to back his campaign ndash Mr Raab said it was necessary to demonstrate a willingness to take such measures.ldquoIthink itrsquos wrong to rule out any tool to make sure that we leave by the end of October, he told BBC Radio rsquos Today.ldquoThe exam question in this contest is lsquowho can be trusted to lead us out by the end of October and end this paralysing uncertaintyrsquo.Mr Raab said he would go back to Brussels with a ldquobest, final offer including the removal of the Irish backstop, but said there could be no further delay and the UK would be prepared to leave without a deal, falling back on World Trade Organisation rules.ldquoI think anyone who is talking about delay or who is taking WTO off the table is having the perverse effect of weakening our negotiating position in Brussels, thatrsquos the lesson of the last three years, he said.ldquoItrsquos a test of nerve here andcandidates cannot stand up their resolve to lead us out by the end of October in a leadership contest, what chance would they have under the heat of the negotiations in Brussels Mr Raab said the Peterborough by-election, in which the Tories finished third, and the drubbing in the European elections, showed it was ldquodevastating for the Conservativeswe donrsquot keep our promises on Brexit.He added: ldquoWhat we canrsquot have is this paralysing uncertainty, bad for the economy, bad for trust in democracy, bad for the Conservatives ndash as we are seeing ndash of just going on and on with this prolonged torture of haggling with the EU when we havenrsquot got a deal in sight.Following Theresa Mayrsquos formal resignation as Tory leader, the starting gun has been fired for the race to replace her.The nomination process will take place on Monday, with candidates requiring eight MPs to back them in order to enter the race, with the first round of voting on Thursday.The leadership contest has been shaken up by Michael Goversquos admission that he took cocaine  years ago.The Environment Secretary told the Daily Mail he ldquodeeply regrets taking cocaineldquoon several

We felt like easy targets for the Luftwaffe. \u2028“A couple of ships were hit and we just hoped and prayed that ours would not be one of the next ones. “For some reason, I remember that I did not even get my feet wet when we eventually came on shore as we were on landing craft vehicles.”Johns most vivid memory of June , , was the Armada of ships lying off-shore.

Johnston Carmichael has  offices across Scotland.It’s a gold sponsor of the Kiltwalk and teams from across the firm have been in training for months in preparation for their nearest event.

According to these three parties, the new power supply system — known as #cold ironing# — will reduce the overnight carbon footprint from the vessel’s diesel generators and engines. It is believed that this will lower the ferry#s fuel consumption by at least  tonnes a year and resulting in a signicant reduction in carbon dioxide. It is also hoped that this will make a contribution towards further reducing nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and noise.According to the organisations behind these plans, it will be £, cheaper to service MV Hamnavoe each year, as a result of the project. £, of funding was secured for the scheme from the European Regional Development Fund in August last year, with additional funding coming from OIC#s Miscellaneous Piers and Harbours fund and HITRANS.The scheme is expected to fully pay for itself in three years’ time through efficiencies and cost savings.Organisations behind the project say that other benefits will include the installation of an electric bus charger at the ferry terminal to open up opportunities for an electric vehicle to be used on the Stromness to Kirkwall route.

Having been extracted in the lab, the DNA has been sequenced and compared against known species, creating a near-definitive list of everything that lives in the loch for the first time.The results of the study were supposed to be published in January, but cataloguing the extensive range of micro-organisms and bacteria has taken longer than expected.The team has found around  dferent species of fish and up to , species of bacteria, some of which will have been deposited in Loch Ness by animals using connecting rivers.Prof Gemmell said he hoped to announce the full findings of the study at a press conference in Scotland next month.“Is there anything deeply mysterious  Hmm. It depends what you believe,” he said. “Is there anything startling  There are a few things that are a bit surprising.“What we’ll have achieved is what we set out to do, which is document the bioersity of Loch Ness in June  in some level of detail.“We’ve tested each one of the main monster hypotheses and three of them we can probably say aren’t right and one of them might be.”Although Prof Gemmell would not confirm which hypothesis might be right, the two main theories about the monster is it is a long-necked plesiosaur that somehow survived the period when dinosaurs became extinct, or it is a sturgeon or giant catfish.Prof Gemmell admitted that part of the reason for the delay in publishing the results was due to a series of failed attempts to film a television documentary.Negotiations with a series of production companies ended without a deal.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"queen s birthday honours the scottish list in full","story":"Here is a list of all the Scots honoured by Her Majesty the Queen to mark her birthday.KNIGHTS BACHELORBrian Harold Donohoe.

Political opponents have branded the move an attempt to “clean out Scotland’s coffers.”The fiscal powers effectively go “live” next yearwhen the Scottish Government faces direct responsibility for ensuring their devolved budget of about £bn is balanced with its new powers over setting income tax which came into force two years ago. But SNP ministers were left reeling when a recent report by the country’s economic watchdog, the Scottish Fiscal Commission, warned that they face a £ millionshortfall next year. This was as a result of forecasting errors by the SFC and Office for Budget Responsibilityin their estimates for income tax. This will rise to £m the following year, then £m after that.A Scottish Government spokesman said: “The Scottish Fiscal Commission’s report shows that small changes to their assumptions can be a factor in relatively large swings in income tax forecasts. “This uncertainty is compounded by having two dferent forecasters, with small dferences between them generating signicant iation in forecasts.“The size of the predicted budget adjustments makes clear that the Scottish Government’s current powers to deal with this volatility are far too limited, and that changes need to be made to the Fiscal Framework to abolish the restrictions set on the use of the Scotland Reserve.”The reserve allows ministers to draw down cash when funds revenues are lower than expected. There is expected to be about £m in the pot by the end of this year, but only £m of this could be used in  . This would not cover the £m shortfall being forecast in next year’s budget.In addition to this, Scottish ministers also have borrowing powers of up to £m they can utilise, but have indicated they are not planning to use them. Even this would still not be enough to meet the looming £m-plus shortfall next year.MSPs on Holyrood’s finance committee have raised concerns that the £bn black hole has emerged as a result of income tax forecasts errors – despite the Scots income tax being broadly in line, albeit slightly below, expectations.The main reason for the gap was the faster than anticipated rise in tax receipts south of the border as a result of increased earnings.Committee convenor Bruce Crawford warned this could mean Scotland would always be at the mercy of wages in the rest of the UK growing at a “disproportionate level” compared with Scotland.“Does it not suggest then that there’s a flaw in the way the fiscal framework operates,” he told MSPs last week.The SNP MSP also warned that the latest round of budget shortfalls may not be a one-off, adding: “We’re going to be in a competition here which we cannot win.” A review of the fiscal framework is due to be undertaken in  and ministers want the issue to looked at. A statement added: “The successful devolution of tax powers, both current and future, should ensure that tax revenues reflect Scottish performance. This is one of the areas that the Fiscal Framework Review will need to investigate.”But Tory Finance spokesman Murdo Fraser, right, warned the prospect of abolishing the cap on reserves risked plunging Scotland’s public finances into the red.“It is Derek Mackay’s job to balance the Scottish Government’s budget and protect public services,” he said.“It is not to clean out Scotland’s coffers when his plans don’t work.“The SFC have demonstrated that the SNP can’t do the maths and are poised to raid the biscuit tin.“It is only two years since income tax devolution started, under arrangements negotiated and agreed by the SNP Government. They are now admitting that they didn’t do their homework at that stage.“Extending borrowing powers simply means that future governments, and taxpayers, have to carry the can for the failures of today.”The issue could intensy over the coming yearspost-Brexit immigration curbs hit the size of Scotland’s workforce and population. It could see income tax receipts suffer and further budget shortfalls. Nationalist MSP Tom Arthur, who sits on the finance committee, added: “Leaving the EU, with or without a deal, will be devastating for Scotland’s economy.

That is way above the remain vote.Congratulations to the Liberal Democrats.The vote shows, I feel, a clear majority of people in the Shetland Islands are not anti-EU. As an SNP voter, I feel that both the Liberal Democrats and the SNP now have to demonstrate how remaining in the EU can be beneficial to the the Scottish fishingand agriculture # a very dficult task.Strong anti-Brexit result in Shetland. The European Parliament has not fallen into the hands of the far right. In Britain the total Remain vote was larger than the total Leave vote :. Fishermen will always need a market for their landings and remote farmers and crofters know Europe tries to look after them even though nationally agribusiness seeks to pocket too much subsidy. Overall a victory for hope not hate. Lest we forget what international solidarity and cooperation sounds like:Love it. What a wonderful man and what a great work – one of Europe’s greatest composers and one of Europe’s greatest poets – a sublime combination. Here’s to Europe and Europeans: Wo dein zanfter Flügel weiltThis has always been my favourite stanza, but I’ve yet to find a satisfactory English translation – one that conveys the humanity as well as the poetry. Would you happen to have one Peter as ian says your discount the exit tories and labour. and best for remain itsa draw at worse its a good win for leave.In Britain, the total Remain vote was larger than the total Leave vote :. you claim that is not true.O dear me, Peter, you have absolutely forgotten both the Tories and the Labour voters. What you have counted was the Leave without a deal of any type vote  and your figure of  includes voters who may care nothing about the EU but are considering a host of other reasons for casting their vote.LOL The London Liberals’ view of democracy:“Dear plebs, we’re honouring you by asking your advice on which of two options # Leave or Remain # you want us to adopt .” 🙂Alternative description of London Liberals:They made it % clear that they want to withdraw Article  and remain in the EU.They expressed this view in language that was so clear that not a single person could misunderstand them.Millions of London plebs agreed with them and voted Liberal, so they won the election.If you saw anything dferent John, I suspect your moving picture wireless needs re-tuning.Would you say the same about the SNP in Scotland, Malcolm Still thinking about it, Malc Not at all Brian.There’s nothing to think about.I replied to you immediately but I forgot to gentry my working-class language, so it wasn’t published.The Lib Dems in London and the SNP in Scotland had a very similar policy on Article  and EU membership.The SNP had clearly planned their strategy well in advance and provided clear guidance to their supporters who knew exactly what they were voting for.Liebe Rosa, you’ve fairly thrown down the gauntlet there!I agree, each translation has issues, but happily help is at hand within Shetland culture. Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in . The final lines guaranteed translation into many other language too:Shall brithers be for a# thatSchiller would also have recognised the romantic sensibilities which informed Shetland’s Up-Helly Aa, or unserer feuer-trunken Faschingsdeinstag, ob du wilst. I think these lines from the closing verse of The Galley Song capture Schiller’s intention perfectly:O’er stre the curtain drawHappy to see Europe inspiring Shetland still!#Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us#Unless of course they#re English eh Peter. You want to separate scotland from the rest of the UK yet come out with the PC BS above. just who are you trying to kid I wondered when the anti- English racist rhetoric would raise its ugly head on here. Rule Britannia was actually written by Thomas Arne a Roman Catholic who was proud to be British. He’d get short shrt on the so called Liberal Shetland Islands.The first  notes of Beethoven#s Fth. Lest we forget how Europe became free.And there is a big world out there we don#t need Europepo founded , napoleon long dead by then. liberals to replace lairds  look at tavish family historyThe original company originates from , with the formation of the Peninsular  Oriental Steam Navigation Company, Napolean not long dead . Napoleonic Wars were certainly consequential in the rationale behind the companies formation. Particularly the Peninsular war.It wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave. Schilleradvocated seeking broadminded and warmhearted company. Should the UK falter, will it be those who sought to continue to enjoy the benefits of the wider degree of solidarity who are really to blame I am so sorry, Peter Hamilton, Schiller died two hundred years ago. Have you someone a little more contemporary to bore us with  Tony Benn had some creative thoughts about Europe, as did Jack Jones. They were real socialists and Democrats, not pretentious windbags. Now carry on spouting, Liebe Rosa, will be most impressed. # made me realise how cushioned from the worst excesses of Tory Lib-Dem austerity we are in Scotland: free prescriptions, no bedroom tax and – of vital important to many state benefit recipients – universal credit payment choices, to name but three. This of course, was reflected in Shetland’s EU election result. My friend is planning on early retirement and swt relocation to pro-Europe Shetland.In that same spirit, and reflecting on Northern Ireland’s and Scotland’s situation, I found myself wondering how someone might feeltheir favourite pub, which offers a decent selection of bar meals, was to be burned down by their dour in-laws who run the bog standard cafe next door, all in order to secure wider access to the market.These words were in the context of his apologising to the Roma people for Catholic discrimination.They sit in contrast to Farage’s racist and isive comments regarding Romanians that some people willingly overlook.

Students have learnt about the aquacultures along the tidal zones of Skye and food practices that can support them.During the summer, three graduates of the course have been awarded a Climavore apprenticeship in restaurants across Skye and Raasay # Edinbane Lodge, Raasay House, and Scorrybreac Restaurant. Working in close collaboration with the chefs and kitchen teams, the apprentices will develop, prepare and serve Climavore dishes to support and develop alternative aquacultures that promote cleaner usage of the tidal zone.The programme will be launched with a celebratory meal on Saturday st June at the oyster table in Portree. Prepared in partnership with the pupils, diners will be treated to a lunch of scallop ceviche, oysters, seaweed soup and carrageen panna cotta, washed down with a Harris Gin and sea buckthorn cocktail.Events on Sunday nd June will include a walk to a rare native Skye oyster habitat, which will be followed by a screening of the recently-released film #Artishal# at the Aros Centre in Portree. Produced by Patagonia, #Artishal# is a film about people, rivers, and the fight for the future of wild fish and the environment that supports them. The film screening will be followed by a discussion led by environmentalist Corin Smith.Alon Schwabe of Cooking Sections explained why he believed this project was so vital. He said: #All across the Scottish isles, the United Kingdom and across the planet we are witnessing a tremendous loss of bioersity and extensive pollution of our air, land, and waterways. In the UK and all around the world, the environments we leave to future generations are in a fragile state.#Climavore questions how we eat as humans changes climate and develops programmes to provide tools to young residents of Skye to transform food practices, ecologies and environments to become better places for humans, plants and animals living along the tidal zone.#Atlas Arts producer Shona Cameron added: #Working with the students and teachers at Portree High School over the last year has been an exciting development for this project. The students have shown real enthusiasm to learn about the local ingredients and engage in conversations that question sustainability.#It has been brilliant to see restaurants across the islands continue to show enthusiasm towards the aims of Climavore and demonstrate a willingness to take on apprentices, working with them to bring Climavore dishes to their menus. It is our vision to expand the apprenticeships to more students and restaurants across the whole academic year, starting in September .#If you would like to attend these events or wish further information, you can visit atlasarts.org.uk, email shona@atlasarts.org.uk or phone  ."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/KEEP-TO-THE-LEFT-1-Copy.jpg","title":"tech giants urged to join keep left road","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineTech giants are being urged to provide an additional safety feature to stop foreign motorists from driving on the wrong side of the road.Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes has written to leading satellite navigation firms such as Apple and Google Maps to highlight the concern.Because some sat navs and smartphones give users a reminder of the speed limit, she hopes that a similar notice can be given so that tourists stay on the left-hand side.Ms. Forbes is supporting the #Keep Left# campaign, which was launched after Skye woman Sharon Anslow was injured in a collision with a tourist#s car last year.Ms Forbes said: #Nobody intentionally drives on the wrong side of the road, but clearly we#ve got to do more to remind visitors to drive on the left.#Having contacted all the car hire companies to raise awareness of this issue, I#ve started looking at other points of contact with tourists.#I#m sure that many will be using a navigation device, whether a GPS, SatNav, Google or Apple maps.#Already, these devices usually remind drivers not to touch it whilst driving and to keep to the speed limit.#I have contacted the tech companies to askthey could develop them further to remind drivers to drive on the left.#This could be done either verbally whilst driving or a warning sign before the start of a journey.

The late Peter McCambridge won his Distinguished Conduct Medal on the Longest Day - but he had, in fact, dropped into Normandy in the late evening of June , .Anyone who has seen the film of The Longest Day will remember the scenes featuring Richard Todd and the Glider troops of the Oxs and Bucks Light Infantry attacking Pegasus Bridge.Mr. McCambridge, then an NCO with the thParachute Btn. of the th Airborne Division, was fighting only yards from this famous action in the nearby village of Le Port.In later years, Peter McCambridge was a familiar figure in Ballymena. He lived at Wilson Crescent and was a keen walker. Few,any, would have known that the tall, bespectacled figure who went about his civilian le so quietly and modestly was one of the heroes of D-Day.This is what his citation recorded about the action:-  Unit : B Company, th Parachute Battalion. Service No. : . Awards : Distinguished Conduct Medal‘This NCO was one of the parachute troops who landed behind the German lines in Normandy on the night th th June . During the fighting for Beacutenouville bridge on the th June, McCambridges platoon was responsible for holding the village of Le Port. At one period his section became detached from the platoon and the fighting, which went on for  hours almost without pause, was particularly fierce. McCambridge noticed that one house dominated the scene of the fighting. By skilful use of a smoke grenade and displaying the greatest dash he got his section across a road swept by Machine Gun fire and into the house. He used anti-tank grenades to smash open the garden gate and the door of the house. Once inside the house he was completely cut off from the rest of his company, who actually had withdrawn slightly, but he was in a dominating position and became the target for the enemy who greatly outnumbered his section and were surrounding him. So well did he dispose his men however and so splendid was his leadership that he held this isolated house until the seaborne troops eventually entered the village from the other end, several hours later. At times the enemy were close enough to try and beat down the door by beating it with their rle butts - McCambridge dealt with such attacks by having grenades dropped on them from the upper windows. There is no doubt that the holding of this dominating house seriously weakened the enemy attacks and greatly assisted the battalion to carry out its job of holding the bridge. On the th June at Bois de Bavent during a company attack Sgt McCambridge, together with another NCO, saved the le of his platoon commander, who had been wounded and whose phosphorus bomb was burning in his pouch. Between them they extracted the burning bomb and dragged the officer to cover despite heavy and accurate mortar and Machine Gun fire.McCambridge has shown himself throughout the three weeks continuous fighting to be a truly magnicent NCO. He is calm, cheerful and always reliable.

The Amateurs celebrated reaching the historic milestone by holding a gala sports dinner at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel in Ballynahinch“Sixty years is a long time for a Junior or indeed an Intermediate club to keep going, especially in the modern day when there are so many other attractions,” said Mr Martin.He revealed that the Irish FA was working on a strategy to reverse the nationwide decline in the adult game, and hoped that the Amateurs would themselves benefit from this plan in the near future.Over  members, friends and former players of Dromore Amateurs enjoyed a fantastic evening at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel, Ballynahinch on April  as the club celebrated in fine style its th anniversary.Formed at the beginning of the   season, the Amateurs have maintained football in the Co Down town for six decades.Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, presents a crystal vase to Amateurs chairman Russell WardAs well as the president of the Irish FA, special guests on the night included Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, and Maurice Johnston, vice chairman of the Mid Ulster Football League.Dromore played in the Northern Amateur Football League from  to  and again from  to , before moving to the Mid Ulster Football League where they currently play in the Intermediate B Division.The compere and after-dinner speaker was BBC legend Jackie Fullerton, whose wit and charm throughout the evening brought much fun and laughter.The Ballymena man’s tales about sporting icons George Best, Joey Dunlop and Alex Higgins went down a storm with the audience.Mid Ulster Football League representatives Maurice Johnston, vice chairman, left, and Stephen Magill, honorary secretary, right, make a presentation to Russell Ward, chairman of Dromore AmateursMr Fullerton was the perfect gentleman with all he met, mingling with guests and accommodating every request for a photograph or a selfie with good grace.SpeechesThe Amateurs’ hard-working committee was delighted to secure the attendance of such a prestigious guest as the president of Irish FA.Universal Credit in Crisis: These people want you to hear their stories of le on the problem benefit before it is rolled-out even further Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"However, the pleasure was reciprocated because, of course, Mr Martin is an Amateurs old boy himself.Top goalscorer and first team player of the year Matthew Reain, centre, withcoach Keith Halliday and manager Graeme DavisHe spent  years with the club as a player and club treasurer.“I receive many invitations over the course of a year but this is one which gives me so much pleasure in being able to attend,” Mr Martin told the audience. “It was Mountview Park in  when I joined the club.“I was a second team player. Robert Gracey, Sam Vint, Aubrey Davidson, Wyn Crothers, Brendan Maginess, Philip Roy, Bernie Mackin, John Toucher and, of course, so many others, were my teammates.“They were great times, great moments. We weren’t successful, however these guys were fine clubmen.“I was treasurer from  to . We developed the clubhouse and upgraded the pitch and surroundings. We put the club on a sound financial footing before I left in  – this was achieved from a less-than-zero position in .“Suffice to say, this is where I began as a football administrator and I have always been grateful to the club for that.”Commenting on the Amateurs’ exciting plans for a new pitch and clubrooms, Mr Martin said the future was looking bright for his old club. He brought the best wishes of the Irish FA and on their behalf presented a crystal bowl to Dromore chairman Russell Ward to mark the occasion.Indeed, Mr Ward was a busy man on the night.In addition to making two fine speeches himself, the Amateurs chairman was presented with a further two pieces of crystal from Mr Pateman and Mr Johnston. Both league officials made excellent speeches during which they brought the best wishes of their respective organisations and paid generous compliments to Dromore on reaching their th anniversary.AuctionA highlight of the evening was the auction of sporting memorabilia. Hospitality tickets for a Northern Ireland game, signed shirts from Ulster Rugby and Linfield FC, and signed footballs from Rangers FC and Manchester United, all sold for very respectable sums.However, a titanic bidding war took place over a signed Liverpool FC football and the atmosphere in the room was electric as the figure kept getting higher and higher.When the auctioneer, Mr Fullerton, eventually brought the hammer down and declared ‘sold’, it was Amateurs committee member and local businessman Darren McCauley who became the new owner of the prized football.He might have paid an eye-watering amount, but being a lelong Liverpool fan and a great Dromore clubman, Mr McCauley was delighted with his purchase – and with Liverpool having won the Champions League final at the weekend, it now looks like a clever investment.With the formalities over, it was time for the band to take to the stage, and five-piece Klass proved a big hit, packing the dancefloor until the finish.AwardsThe final act of the   season came on Saturday, May  with a charity match between current players and a team of Amateurs “legends”.An entertaining game was played in a friendly but competitive spirit at the Community Centre.The youthful legs of the current players proved too much for the wise old heads of the legends. However, a clever tactical decision to play the last  minutes with  players on the pitch helped the old boys finish the game with a respectable - defeat.It was wonderful to see so many former players come along, pull the boots on and attempt to relive past glories. Special mention goes to Malcolm Hanna, who celebrated his th birthday with a sterling display in midfield.A total of £ was raised for Diabetes UK, with the costs of the day kindly sponsored by Trevor Tate and Son Transport Ltd.Afterwards, the Amateurs held their end-of-season awards presentation in the clubrooms.Chairman Russell Ward expressed his sincere thanks to the coaching staff, players and committee for all their efforts throughout the season.First team player-manager Graeme Davis was praised for guiding the Amateurs to their highest place league finish in many years.Dromore ended the season in fth positionin the Intermediate B Division of the Mid Ulster Football League.Their record was as follows: P W D L Pts .Graeme can be proud of this achievement in his debut season in charge.

The seconds finished eighthin Reserve Division Four.Their record was as follows: P W D L PtsDficult as the season proved, it was still a great learning experience for the younger players. Although there were many ups and downs over the year, the team stuck together and there was a great spirit in the changing room, right up until the last game.The award winners for both teams was dominated by young players – an encouraging sign for the future.The first teams gongs were a family affair, with the Reain brothers, Josh and Matthew, iding up the trophies between them. These two fantastic athletes will be the backbone of the first team for many years to come.Young player of the year was Matthew Briggs, who moved up from youth football and played the entire season in the first team - a tremendous achievement.In the seconds, top goalscorer Jonathan Rodgers only joined midway through the season but he is a great attacking player and is such an exciting prospect. And -year-old Nathan Thompson capped a wonderful season by taking home both the manager’s and players’ player of the year trophies. Nathan is a quiet young man – but on the pitch he makes his presence felt, and is a model defender who rarely makes a mistake.Clubman of the year was the popular Christopher Tate – a committee member and first team coach, Christopher puts his heart and soul into the club.Dromore Amateurs will hold their AGM in the clubrooms on Monday, June  at pm.

If we get Boris Johnson in as Prime Minister, God knows what’s going to happen because that man wants to bring in an amnesty. He will probably call a halt to legacy inquests, so we need to get people out on the streets at the weekend.”She continued: “The inquest won’t answer all of our questions, but at least we’re having it addressed. We had General Mike Jackson in the box who, when my brother and Mr Corr were being thrown into the back of an army vehicle, he stood round the corner saying they had engaged in two-three hour gun battle and had shot dead two gunmen. That has now been exposed – they were unarmed.“We’re  years down the line with our campaign. An inquest is something that every person is entitled to. The right to le is something that people should have in any country.”Mr Laverty’s niece, Mary-Kate Quinn, added: “The Stormont House Agreement was something that people were happy with, but all of the mechanisms are shelved. Sunday is about making sure there is a process for everybody to be involved in and asking for it to be implemented.“The Stormont House Agreement provides people with mechanisms that acknowledge their loved ones. There are people sitting who don’t even know that they have had loved ones murdered – they have no voice.We’re very lucky –you could say that – that we have a process and we’re miles ahead of everybody  because of the inquest.”She continued: “The Ballymurphy campaign and the inquest has given people hope. As a family we would like to think that it gives people hope. When the Bloody Sunday families got the outcome of their investigation it was victory for them, but it was a victory for all of us. I think this march is about hope and about demanding the rights that we’re entitled to.”The Time for Truth March will assemble at pm, Sunday th June at three points, walking to join at Belfast City Hall.

These lines of inquiry do not include the journalists, Mr Birney or Mr McCaffrey, as suspects in the investigation.“At all times, my officers have acted in good faith, within the law and followed due process. The warrant application was originally submitted to and approved by a county court judge. We do, however, accept and respect the decision of the High Court last week.“We plan to produce a final report to the Chief Constable of the PSNI outlining all of our findings.”In response PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton said: “In , PSNI became aware of an alleged theft and or unlawful leaking of sensitive documents relating to the Loughinisland investigation from the Office of the Police Ombudsman. To ensure independence and address any conflict of interest I asked Durham Constabulary to conduct the investigation.“I am grateful to Durham Constabulary and to Chief Constable Mike Barton for the work they have conducted on our behalf in this sensitive investigation. I have always accepted the autonomy of Chief Constable Barton’s inquiry and I fully concur with his decision not to progress the investigation into the two journalists Mr Birney and Mr McCaffrey.“Throughout the period of this investigation, the horror of what happened in Loughinisland has never been far from any of our thoughts. The perpetrators of that crime have never been brought to justice and that is a matter of huge regret for policing.“The police investigation into who murdered the six innocent men in the Heights Bar in  remains open but progress is dependent on new information. There are people out there who know what happened. I would appeal to them to come forward and make a statement that will help us finally bring justice to the families of the victims.“I am aware that the investigation over the last year has caused concern for families who have already suffered so much. That is something none of us would ever have wished to do.“However, as a police service, the suspected theft or unlawful leaking of any sensitive documents containing information that may endanger le is a serious matter which we are statutorily obliged to investigate.“Recognising the sensitivities, we asked an independent Police Service to conduct the investigation. The clarity provided by last week’s hearing has now brought a signicant part of that investigation to a conclusion.“I await the final report from Durham on this complex investigation.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tim and jake unveiled as feile comedy leads","story":"NORTH is set to meet West as Belfast’s comedy big hitters come together for Féile an Phobail’s annual comedy night.

We should work hard at maintaining that, picking people because they have the skills for policing, not because of their religious background.\"But given the low percentage of Catholics in the PSNI, Mr Sheridan, who now heads up cross-border charity Co-operation Ireland, said more should be done to encourage recruits from that side of the community.\"If theres a sense that somehow were going to lose that representation then I absolutely do think that people should be championing the need for people [Catholics] to join the police service,\" he said.\"Im not sure - would be the answer today because Im not sure there would be any more encouragement for young people to jointhat was the case.\"The PSNI replaced the Royal Ulster Constabularyin November , and a - recruitment policy ran for its first  years until .This meant that % of all recruits had to be from a Catholic background, and % from a Protestant or other background.

Mr Sheridan said that while it was the right strategy then, it isnt the way forward in his view.\"I was in favour of - at the time because we needed to rebalance the organisation but we shouldnt consistently need to do that,\" he said.\"We should be looking for the best people whatever their religion or gender or anything .\"The ex-head of the PSNIs Crime Operations Department also said it would be \"dangerous\" to lay the blame for this lack of Catholic recruits at the door of nationalist politicians, community leaders or any inidual.\"Its on all of us - its on our politicians, its on the community, its on the police,\" he said.\"Policing has to be reflective of society and the democracy it serves so therefore its everybodys responsibility.\"Fr Magill, whose emotive speech during the funeral of murdered journalist Lyra McKee prompted a standing ovation, said he was \"very supportive\" of what Mr Hamilton said.\"The bottom line is that Church leaders and politicians should encourage Catholics to consider a career in policing when an appropriate opportunity arises,\" he added.Mervyn Storey, the DUP MLA, said nationalist representatives must \"step up to the challenge issued by the Chief Constable to demonstrate civic leadership and properly advocate a career in policing\".He accused Sinn Fein of failing \"to step forward and demonstrate real leadership\" and slammed the SDLPs call for - recruitment to be reinstated as a \"knee-jerk response\".He added: \"It is not enough for nationalist and republican representatives to pay lip service to policing.\"Dolores Kelly said the SDLP encourages any young person from a nationalist community who is thinking about a career in policing to pursue it.\"Ending - policing has had a detrimental impact on the makeup of the PSNI. We warned the British Government against it,\" she added.\"Its time for a rethink.\"Sinn Feins Gerry Kelly accused Mr Hamilton of \"attempting to deflect from failings within policing\" by blaming political parties for the lack of young nationalist recruits.\"While I am on the record as having said my door is open to assist anyone interested in a policing career, it is not and never has been the job of any political party to recruit for the PSNI,\" he said.Ulster Unionist MLA Alan Chambers said his party has always been opposed to - recruitment and does not want to see it ."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38192996.ece/d68af/BINARY/HONOURS%20Ch%203.jpg","title":"full list of northern ireland recipients of queens birthday honours june","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

non-compliance - was the reason for Mr Downey \"being taken to task\".In final submissions, solicitors for the respondent, the PSNI, maintain there was no discrimination or victimisation and that all measures were taken on health and safety grounds.With regards to Mr Downeys claim that female officers were treated dferently, the PSNI lawyer said there \"was nothing to suggest females would have been treated any dferently\".That argument was countered with Mr Downey claiming it was all too apparent that no action was being taken against female officers \"with blonde bushy ponytails\".Previous evidence in the case centred on female officers with ponytails hanging out as they couldnt get them tucked under their helmets.Chief Inspector McCreery had earlier told the hearing he only became aware of a number of female police officers who were \"pulled to the ground and kicked\" when Mr Downey presented his case last year, but he reported breaches to his line manager as soon as he learned about them in June .He had admitted that he was not aware of any female officer being transferred as a result of breaching the policy.Mr Downeys lawyer asserted that this was an example of \"a discriminatory application of PSNI policy\", when looking at Mr Downeys case.New rules outlawing beards and facial hair were implemented last year for some units in the PSNI due to health and safety concerns."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

But how exactly are the books balanced The game will allow users to decide whats worth forking out public money on and where to make cuts.William Crawley said: “I’ve been across Northern Ireland, in our hospitals and schools to hear about the impact that increasing demand is having on our public services. \"It’s clear we as a society have many decisions to make about the best way to spend our money but it’s far from straightforward – while we would all like more money to spend, there’s only a limited amount to go around.”Tara Mills said the documentary aims to dispel the myths about how much money is raised in Northern Ireland and how much comes from Westminster.“We bring together dferent groups of people to pretend to be Finance Minister for the day. It’s fascinating to see where they would like to see money spent – and who would lose out,\" she said.Spend It Like Stormont will air on BBC One Northern Ireland at pm on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"oops sinn fein press advisor accidentally sends mass email asking about redundancy","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Trump is somewhat dferent, though.Sources say the US President told Taoiseach Leo Varadkar that he always thinks of the Republic as \"a huge country\" because of the impact its people have had. Varadkar happily told him the country has just five million people.It was one of the lighter moments in a meeting that briskly moved from serious topics to sport. Brexit, immigration and all featured, before conversation swayed to The Open. At one point the Irish side found itself explaining how, for some sports, the whole island plays as one team, while for others, there are Republic and Northern Ireland teams. The US President was fascinated. Insiders say the atmosphere was \"warm\", which probably matched the temperature in the makesht meeting room that was dressed up with a few net curtains and colourful flowers. On the American side, Trump had some big hitters, but they didnt throw any punches. There was his Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, National Security Advisor John Bolton and Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin. Varadkars back-up team included his Chief of Staff, Brian Murphy, main Brexit brain John Callinan, US envoy John Deasy and Ambassador Dan Mulhall. Even before the meeting began, it was obvious Trump was in a good mood. He allowed journalists to fire questions at him for eight minutes without trading any insults. He also denied being in Ireland to play golf and promote his hotel but struggled to show that he had done any actual preparation for the meeting. The Taoiseach was brave enough to publicly correct him when he tried to compare the Irish border situation with his plans to build a wall between the US and Mexico. \"His basic knowledge isnt great,\" a source admitted. However, Mr Varadkar insisted afterwards that the purpose of the meeting was to educate the US delegation.Soon, Trump and his we, Melania, were on board a chopper bound for Doonbeg. Irish officials were more than a little relieved. Mr Varadkar went on to defend the cost of providing , unormed and  specialist gardai for the trip. \"The good bilateral relationship between Ireland and America is worth a lot more than €m,\" he said. Trump is unlikely to have taken in much of what was said, but he didnt call anybody, including Michael D Higgins, a stone cold loser. No real damage done, then, which is the best they could have hoped for. There was no mention of wind turbines or fake news. \"I learn from my mistakes,\" the Taoiseach laughed as he left the post-match analysis session.  data-dfpadtargeting and First Lady Melania Trumpdisembark Air Force One upon arrival at Shannon Airport in Shannon, County Clare, Ireland on June , .

I believe we have achieved this outcome with the design incorporating the Mourne mountains, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoI am also pleased that dedicated motorhome bays have been provided in Castle Park and that the spaces are being well used.Cllr Clarke said it was important that the local authority works with motorhome owners as Newcastle and the wider region needed to be a welcoming place for visitors.He added: ldquoIt has to be recognised that displacement of motorhome and camper vans from the Downs Road and Glen River car parks had to be accommodated whereI believe it is essential that

obesity epidemic  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council is aiming to help fight the growing obesity crisis across Northern Ireland.Local politicians are gearing up to declare war on the issue and implement a new policy that will result in high sugar items such as sweets, fizzy drinks and high fat snacks being banned from vending machines in council buildings across the district, including its leisure centres.The high sugar items will be replaced with healthy choice snacks and drinks with local politicians hoping that other organisations across the district, which have vending machines in their buildings, will follow suit.A number of local schools have already banned chocolates and crisps from their vending machines with politicians keen to lead from the front in encouraging people to eat more healthily and exercise regularly.Last year, the local authority launched a new app to make it easier for residents across the district to take part in sport and leisure activities and receive up-to-date information about the local authorityrsquos leisure facilities.Now it wants to go a step further to help improve peoplersquos health.The move to ban high fat and sugary items from vending machines across council buildings, which will be formally discussed later this month, comes after it emerged this week that sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks could soon be sold under cigarette-style plain packaging under plans by a number of leading brands to help combat the obesity epidemic.A recent Department of Health survey revealed that that % of people in Northern Ireland were overweight, with % classed as obese with councillors acutely aware that obesity continues to be one of the most important public health challenges.They recognise that being overweight or obese increases the risk of le threatening disease, with its costs extending far beyond the public sector, affecting iniduals, families, communities, the economy and society as a whole.At Monday nightrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority, politicians agreed to debate the possible ban and view the move as an important step towards tacking the obesity issue.They aim to encourage people to opt for healthier food choices and to change their diet as part of the drive to create an environment that supports and promotes a physically active lestyle and healthy diet.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke, who is spearheading the drive to ban sugary snacks and drinks from council vending machines, said he hopes it will empower people to make healthier choices and reduce the risk of overweight and obesity related diseases.He said tackling childhood obesity was already a public health priority and was keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it could at a time when research suggested that one in four children across the island of Ireland carried excess weight.Cllr Clarke said that without action to reverse current trends, the next generation will be beset with signicant ill-health related issues linked to obesity, most of which are potentially preventable.ldquoI am keen for the local council to introduce a new policy to effectively ban high fat and sugary foods and drinks from vending machines across its facilities and replace them with healthy options, he explained.ldquoI also hope that the local authorityrsquos many partner organisations will follow suit. We do not want to see obesity becoming a social norm and I believe we can help make a dference by exercising greater control over what items are in vending machines in all council buildings.Cllr Clarke said he viewed a ban on sugary snacks and drinks as ldquojust the start of a concerted campaign to help tackle obesity and get people move towards healthier lestyles.ldquoI think it is important that the council takes the lead on an issue which everyone can support. It is essential people signicantly reduce their intake of unhealthy food and drinks, he said.The local councillor also suggested that the local authority should offer politicians healthy options when they arrive for their tea ahead of the monthly council meetings.ldquoHealthy options featuring salads, fruit and vegetables should also be on the menu at council-organised s so people can choose to eat healthily. While I want the council to take the lead on this issue, I hope many other bodies it works alongside will follow suit.ldquoWorking together we can make a dference and help people change their lives. The councilrsquos lead on this issue could have a ripple effect across the district beyond.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThis is not about being a kill joy but encouraging people to be more health conscious when it comes to what they eat and drink and is the first step in a process..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Countdown to DownTime summer festival  ","story":"THE countdown is on for this monthrsquos spectacular DownTime summer festival which has something for everyone.Organisers of the four-day community event mdash which kicks off on June  mdash are promising a sparkling festival of fun which includes two daysrsquo of not-to-be-missed horse racing at the widely acclaimed Downpatrick track.Horse racing first took place at in Downpatrick in  and for almost  years the local track has been constantly improving, boasting great racing, modern facilities, themed race days and a rather unique atmosphere.DownTime summerfest has been organised by a dedicated local team from all sectors of the community whose aim is to get people out and about not just over the four-day festival, but across the summer.Now in its second year, the festival is supported by Newry, Mourne and Down Council and features over  events covering arts, heritage, music, food and, of course, sport.There will be street art, live music, theatre performances, free train rides, a living history Viking encampment at the St Patrick Centre and an artisan market mdash which will be open between am and .pm mdash cradled in the grounds of the Down County Museum.Locals and visitors alike will experience a haven of freshly produced food, bespoke crafts and relaxing surroundings.

Apart from a host of blister complaints, the bulk of real casualties were a handful of people taken to Downe Hospital suffering from heat exhaustion.One woman suffering from exhaustion had to be taken by an RAF helicopter to the Red Cross mobile treatment room and a man, who was knocked unconscious when a small boulder struck him on the head, was also taken to hospital.Despite minor upsets, the whole day was a big success story.

He started out on his footballing journey as a fresh-faced teenager in the mid s alongside his brother Denis, the McClurgs and Pattersons at Kilmore United, and was an integral part of the embryo that was to become Kilmore Rec.Originally from Inch, just outside Downpatrick, Cyril followed Denis to Killyleagh YCin  and that was the start of a close link with the club that lasted the best part of  years.He spent a decade at The Showgrounds before moving to Drumaness Mills where he again endeared himself to all at Meadowvale with his goals and whole-hearted play.When he hung up his boots in the mid s he bided his time before taking up the role as manager at Drumaness with his pal Paul Gelston mdash he also had managerial spells at Ballynahinch Unitedand Kilmore Rec.However, in  he ed to The Showgrounds to team up with Dee Heron and together they set about building one of the best team sides to play in the Amateur League.They won everything there was to win with the exception of the Intermediate Cup.They lted the Steel  Sons, Border and Clarence Cup with regularity, as well as six Amateur League Premier Section titles in a row.In addition to his time at Killyleagh, Cyril was Heronrsquos assistant with the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team and also teamed up with Nortelrsquos Ricky Beggs as manager of the Amateur League U- youth team for three years.In more recent years Cyril, although he wasnrsquot attached to any club, still followed the highs and lows of all local outfits and loved nothing better than travelling to watch Northern Ireland.Sincere condolences are expressed to his we Betty, daughters Jenner, Pamela and Heather, and extended family circle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Walking along path of history on the Camino pilgrimage  ","story":"THE faint sound of a church bell ringing in the distance, a cockerel crowing under a leafy olive grove at sunrise or the thunderous crash of an Atlantic wave as it beats off a rocky shoreline in northern Portugal became a welcome replacement to the bustle of Downpatrick last month.For  days, my friend Shona and I ventured the -mile trek of the Camino Portuguese from the beautul and vibrant city of Porto to Santiago de Compostela in neighbouring Galicia, in northern Spain.Time stood still as we listened to the rhythmic crunch of sandy gravel underfoot and breathed in the soft pine-scented woodland pathways that led to an ever increasing number of pilgrims making their way up through the captivating beauty of the Camino da Costa mdash just one of many routes leading to the famous cathedral which is the final resting place of St James the Apostle.Our journey began after a seriously hearty breakfast in one of the many fabulous street-side cafes in Porto on Thursday, May . The traditional merchant city is situated on the lsquoRiver of Goldrsquo. It was here in the th century that Portugal took its name. Much of its fine architecture in the old medieval quarter and a mandatory wine tasting session of the world famous ruby-port wine warrant atrip in itself some day.Hugging the coastline, this first stage meanders along a low lying shoreline of boardwalks and sand dunes to Vila do Conde where we took lodging for the night in a guest house as the townrsquos albergue offered only mattresses in a hallway.Day two saw us slowly begin to adapt to the rigours and demands of the Camino. I secretly longed for the day to be over before it began and was relieved that not just a few of us were wondering the same thing. Yet,  miles later, with a one and a half stone weight packed inside our rucksacks and the unwelcome emergence of a cluster of painful blisters forming, we were singing with joy as we arrived at the popular surfing resort of Esposende in the Braga district later that afternoon.Day three began in much the same way, neither of us forgetting the miracle cure that can be derived from a good nightrsquos sleep. We crossed the Rio Nieve to the first of two  foot peaks leading to Viana do Castelo where the majestic Monte Santa Luzia stands atop of a steep hill overlooking yet another captivating beachside town.Half way between Esposende and Viana do Castelo is Igreja Santiago de Castelo do Neiva, where an altar inion relating to St James and dated  AD was found during the reconstruction of the church. This is the oldest consecration to the apostle to be found outside Spain and has put this relatively recent route firmly on the official routes map for pilgrims.Onwards we hiked to Caminha on day four, where more beach board walks, pebbled pathways and sand dunes morphed into woodland trails, offering welcoming shade from the midday sun. Another steady uphill climb helped us reach here before crossing the Spanish-Portuguese border the next day.Farmers still tend their crops by hand in this part of the world, which harks back to a bygone era, leaving it untouched by modern intensive farming methods and giving us a window on the past.The fth leg of our journey began by being ferried across the border in a row boat which had a small motor installed, leaving behind the harbour town of Caminha for the Spanish town of Garda a few short miles round the bay.Further up the coast we trekked, for -and a-half miles until we reached the quaint seaside hamlet of Oia and its famous Cistercian monastery, Real Monasterio de Oia, which dates back to .By this stage our trek was getting easier as we adapted to the distances we were hiking each day. By way of a measuring stick as to how far wersquod come, we got chatting to a couple from Kent who had made their way to a villa they had rented out for a short break.They had driven from Porto in a hired car up the motorway the day before and it took them  minutes. It had taken us five gruelling, but extraordinarily peaceful days to reach the same point and we laughed at how easy it could have been.Each day we handed over our pilgrim passport to be stamped by church sacristans, post office workers, tourist office clerks, cafe and hostel owners, each of them eager to put their mark on our pilgrim way as we followed another hand-painted yellow arrow or scallop shell, dutully painted and maintained by locals proud to be part of a , year-old Christian pilgrimage, which has exploded in popularity in recent years not only with Christians, but also with the unbeliever, the doubter, the atheist and the sceptic mdash all eager to take on its challenges in a bid to escape the rigours and stress of modern day le.Each day too locals seemed to appear out of the midsts, asby magic, beckoning us with a whistle or a car horn to prompt us to turn aroundwe had mistakenly taken a wrong route mdash for which we were very grateful because each step we took seemed to matter a great deal.On day six the town of Moughas gave way to the mountain village Baiona, from where we walked to Ramallosa, famed for its historic sites and narrow medieval streets.Day seven presented a continuous series of spectacular vistas, each imprinted upon our minds until the day we die, such was their beauty, until we reached the large city of Vigo.Between Ramallosa and Vigo we met with a retired local man out walking his dog along the seashore. Silently he studied the two of us slouched exhausted over a park bench at mid morning. We could almost hear the mechanisms at play within his mind.ldquoWhere are you from  he enquired in a fair attempt at English.ldquoNorthern Ireland, we both replied, knowing that he was going to say something witty.ldquoAh, Paddies, he said, aswaiting our next move in a chess game.Ah, you must be Pedro, we retorted, intending no harm.ldquoWhere are you walking to  he enquired.ldquoSantiago de Compostela in Galacia, we both said.It was a trigger. After telling us quite succinctly what, over the last several decades, he had slowly come to realise le was about and how it should be lived, he asked: ldquoWhy are you doing it Neither of us was prepared for his directness but I showed him my rosary beads nonetheless. ldquoItrsquos a sacrice, I said straight out. He paused before he shook his head and said: ldquoYoursquoll never make it.As he watched us stand up he was only too eager though to hold our rucksacks as we reached into them again after our short but thought provoking rest.After wishing us buen Camino, he asked us to remember him when we reached the tomb of St James.Day eight and the noise and bustle of Vigo soon gave way to  feet and a steady climb of mountainous terrain and shady woodland trekking until we reached the refreshingly rural town of Redondela.Quiet country lanes led to  miles of more pebbled rustic pathways and stony gravel lanes on day nine until we reached the city of Pontevedra. As good fortune would have it, Friday, May , was a public holiday across Galacia and every shop, except cafes and wine bars were closed. We did mange to explore the magnicent Roman town though in the evening, but our bank balance didnrsquot suffer too much.Pontevedra paved the way on day ten with more forest trails and waterfalls. Our first climb of the day was to Caldas de Reis, home of the famous volcanic foot spa where for centuries pilgrims have been dipping their sore and weary feet in water of  degrees.Our penultimate day saw us take on the dizzy heights of Mount Corgullion before reaching the famous city of Padron, where we sampled the world famous padron peppers with dinner in the evening.Padron is  miles south of Santiago and is the starting point of St Jamesrsquos ministry in Spain and to where his remains were brought following his martyrdom in Jerusalem. His remains were later taken to the cathedral in Santiago where they lie in a tomb.We gazed in awe at the great Jacobean treasure and the original stone mooring post of Padron, from which the town gets its name.On the twelfth day a final temptation presented itself in the form of a train station that was situated directly opposite our lodgings that evening. Fellow pilgrims laughed at the idea that a train would take us to Santiago in  pain-free minutes,we werenrsquot up to the final trek and the almost , feet climb.I wasnrsquot laughing. I seriously eyed up the possibility, going as far to check train times. It was a stroke of good luck when I learned there was no other half way stop between Padron and Santiago. After what we had endured over the last  days, not to walk the final few miles would have been an obvious regret.And so we reached Santiago on foot shortly after pm on May , overjoyed and in a state of euphoria. The city of Santiago was worth the hike. Itrsquos as beautul and charming as it is captivating.The camaraderie and craic shared among all us pilgrims who made it from Porto to Santiago that day was incomparable to anything I have encountered before. The memories will stay with me until the day I die..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/farming/resources/images/4783733.jpg","title":"line up of calves win over judges at calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

The PSNI will not make such a decision in isolation.”Asked what advice police could give to motorists faced with long delays for an appointment, the PSNI said: “Keep checking the online booking portal for cancellations. Carry your appointment letter with you.”Charlene out to strike a gender balance in the music industry\"  \"  Reported On This Day : Murdering Irish peer is pardoned by King George II Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Cousens said: “If not quickly resolved, lawful drivers could be unfairly penalised for an issue outside of their control.“It’s not just the private motorist at risk either, as delivery vans are being caught up in the backlog. As the majority of freight is moved by road, inaction could dent the Northern Irish economy.“In previous periods of delay, Stormont has allowed exemptions to affected vehicles while the backlog is cleared. We hope that this can be repeated again while a long-term solution is sought.”Almost , more tests than normal were made in the first three months of this year.The Department of Infrastructure has said additional staff are being recruited and “urgent consideration” is being given to the possibility of opening testing centres on Sundays for a limited period of time in order to address the current backlog.try catch  TrendingMOT delays: PSNI in talks about relaxing rules for affected driversIncreasing concern for N.I. teen who has vanishedSinger Malachi Cush lsquostablersquo in RVH following road collisionN.I.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

My own view on moving forward is that a final say Peoplersquos Vote on any Brexit deal is the best option.It was a really positive event, and thank you to all constituents who attended. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Renewed weakness was evident within services, retail and construction. All three of these sectors signalled a signicant decline in activity in April.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mannnn.jpg","title":"manufacturing is ni bucking the global slowdown","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Global manufacturing and industry stalwarts such as Germany are feeling the slowdown. So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG.

Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
