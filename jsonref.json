The list is intended to mark the 200th anniversary of Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, widely seen as the progenitor of the English-language novel.The books chosen by the panel are those that have made a personal impact on them, and are ided into 10 categories. These include “love, sex and romance”, which features titles ranging from Jilly Cooper’s Rivals to Judy Blume’s Forever “identity”, which moves from Toni Morrison’s Beloved to Zadie Smith’s White Teeth and “adventure”, which includes Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials, Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe and Raymond Chandler’s The Big Sleep.“So many amazing novels are not on the list,” said Dawson. “As this panel of judges, we’re not qualified to say this is the definitive list, but we are qualified to say these are our favourites. We knew right from the beginning that the role of these lists, almost, is for people to disagree with them … and we could only pick 100 books.”So while there’s no Wuthering Heights, the Brontë sisters do feature on the list with Anne Brontë’s The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. And while Moby-Dick doesn’t appear, Herman Melville does – with Bartleby, the Scrivener.She added that she had pushed for more children’s and young adult titles to be included on the list, “because if it weren’t for the books we loved as children, we wouldn’t be readers as adults”. So alongside Orlando, Middlemarch and Our Mutual Friend, the list also features The Witches, The Hunger Games, Noughts and Crosses and The Earthsea trilogy.BBC Arts director Jonty Claypole said the list took “months of enthusiastic debate” to put together. “There are neglected masterpieces, irresistible romps as well as much-loved classics. It is a more erse list than any I have seen before, recognising the extent to which the English-language novel is an art form embraced way beyond British shores,” he said.The unveiling of the list launches a year-long celebration of literature at the BBC, headed by the new BBC Two series Novels That Shaped Our World. Beginning on 9 November, the series will explore the novel from the perspective of women’s voices, the empire and working-class experience."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/300b43314e1b6834f2e3b2e2d76a40bd6959e90f/0_656_3941_2364/master/3941.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0e609b1aee23b193193371704672431","title":"man in the red coat julian barnes","story":"A virtuoso gynaecologist is placed skilfully at the centre of a web of connections in an era of Parisian decadenceAmong all the inely swaggering paintings in the John Singer Sargent exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in 2015, one in particular seemed to sing out from the wall. In Dr Pozzi at Home a man in his prime, assured and desirable, with a fine intelligent face and trimmed dark beard and moustache, stands at ease in a full length scarlet robe the robe gives him a Renaissance magnificence but doesn’t look like fancy dress – he’s a man of the late 19th century to his fingertips. And as Julian Barnes says, the fingers are “the most expressive part of the portrait”, tapering and sensitive: “we might think him a virtuoso pianist”. Samuel-Jean Pozzi wasn’t a pianist, though, but a virtuoso gynaecologist, a brilliant and humane innovator in women’s medicine. Judging from contemporary photographs of the doctor, Sargent has purged in painting him a hint of complacency, jolliness, eagerness to please – he may have been less dreamy than his portrait and more affable.Starting out from the painting, Barnes sets out to discover more about Pozzi, and then builds around him, through a dense web of connections and relations, an involving study of a slice of the French past. The story opens in 1885 when the doctor, aged 38, arrives in London with two improbable travelling companions, for what they call “intellectual and decorative shopping”: meaning they go to Liberty’s (where Pozzi will order 30 rolls of “seaweed-coloured curtain material”), and to the Grosvenor Gallery to see the Edward Burne-Jones (French aesthetes often preferred the faux-medievalism of English painting to impressionist experiments going on at home). Henry James takes them to dinner at the Reform Club. Pozzi’s two friends are the Prince de Polignac and Count de Montesquiou-Fezensac they are improbable because, however inspired and successful the doctor, and however princely Sargent has made him look, he is by his birth and profession irremediably bourgeois. His grandfather was a patissier, his father a Protestant pastor, and Pozzi has risen through good fortune, along with his own efforts and his wife’s money, into the upper tiers of French society, which, despite several revolutions and much turbulence, is still cut fiercely across by caste distinctions.In his portrait the doctor’s swagger is unmistakably sexual, too – Barnes says the scarlet gown’s tassels look like a “bull’s pizzle”. To the lifelong chagrin of his wife Thérèse and his adoring, jealous daughter, Pozzi is incorrigibly a womaniser another difference between him and his two companions in London, in that they are both homosexual – Montesquiou is supposed to be the model for Marcel Proust’s Baron de Charlus, as well as for Jean des Esseintes in Joris-Karl Huysmans’s À Rebors. Yet they like him, and long after the tetchy and contemptuous Montesquiou has broken off friendships with many others – including with de Polignac, whose mariage blanc with an American lesbian is much too happy for Montesquiou’s liking – his fondness for Pozzi seems to endure. So how does Pozzi carry off this social adventure, his success? Because success it is: apart from in his domestic life, there’s no social reckoning, no downfall – that is, until the last, shocking hours of his existence, the unforeseeable denouement. Pozzi knew everyone and was visible everywhere in French progressive society and politics, a committed Dreyfusard in his late 60s, stouter and greyer, he is still handsome in his lieutenant-colonel’s uniform in the first world war, capably managing a military hospital – 50 beds for wounded, 25 for syphilitics. No doubt he is genial, “an adroit social tactician”, with “the bourgeois pleasure of pleasing” – as opposed to Baudelaire’s “aristocratic pleasure of displeasing”. But it has to be more than that: even an incorrigible nostalgic such as Montesquiou, scornful of what is contemporary, must be drawn partly to Pozzi’s energy, his indefatigable work ethic and his air of belonging to the future his cheerful rationality and commitment to science.Women, apart from the ones in his immediate family, have reason to be grateful to him. He translates Joseph Lister’s work on antiseptic surgery into French and introduces new standards of antisepsis, leading the way in making an incision into the abdominal cavity a relatively benign operation. He removes innumerable ovarian cysts: these cysts can weigh more than several babies, and contain litres of fluid: “the streets had been largely cleared of women tottering painfully along behind grotesquely inflated stomachs”. He visits and learns from the innovative Mayo Clinic in America, and is among the innovators using clamps for compressing blood vessels, and “thin rods of soluble caramel to hold the artery in place while suturing with the finest of embroidery stitches”. Best of all, he is not knife-happy: wisely he warns that surgery should only be used as a last resort – at a time when other doctors are merrily removing ovaries to cure nervous troubles. Pozzi has frescoes painted on the walls of his clean, airy hospitals, to aid patients’ recovery and although he has many private patients in high society – the women he mingled with at parties trust him with their intimate sufferings – he works primarily in state-run hospitals for the general population.Does Pozzi perform abortions? Barnes does not discuss the possibility, but it’s not unthinkable that this agnostic Darwinist might have helped women needing that particular procedure. He gives his friend Montesquiou a jokey written pledge, in return for a copy of a book, promising to keep Bed No 1 at his hospital at the disposal of any woman Montesquiou sends him it’s tempting to read this as joshing between one man of the world and another, offering assistance for a lover’s awkward problems with his mistresses – and conveniently keeping afloat a fiction of Montesquiou’s heterosexuality. Who knows? Barnes insists time and again that there is so much “we cannot know” that biography “is a collection of holes tied together with string”. We perceive these days an uneasy contradiction between Pozzi the doctor transforming women’s lives through medicine and Pozzi the womaniser, making his wife miserable with his succession of lovers – including probably Sarah Bernhardt, Bizet’s widow, the poet Judith Gautier, several actresses and, finally, cultured, music-loving Emma Fischoff, who becomes his life companion after his eventual separation from Thérèse. At a Medical Students’ Ball, senior doctor Pozzi hoists a naked girl up on to the stage, kisses her on the mouth, and then, turning to the rioting crowd, makes “a gesture as if to say, ‘Do as I do.’” Perhaps there is no contradiction: both careers exuberantly express male energy, male power and achievement, at a time when these could appear unproblematically progressive, and when critique was most likely to come from the forces of social conservatism, and the church.Barnes tells us that he immersed himself in these past French lives partly as a respite from “Britain’s deluded, masochistic departure from the European Union”, and as a gesture against insularity. And indeed it is salutary to be so thoroughly submerged – even sometimes to the point of drowning – in abundant detail from the “distant, decadent, hectic, violent, narcissistic and neurotic Belle Epoque”, with all its fascination and its difference from us. The past liberates us from the shallowness of our absorption in the present, and reminds us that we always know less than we think about what we’re doing.• The Man in the Red Coat is published by Jonathan Cape (£18.99).

He had entered the US on a Yugoslav passport, but in his absence Bosnia became independent following a referendum. Serbian nationalists, backed by the Milošević government in Belgrade, refused to accept the results. They took over towns and villages where Serbs were in the majority and started massacring other ethnic groups. Within a couple of months, Hemon’s native Sarajevo was under siege: his parents caught the last train out of the city. He was then in Chicago, crashing at an acquaintance’s flat.Desperate, and without a country to call his own, he began to live in the world of letters – much like Joyce 100 years ago. He went quickly from being a Bosnian writer to a shrewd prose stylist in English. By the turn of the millennium he had published The Question of Bruno, his first book of stories. He wrote for Esquire, the Paris Review and the New Yorker. His novels and essays regularly won prizes and fellowships. The success, the spectacular reversal of fortune, was in one sense quintessentially American. But Sarajevo remained a point of departure in all his work, a lost Eden shattered by snipers and tanks. War keeps inevitably cropping up on the sidelines of his vision, most acutely in his shorter fiction. It renders poignant a father’s wish to make a film about his life in “The Bees, Part I” it colours the memory of a family reunion in “Exchange of Pleasant Words”. Inherent in Hemon’s repeated reimagining of his own odyssey and his desire to recall Sarajevo before the war is the question: what did peace even feel like?In two new memoirs published in one volume, Hemon attempts a nostalgic answer. They are composite portraits of Tito’s lapsed Yugoslavian project, a “framework” into which Hemon’s parents grew, since it provided a way out of poverty and generations of ethnic strife. They could move out of their respective villages thanks to such benevolent postwar policies as mandatory free education and a recognition of women’s rights. They met in Belgrade while still in college, worked in state-owned companies and lived in state-subsidised housing. They saw their own futures as intimately aligned with that of the new nation, and volunteered in youth brigades, taking part in choreographed celebrations of patriotism. Their son, however, despised the collective optimism. At 16, he quoted the Sex Pistols to his parents during arguments, and fancied himself a Bosnian Holden Caulfield.The older Hemon knows better. His feelings about his mother’s socialist lifeline have changed: “Now I envy her I envy the sense that she was building something larger.” His parents ended up as refugees in Canada in 1993. They moved into the 15th floor of an apartment building in Hamilton, Ontario – “There was so much nothing in their new place they could not begin to fill it up.” War had wiped out their faith in reality, their sense of fulfilment in working towards something better for their children. They barely knew anyone in Canada they scarcely spoke any English. They began afresh in late middle age, working multiple jobs. By 2000, they had saved up enough money to buy a house. Now in their 80s, his parents run an apiary out of their backyard – “Hemon’s Honey” – and every spring they make a trip to their old apartment in Sarajevo, “where they spend most of their time … getting the news on who has died since last year, who might go before their next visit”. Hemon recognises traces of the broken Yugoslav dream in their belief that food “can never be a matter of mere leisure” and the contentment they seem to derive from work for work’s sake.This Does Not Belong to You is different: Hemon seems responsible here not to his parents, only to his boyhood self. In vignettes rarely more than a page long, he chronicles his earliest memory, his first love, the first time he was beaten up, an entire day spent with his sister breaking dishes in a garbage dump: “Now I realise it was one of the happiest days of my childhood, perhaps of my entire life.”The short, dense passages never feel arbitrary. He is able to recreate the process of recovering memories on the page. War seems like an impossibility, and we inhabit what it was like to grow up in the shadow of a paternalistic regime, where everything seemed fully established – “all the points and objects fixed, all the hierarchies and structures unalterable”. The focus is on lesser acts of damage, a tape recorder he took apart in a fit of adolescent curiosity, the shops that were razed in his Sarajevo neighbourhood to build high-rises and supermarkets. Forgetting is the worst crime, because “what could not be recollected never happened and was hence passed over in silence”.

All three are more than 15 years old.Flight tracking site Flight Aware shows that DCL and DAL are both currently in a known plane repair site, the Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville, California.The third plane, DCJ, is in storage at Stansted airport in London.A copy of internal Ryanair engineering logs, seen by the , lists all three as having “pickle fork cracks”.On Monday, Ryanair did not respond to detailed questions about the aircraft. A spokesman said it was continuing to review aircraft in line with the US Federal Aviation Authority, and “did not expect any impact on its operations or fleet availability”.On Tuesday, after being presented with more evidence, a spokeswoman subsequently added that the airline did not expect “this tiny number of findings” would “have any impact on our operations or our fleet availability”.She said Ryanair had completed all inspections on planes with over 30,000 lifetime flight cycles, and is currently inspecting those under 30,000, and had not found any further issues.A cycle is one take-off and one landing.The airline owns more than 450 737-NGs, which are the affected model. However, there is no suggestion any other of their planes have been affected.The pickle fork is a large structure that strengthens the connection between the wing and the body of the plane. Cracks were first found on 737s in China, prompting an urgent check.On 3 October, the US Federal Aviation Authority issued an urgent directive that all 737s above 30,000 flight cycles should be checked within a week.Ryanair would not say how many flight cycles the three grounded planes had completed.According to publicly available flight records, DCL suddenly stopped flying after 3 October. DAL and DCJ also stopped flying within a week of 3 October.According to Ryanair, the average age of their existing 737s is six-and-a-half years.According to the US FAA directive of 3 October, all 737s over 30,000 cycles needed to be urgently checked within seven days. Those between 22,600 and 30,000 needed to be checked within 1,000 cycles (approximately seven months, depending on frequency).However, last week Australia’s Qantas discovered cracks in three planes that were below the 30,000 limit. The three planes were at roughly 27,000 cycles.As a result, the Australian airline fast-tracked the checking process, examining all 33 of its 737s above 22,600 cycles within a week, rather than seven months.Ryanair did not respond when asked if it would do the same. The airline would not disclose how many planes were above 30,000 cycles, 27,000 cycles or 22,600.In Australia, Qantas rejected appeals to ground all its 737s, or to conduct checks of those below 22,000 cycles – of which it had 42.Globally, there are over 7,000 737-NGs in service. So far, Boeing has checked 1,000 aircraft and discovered faults in 50 of them.This includes nine in South Korea, three belonging to Southwest Airlines in the US, and 11 owned by Brazilian airline Gol. The pickle fork issue is separate to issues with the 737 Max, which is a newer model of plane designed to replace the current 737s.Last week, Virgin Australia said it had 19 737s over 22,600 cycles and none had cracks. Qantas said on Friday it had checked all 33 planes above 22,600 cycles, and found no further cracks.Dr Garth Pearce, a senior lecturer in aerospace engineering at the University of New South Wales, said the presence of cracks was not a threat to safety.He said that as long as airlines followed the regulator’s requirements – checking older planes within a week, and other planes within seven months – that would satisfy his safety concerns.“These parts, in addition, are designed to be very tolerant of small cracks,” he said. “The fact that this incident occurred is not a scandal, it shows the industry is working as expected.“This whole process shows that regulation really does work in the aerospace industry … I wouldn’t recommend that airlines do anything other than what the regulator asked them.”He added that the percentage of cracks would drop, as the inspectors started looking at newer and newer planes.Last month, Boeing designated Victorville as the repair site for pickle fork cracks, as reported by Bloomberg.A spokesman for Boeing said it would “not provide list of customers impacted”.Ryanair has also been hit by delays to its large order of Boeing 737 Max planes, which are currently grounded worldwide as regulators test Boeing’s solution to software problems.The chief executive, Michael O’Leary, said: “We have reduced our expectation of 30 Max aircraft being delivered to us in advance of peak summer 2020 down to 20 aircraft and there is a real risk of none.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6a78729114b1b656264e4df16b884c5a6fa70f4/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9344930c02343abb325df605ca3ccb16","title":"posh crumpets are a thing says waitrose and so is celery juice","story":"Supermarket survey reports boom in vegan ready meals, tahini, something called ‘seaganism’ and … oh yes ... kebabs are backThe humble crumpet has benefited from a “posh” makeover inspired by top chefs, sales of celery juice have soared after becoming an instagram favourite and consumers are now mad for tahini, according to a report on this year’s food and drinks trends.The findings in the annual – and seventh consecutive – food and drink report from Waitrose come as what we choose to eat assumes an increasingly important focus in the climate crisis debate, as consumers deliberately cut their meat consumption.It also shows that as the plant-based food revolution continues to sweep the UK, sales of vegan ready meals have leapfrogged their vegetarian equivalents.The Waitrose report is based on its supermarket and online sales this year, and a poll of 2,000 adults who shop across a range of retailers.So-called “seaganism” – a vegan diet which includes sustainable seafood – has also become popular, as has “seacuterie” – a fish-based version of charcuterie using seafood which orginated in Australia.Nearly one in three shoppers said they plan to reduce their consumption of meat and fish even more over the next two years, but when they do choose to put meat on their plates more than a quarter admit they want better quality products.Tor Harris, Waitrose head of corporate social responsibility, said: “We’re seeing a more considered approach to meat.

Data firm Markit reports that the eurozone’s private sector barely grew last month (despite the pick-up in German factory orders reported this morning).Weakness was centred on the manufacturing economy, where another marked fall in new orders was recorded, whilst there was also a sharp reduction in foreign demand.Overall exports were down for a thirteenth successive month, with the rate of decline amongst the sharpest in the series history. Its Eurozone Composite PMI index has come in at 50.6, up from 50.1 in September, but still close to stagnation.There remained a ergence between the manufacturing and service sectors during October. Whereas manufacturing firms recorded a ninth successive month of declining production, service sector companies indicated further growth, albeit at the second-weakest rate since January. But encouragingly, German, France and Italy all reported stronger service sector PMIs than predicted this morning.This lifted the eurozone’s Service Sector PMI to 52.2 in October, up from September’s 51.6. That shows faster growth, but is also the second-lowest reading since January. Service sector companies reported a small rise in new business volumes was signalled during October, although exports fell for the 14th month in a row.Backlogs of work fell for a third successive month, keeping employment growth at an eight-month low.M\u0026ampS suffered some serious supply chain problems this year, leading to empty shelves and racks (and the sacking of fashion boss Jill McDonald). Today, CEO Steve Rowe has insisted it is seeing “a positive response” from shoppers, and suggested clothing sales are turning around.Here’s the full story:To Masayoshi Son’s credit, he isn’t ducking the WeWork issue.Speaking to journalists in Tokyo, SoftBank’s CEO admits that he blundered by pumping so much money into the office rental company, which had to be bailed out last month.“The perception is that SoftBank is being dragged down into the quagmire of WeWork.”“I am looking back with true regret about the mistaken investment moves that I have made.”But Son also insisted that WeWork, which leases offices and desk space, can have a bright future.Associated Press has the details:In a presentation, Son said WeWork was losing money from initial construction and design costs but, with time, property will become profitable.A reporter asked how WeWork was an internet company when it was real estate, a question that has been on many minds on WeWork. But Son said internet technology is incorporated into WeWork’s concept. WeWork focuses on offering office space to startups.Son also argued that it’s common for new companies to start out with losses, including those considered successes such as Amazon and Facebook, and they were able to eventually grow.SoftBank has said it has ample cash to handle the WeWork woes. “There is no storm, and things are under control,” he said, although he smiled when the crowd responded with giggles.Today’s huuuge loss is actually SoftBank’s first quarterly loss in 14 years.It’s a day of reckoning for SoftBank, as Bloomberg puts it:Masayoshi Son is finally disclosing the damage from SoftBank Group Corp.’s bets on WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc.The Japanese investment powerhouse on Wednesday reported its first quarterly operating loss in 14 years -- about $6.5 billion --after writing down the value of a string of marquee investments. It swallowed a charge of 497.7 billion yen ($4.6 billion) for WeWork, whose spectacular implosion turned the once high-flying shared-office startup into a Silicon Valley punchline.SoftBank Group, the Japanese tech investor, has slumped to a massive quarterly loss after the valuations of US companies WeWork and Uber plunged, my colleague Jasper Jolly writes.The company, run by billionaire investor Masayoshi Son, made an operating loss of 704bn yen (£5bn) in the three months to the end of September, in results published on Wednesday.The loss comes after a dreadful quarter for the tech companies backed by Son’s venture capital funds, the $100bn Vision Fund and the smaller Delta Fund.SoftBank’s operating loss was due to the “decrease in the fair values of investments including Uber and WeWork and its three affiliates” held by SoftBank’s Vision Fund and Delta Fund, it said. The two funds together made a quarterly loss of 970bn yen.Son acknowledged his judgement around the $10.3bn investment in WeWork was not right, and admitted his faith in WeWork founder Adam Neumann was misplaced, in a presentation to investors on Wednesday.Son said he turned a blind eye to Neumann’s bad side over issues such as corporate governance and that he had learned a harsh lesson, according to Reuters. He added that WeWork was not a sinking boat, despite a need to cut spending.WeWork’s parent, the We Company, was forced to abandon an initial public offering of its shares on US stock markets at the end of September after investors queried the massive valuation given to the office space rental company. SoftBank then led a $9.5bn bailout of WeWork, and founder Adam Neumann was forced out. The debacle wiped $7.8bn from WeWork’s valuation, SoftBank said.Shares in Uber, which listed in May, fell to a new record low on Tuesday as it posted yet another loss, despite beating revenues estimates. Some investors in its stock market float will on Wednesday be able to sell their shares for the first time, when a lock-up period expires.Son’s net worth has plunged by about $6bn since July, when it peaked at about $20bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which tracks billionaires’ wealth. That left Son with $13.8bn on Tuesday.The difficult quarter could complicate Son’s efforts to raise a second Vision fund if investors question his high-risk strategy of making significant bets on big-spending, young companies. Preparations for a “full-scale launch” are still underway, SoftBank said.Economists are hailing today’s rise in German factory orders.Viraj Patel, strategist at Arkera, says it’s an encouraging sign for the eurozone economy.Bloomberg’s Yuko Takeo says Germany’s factory sector is showing welcome signs of life:A rebound in German factory orders is adding to signs that the euro-area economy has passed the worst of its recent troubles.The euro rose after the report and traded at $1.1076 at 8:54 a.m. Frankfurt time.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Is Germany turning a corner? After many months of gloom, Europe’s largest economy may finally be bottoming out.The pick-up in demand was driven by orders within Germany, and from countries outside the eurozone.Destatis, the statistics body, explains:Encouragingly, orders for expensive, heavy-duty machinery and equipment rose strongly.This may not prevent Germany falling into recession, but it does offer hope that growth could pick up again soon.Over in Japan, technology investor Softbank has just posted a whopping operating loss of ¥700bn for the last quarter (almost £5bn), due to disappointing bets on companies such as WeWork and Uber.That’s a stark reversal on the ¥706bn profit in July-September 2018, and much worse than the ¥48bn loss which analysts expected. SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son is presenting the report now, and admitting that “we are in a rough sea”... The latest surveys of eurozone purchasing managers are expected to show that Europe’s services sector continued to grow last month. But with manufacturing shrinking, the euro economy remains subdued.After a few days of gains, stocks are dipping today.

He is seeking his first national mandate as prime minister, so doesn’t see himself as a shop-soiled candidate. But he is asking voters to return his party to office for a third time, and it wasn’t much loved to begin with.Labour has the opposite problem. There is plenty of hunger for a new direction in government, but the appetite is dulled by the sight of Jeremy Corbyn asking to be prime minister. It is risky to serve a dish that the electorate has sent back to the kitchen once already.Both of the biggest parties are trying to sell messages of renewal with messengers who are familiar and unpopular. Polls give the Tories a head start, but there is wind behind the opposition in a campaign when even the government admits it is time for a change.Johnson’s claim to be the candidate for a fresh start is contained tenuously in his promise of a swift end to the Brexit saga. He would implement his deal and a burden would thus be lifted from the nation’s shoulders. The prime minister argues that Labour’s policy is to avoid having a policy, deferring the choice, prolonging the pain, which is true enough. The brighter the spotlight on Corbyn’s fence-sitting, the wobblier Labour look.But Johnson has a tricky job selling his plan while also trying to insulate it from scrutiny. He wants people to know there is a deal, but not to care what is in it. There is a flaw in the strategy that makes Brexit the central issue, while running on a platform that appeals to public weariness with the topic. That problem feeds back into the incumbency issue. There is something dissonant in a campaign that says vote for me so we can end this nightmare that I told you would be brilliant vote for the Tories to move on from the only thing Tories seem to care about. Hardline Conservative Eurosceptics have so much pent-up revolutionary frustration, they think they haven’t even started yet. That blinds them to the possibility that the public are tired of having them around.A six-week campaign is long enough for those contradictions to show, especially with Nigel Farage flapping around drawing attention to them. His claim that Johnson’s deal does not effect a clean enough break is ridiculous – it is a severe separation – but the Brexit party had nowhere to go but harder still. And its target audience has been groomed by Tory radicals to feel betrayed by anything that postpones the gratifying instant of rupture. Already Johnson is being tested on post-Brexit transitional arrangements. He says they won’t have to be extended beyond December 2020.They will. A free-trade agreement with Brussels cannot be negotiated by the end of next year. The going rate is more like five years. Under Johnson’s plan, a miserably familiar landscape sweeps into view: Brexiteers pretending something impossible is easy, ruling out compromise and denouncing as traitors any who counsel delay. Meet the new rows over Europe, same as the old ones.The Liberal Democrats have correctly identified article 50 revocation as the efficient way to settle the technical question of Britain’s future relationship with the EU, but it is not something any government likely to be formed after this election could reasonably do, as Jo Swinson must know. The politics of aborting Brexit are as gruesome as the economics of going through with it. There is no good outcome now, only different routes to realising that it was a stupid idea in the first place.With a sustained display of incompetence, cowardice, delusion and ideological mania, British politics has created a situation so monstrous and writhing with venom that the public cannot bear to look at it. Brexit is like the mythical Gorgon that turns to stone all who meet its gaze. It must instead be stalked indirectly, using the monster’s reflection in their polished shield.That is why the election will be only obliquely about Brexit. It will not feature rational evaluation of Britain’s relationship with the rest of Europe. These campaigns never do. The referendum drove big red and blue buses down every social fault line in the country without arriving at a functional definition of Brexit. The 2017 election was more animated by fox-hunting and dementia care than customs unions and regulatory alignment. Even when politics appears to be about Brexit, it conspires to be about something else: jostling for position in a Tory leadership race pro-remain guerrilla manoeuvres in the remote hills of Commons procedure.With parliament dissolved, anything relating to the substance of negotiation in Brussels will fall off the agenda because it is a boring subject for most voters and always has been. Meanwhile, neither of the two candidates to be prime minister is going to offer an honest appraisal of why leaving has been so difficult and why it brings no material benefit to the country.There will be ample talk of something called Brexit, but that word will continue to be a proxy for grievances only tangentially connected to EU membership. Or it will be a tint on the lens through which other issues – the NHS, crime, education – will be projected. If British politics was capable of sustaining a focus on the banal reality of continental integration it would have happened by now. And of all the climates in which to cultivate measured debate on the subject, a frenzied, polarised election campaign is the least hospitable. We will get to the end of it and, whatever the result, the monstrous tangle of ugly Brexit choices will still be there. The Gorgon will not be slain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f677d42c059848433f6801a3a15b5b51881ea11/0_122_5778_3467/master/5778.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbc569d87b20d1b13916aecae6b27670","title":"michael gove tweets election","story":"One thing that separates 90s kids (me) from the shallow and terrifying TikTok generation, who know how the wifi works on their iPad without having to Google it on their phone first (anyone born this millennium), is that they don’t have the same inbuilt expectation that America is always exactly one season ahead of where we are.Take Friends, for instance. Americans, with their two-litre cans of soda and lurid neon corn snacks, knew about Joey and Rachel kissing months before we knew about Joey and Rachel kissing they went through the boom-and-bust cycle of loving then hating the Ross’s pet monkey storyline a full half-year before we did. And it wasn’t just TV: they were ahead on trends and fashions, and cool phrases and new kinds of inline skates and limited edition Pogs. America, we thought, was the future and Britain, we figured, was the slow-moving past.This has changed. Thanks to streaming and always-on digital culture and slickly maintained piracy websites and 24-hour news and Twitter, we know things at the same time that America knows things, we watch things concurrently with them, and we all got disappointed by the Game of Thrones finale at the exact same time. Where America once trendsat, we now straddle alongside, tucked up in the nook between the neck and the shoulder, nuzzling in.So now we’ve caught up it’s high time for our first yee-haw, hometown-style America-inflected election, and by that I mean we are ripe for a too-online campaign dominated by brief flashes of trending topics, banana-skin troll accounts slipping up previously unknown elected officials, probably some accusations of Russian interference – and, most importantly, outlandishly brash lies being tweeted out in earnest then rigorously fact-checked in seconds by dedicated teams of reply guys. And, obviously, Michael Gove was first to kick things off.If you don’t spend the several hours of last weekend looking at Michael Gove’s Twitter account, I’ll catch you up: on Sunday night Gove got drawn in by what looked, smelled and tasted a lot like a troll account claiming to be a Momentum member (100 or so followers, inexplicable string of random numbers in the account name, Palestine flag emoji, display name that didn’t quite match the actual name, that sort of thing) that was blasting out antisemitism under a #JC4PM hashtag, using the name “Joe Woods”. Gove saw the tweet and called out leading members of the vocal left, imploring them to root out antisemitism in their party and using the Joe Woods account as an exemplar. They all pointed out that Joe Woods almost certainly didn’t exist Momentum itself confirmed Joe Woods didn’t have a membership. Gove doubled down once, then doubled down again somehow and demanded they solve antisemitism by, ironically, quote-tweeting antisemitism and blasting it out to the 133,000 or so followers he has on Twitter. Can someone stop this antisemitism I keep spreading, please? Would be really good if that could get that looked at cheers.Debacles like this are bad (obviously) but good (bear with me) for setting the overall tone of the election to come, which I think we all admit, much like a New Years’ Eve party, needs a theme to really get going. Previous elections have had themes, or at least an rough idea: Brexit for the last one, debates for the one before that, tuition fees and bigoted women before that, \u0026ampc, \u0026ampc, \u0026ampc. The theme for the big bad election of 2019 is, at this early stage, leaning towards “theatrical misinformation”, and a lot of that is to do with how the internet has turned into a beautiful precision tool to make high-profile figures embarrass themselves by not really knowing how to use it – but persistently using it anyway.Gove isn’t the first one to get suckered in, at a point, I must remind you, that is barely a week into the election cycle.The Change UK MP Mike Gapes, a man with the defeated air of a coach driver having his keys tossed round by laughing teenagers at a motorway service station, somehow got conned into endorsing a mock tactical voting website that recommended voting for Mike Gapes in every constituency.Meanwhile – and I barely know how to explain this – the BBC politics live editor Rob Burley and many of his too-online blue-tick friends got suckered in by an #FBPE parody account that accused him of manufacturing an audience plant on Question Time which included cutting a young Tory fox hunter’s hair “to make him look like a regular working-class youngster” – a claim so bizarre and amazing it was bound to go viral. The fallout was predictable: Burley firmly asserting that he didn’t work on Question Time suggestions that he take legal action against the parody account some legitimate hand-wringing from ultra-ironic leftwing shitposters about the fine grey line between wilful misinformation, lighthearted joking that becomes serious the second someone falls for it, and the constant need to be sincere in case we get carried away and accidentally vote for Brexit. When it’s day two of an election and BBC staff are already having to deny forcibly giving haircuts, you know we’re in for a good one.This was a tone-setting week in leading figures falling for things online, and frankly a banner one, too. Thought it was bad when we were all getting tricked by that big red bus, didn’t we? But three years later, and somehow everything is worse. There will be – and mark my words as if I were a witch on a moor making a blood promise that you will be king – mark my words: there will be much, much, much more of this to come.A running theme in The Discourse so far is the classic “should 16-year-olds be allowed to vote YN?” – which seems more pertinent then ever, when such a vast swath of the Brexit voting public has conspired to die of old age before it even got delivered. It’s the same back and forth as ever, really: on one side, people pointing out that 16-year-olds can marry, work, leave home and join the army, so why not vote on the other hand, furious parents pointing out that their son is still asleep at 2pm, that’s why. I don’t personally think that drinking a Red Bull for breakfast and having an Xbox Gold account should preclude anyone from voting, but I am enjoying parents very literally selling their own children out as idiots for Twitter clout, so it’s hard to say really which side is good or bad.• Joel Golby is the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant.

Not enough is being done to protect academic freedom from financial, political and diplomatic pressure.”The committee highlighted the role of China-funded Confucius Institutes officials in confiscating papers that mentioned Taiwan at an academic conference, the use of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association as an instrument of political interference and evidence that dissidents active while studying in the UK, such as Ayeshagul Nur Ibrahim, an Uighur Muslim, were being monitoring and her family in China being harassed.The committee accuses some academic organisations, such as Million Plus, which represents 20 modern universities, of complacency.Bill Rammell, the chair of Million Plus, told the committee he had “not heard one piece of evidence” that substantiated claims of foreign influence in universities.The committee said the government’s focus was on protecting universities from intellectual property theft and risks arising from joint research projects. “This is not enough to protect academic freedom from other types of interference such as financial, political or diplomatic pressure,” the MPs said.The Foreign Office’s evidence to the committee highlighted the lack of government advice to universities, the report says, adding ministers have not coordinated approaches to the issue, either within Whitehall or with foreign governments such as Australia and the US.The report points out that a 2019 international education strategy white paper mentions China more than 20 times in the context of boosting education expertise to the Chinese market, but with no mention of security or interference.The committee concluded: “The battle for university students or trade deals should not outweigh the international standards which have brought freedom and prosperity to the UK and the wider world. The government should provide any strategic advice to universities and not used its key sanction tools such as ‘Magnitsky powers’ to curb interference on human rights grounds.”Ministers can curb interference through the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act passed 17 months ago, the report said.However, ministers previously told the committee they could not use the so-called Magnitsky amendment, contained in the act, until the UK had left the EU. In June the FCO finally admitted this interpretation was legally incorrect, and the powers could be used independently of the EU while still an EU member.The FCO has still to lay the necessary statutory instrument to introduce the power, 17 months after the act became law. The foreign affairs select committee pointed out that the power, touted by the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, in pre-Conservative party conference interviews, will be delayed still further by the general election.The committee, chaired by the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, also asked the FCO to explain its failure to use sanctions in response to repression by state authorities in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.On the question of Hong Kong, where violent protests continue and local elections are due to be held later this month, the committee has urged the government to assess the reputational damage to the UK of British judges continuing to sit on the Hong Kong court of final appeal. The committee warns there is a danger of the UK appearing to be complicit in supporting and participating in a system that is undermining the rule of law.In a bid to support the protesters, the UK should grant residency to Hong Kong citizens who are British national (overseas) passport holders, the report said.Tugendhat said hard-won freedoms were under threat in the UK. The FCO had been “found wanting in three policy areas: autocracies’ influence on academic freedom the use of sanctions against autocratic states and their supporters, and the UK’s cooperation with other democracies in responding to autocracies”.An FCO spokesperson said: “The UK is a passionate defender of democracy and the rules-based international system, showing leadership on issues from climate change to media freedom. When we leave the EU, we will set our own sanctions regime and hold to account those who commit serious abuses of human rights.“We will look at this report closely as we continue to bolster our efforts to promote and uphold our democratic values.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e92de7c7ca26686954530ead84058f3a55773b28/171_0_5135_3081/master/5135.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa821d27b46a47efc308f0dfcba41d5f","title":"have you been invited to take part in the uk citizens climate assembly","story":"We want to hear from some of the 30,000 who have received an invitation from MPs to join the climate emergency discussionFrom Wednesday, 30,000 people will begin to receive invitations to take part in a citizens’ assembly on the climate emergency convened by MPs.A demographically representative sample of the population will then be selected from those who respond, with 110 people taking part in the Climate Assembly UK over four weekends in Birmingham next year.Participants will be asked to discuss how the UK should respond to the climate emergency and what policies they would like to see implemented to meet the target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, now enshrined in law.We want to hear from people who have received an invitation to take part about their views on participating.We are interested in hearing from people who have received an invitation to take part in Climate Assembly UK.Are you pleased?

I’m always attracted to unconventional designers and I like clothes that have fun with gender norms – because it is something to mock, to laugh at. I was drawn to it because I thought it made me look like a monk – I was like, just call me black Rasputin.There’s no way I could wear a dress like this in Jamaica. For the most part, I dress like I’m a Jamaican from the 70s when I’m there: really colourful polyester shirts, formal pants, sneakers, and I might wear a tam, which is the headgear Rastafarians wear to keep the dreadlocks in. It’s funny because I show up there and people are like: “Wow, you’re dressing wild,” and I’m like: “Are you serious? I’m kind of dressing conservative!” When I go there, I say I’m back in my “butch drag”.As I have become comfortable in my own identity and my own body, I have also become comfortable expressing that freedom with different kinds of clothes. Don’t get me wrong, I probably have more suits than anybody but having the freedom to wear a dress is something I’ve picked up as I’ve got older. I also wear a lot of long shirts from Japanese designers.My style icons are Grace Jones, André 3000, Prince – but early Prince – and any member of The Clash.

Italian fashion house Gucci announced it would go fur-free in 2017 and auction off all its remaining animal fur items. In 2018, London fashion week became the first of the big fashion events to commit to banning fur. When Prada announced it would stop using fur in its collections in May, activists hoped the move would reignite a campaign that had taken its foot off the pedal. Most recently, Macy’s announced it would stop selling fur items by February 2021, making it the biggest US retailer to do so, and last month California became the first US state to ban animal fur products.Claire Bass, executive director of the Humane Society International, called the Queen’s decision to “go faux” from now on “the perfect reflection of the mood of the British public, the vast majority of whom detest cruel fur, and want nothing to do with it”.Her Majesty is no stranger to fur – she wore leopard-skin stoles in the 1950s and attended the opera draped in fur in the 40s.Peta used the news to call on the Queen to rethink the fur worn by members of the Queen’s Guard and “complete the policy by ordering that the fur be replaced by the humane, luxurious faux bearskin that Peta has helped develop alongside faux-furrier Ecopel and designer Stella McCartney”. The Humane Society International called on the government to make the UK the first country in the world to ban the sale of fur.Kelly’s book has also brought to light claims that the royal dresser wears in the Queen’s shoes before engagements, “to ensure they are comfortable and that she is always good to go” that the Queen requested to say the line “Good evening, Mr Bond” when she appeared alongside Daniel Craig during the Olympics opening ceremony in 2012, and that she was very happy to share a hug  with Michelle Obama."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bab0562fbbf54af23ae20f494e26f12fe1ad988/0_326_3409_2046/master/3409.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0c4c152106e3ecea333578a155684b5","title":"liverpool genk champions league match report","story":"This victory over Genk will not rank among the most exhilarating European nights of Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool career but it will be savoured regardless. The Champions League holders are within touching distance of the knockout stages again and will appreciate every opportunity to finish the job early given the workload ahead.Liverpool moved top of the group courtesy of another fine goal against Genk from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, his fourth in four games, and Napoli’s failure to beat Salzburg. They can secure progress with a game to spare by beating Carlo Ancelotti’s side at Anfield later this month.That may be easier said than done but, having gone 24 European home games unbeaten, Klopp’s team will have the confidence and, given their December fixture list, the incentive to tick off another priority for the season before travelling to Salzburg for the final group game.This was a mundane contest and routine victory, delivered by Georginio Wijnaldum’s early improvised finish and Oxlade-Chamberlain’s second-half winner. The Belgium champions retained hope of securing a draw until the end owing to Liverpool’s inability to kill off the game. Alisson’s important save from Bryan Heynen nine minutes from time ensured they did not.Mundane was just fine for Klopp. Winning with a much changed team, with key players rested and without any injuries before Manchester City’s hugely significant visit in the Premier League on Sunday, was, as he put it, job done.The Liverpool manager, who deployed Oxlade-Chamberlain in the Roberto Firmino role between Mohamed Salah and Divock Origi, said: “It was clear it would be a bit tricky in some departments because the front three never played together in these positions or in a formation like this. We wanted to have Ox between the lines, give him the space to turn and run at the last line with options right and left. That worked pretty well sometimes and we could have scored more often.“The longer the game goes, the more the momentum goes to the other team if you don’t finish your situations off. ‘Job done’ is the headline for the game, pretty much, but the group is not decided. It’s a tough group. We are first in the table but we want to be first after the last match day and now we have to play two tough games, and two important ones.”Liverpool’s task and the spectacle were complicated by the more conservative approach that Genk adopted compared with their 4-1 defeat when the teams met in Belgium two weeks ago. Felice Mazzu’s side suffered their fifth domestic defeat of the season at lowly Eupen at the weekend. That reverse, coupled with a punishing start to their European campaign, prompted a five-man defence at Anfield as the Genk manager sought to restore confidence and solidity in his ranks.“We took a risk by coming here to play the best team in the world with a new system and without having time to work on it on the pitch, so I am very proud of the players,” Mazzu said.Liverpool prospered down Genk’s right flank in the first half with James Milner almost as potent creatively as the man he replaced at left-back, Andy Robertson. Origi, who started his career at Genk, was involved in the breakthrough when he released Milner down the left. There was an appeal for offside but the veteran had timed his run to perfection. A low cross driven across the goalmouth struck Carlos Cuesta and his fellow defender Sébastian Dewaest before dropping into the run of Wijnaldum, who hooked the ball into the roof of the net from close range.The European champions maintained the pressure and dominance of possession but lacked the clinical touch to put the game beyond Genk. Gaëtan Coucke saved well with his legs from Naby Keïta after a surging run by Oxlade-Chamberlain gave the midfielder a clear shot. Both Salah and Origi dragged decent opportunities wide of Coucke’s left-hand post when free inside the box.Genk had offered nothing as an attacking threat for the opening 40 minutes. Almost inevitably they equalised from their first meaningful attack. Trent Alexander-Arnold showed good awareness to prevent Ally Mbwana Samatta connecting with an inviting cross from Joakim Maehle by flicking the ball out for a corner. From the resulting delivery by Heynen, Samatta expertly timed his run between Oxlade-Chamberlain and Milner to send a thumping header past Alisson at the near post.Genk’s belief soared but, as in Belgium, they were tormented by Oxlade-Chamberlain when he was found inside the area by Salah’s intelligent lay-off. The England international shaped to turn with his back to goal, Maehle bought it and looked on aghast as the midfielder used the space he had created for himself to drive a low finish beyond Coucke.

The score was 1-1 in each match and Liverpool went on to win on both occasions.Jürgen Klopp had forcibly disagreed with Guardiola’s view and he has been forced into a climbdown.“In the 94th minute it was against Leicester, it was a penalty and it was wow,” Guardiola said. “That was the intention for my comment. Far away from my intention to say Sadio is this type of player because I admire him a lot.“For Jürgen it is a penalty, for the referee it was a penalty, for VAR it was a penalty, so I was the wrong guy,” he added.“Jürgen said he knows Sadio better than me. And I have an incredible respect and the message in the football always try to be like this, always positive and attractive. My son and my daughter, when they win in the last minutes, they ask me how lucky they are. I say it’s not lucky.“What Liverpool have done last season and this season many times is because they have this incredible quality and this incredible talent to fight until the end. Hopefully I can clarify everything for Jürgen.Klopp also suggested Guardiola is fixated with Liverpool. “I didn’t listen to what he said, so I don’t know,” he said.Guardiola attempted to close down Klopp’s claim regarding City and tactical fouls, a view also held by Ole Gunnar Solskjær, his predecessor as the Manchester United manager, José Mourinho, and the West Ham manager, Manuel Pellegrini. “No comment on that. I don’t put oil in the fire,” he said.If City beat Atalanta at San Siro on Wednesday they are guaranteed passage to the Champions League knockout stages. “I’m wanting to qualify as soon as possible,” Guardiola said. “I’m not thinking of rotating my squad. I go game by game, try to win tomorrow, then we are already there for one more year.“But if not we have Shakhtar Donetsk and Dinamo Zagreb still to play and we will see then. Wednesday is the most important to try to win and after go on to the next one.”John Stones is in line to make a first start in the competition, his season having been hampered by injury. “It’s been difficult getting injured,” the centre-back said. It was difficult not being able to be there for the team and manager, trying to stay as fit and healthy as I can, trying to get a run of games when called on.“Now I feel good, feel fit and that’s the main thing. I need to stay like this for the rest of the season.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95d4f54ec26ce07113bf54b22b4c3409a12de84b/545_45_3130_1878/master/3130.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c83c43d9b0880fcd9bb5dc97fc6c14f8","title":"frank lampard hails chelsea spirit comeback ajax","story":"• Chelsea were 4-1 down before drawing 4-4• Lampard: ‘The players really pushed tonight and I loved it’Frank Lampard praised Chelsea’s spirit after they fought back from 4-1 down to claim a point against Ajax and keep their hopes of reaching the last 16 of the Champions League alive on a dramatic night at Stamford Bridge.Chelsea were outplayed for long spells by the Dutch champions and were on their way to an embarrassing home defeat midway through the second half. Ajax had taken a commanding lead thanks to strikes from Hakim Ziyech and Donny van de Beek and own-goals from Kepa Arrizabalaga and Tammy Abraham.Yet César Azpilicueta reduced the deficit and Ajax unravelled, losing both of their centre-backs, Daley Blind and Joël Veltman, to red cards in the move that allowed Jorginho to score his second penalty of the night.Down to nine men, Erik ten Hag’s side cracked when Reece James, Chelsea’s 19-year-old right-back, equalised and they were relieved when Azpilicueta had a potential winner ruled out after VAR spotted a handball by Tammy Abraham.“For a performance like today you need characters and personalities,” Lampard said. “At 3-1 down at half-time, it’s easy to turn it in. Even easier at 4-1. But we never did. I keep saying it about the experienced players. Those players really pushed tonight and I loved it.”There was a mixture of relief and deflation for Lampard at the end. The draw keeps Chelsea level on points with Ajax and Valencia with two games left. Valencia, who thrashed Lille 4-1 in the group’s other game, host Lampard’s side later this month.“I always felt this group was going to be tight,” Chelsea’s manager said. “I felt teams could take points off each other. We’re in it but we certainly have work to do. We need to go to Valencia and Lille come here. Both of those are very tough matches. I felt today we could have won the game and that’s with respect to Ajax because they are a top team. The performances in Lille and at Ajax should give us confidence. Valencia have had a great result tonight and that will give them confidence that they can go through.”Lampard, who lost Mason Mount to an ankle injury during the second half, was impressed with James after he brought the youngster on at half-time. “Reece is a fantastic young player and he gives what you saw,” he said. “He is going to be a great player for this club.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42b2d9aae4fef4272e4b44aac7d99f73f349bfdf/0_173_4290_2574/master/4290.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1a603598092306d6181ed640887ca36","title":"boats burgers and whale bones cambridge for kids","story":"From playgrounds to punts, mazes to museums, animals to afternoon tea, Cambridge is packed with kid-happy things to see, do and eat. Get insider’s advice from local Oisín Higney, seven (with the help of brother Milo, 17, and mum Kate) Cambridge is brilliant and my Granny Eva lives there too. It has a river and loads of museums and parks. It is fun to travel there by train. I’d like to be a train driver when I grow up, or maybe a pilot. Last time, we shared our seats with another family and I got to watch Paw Patrol on another boy’s iPad. So I made a new friend, which was awesome. Do you want to know what I like to do in Cambridge?Cambridge University Botanic Garden is very near the station and is great to run around. It has a fountain, a mini-maze and stepping stones over a little lake. I think that the tall yellow grass plants look like fur. I like to hide behind the trees. You can’t climb them as it might hurt the branches. I like to make up games in the rock garden instead. The greenhouse is not green but it is hot and made of glass. Go to see the big cactuses and pretend you are a cowboy. They have very prickly spines so watch out. Also, there is a lily pad big enough for a frog the size of me.From here you can walk into town by following the river. You go over lots of bridges. If you want you can play in the Lammas Land playground. In summer, there are brown cows in Coe Fen and Midsummer Common. Real cows, you say, in the middle of Cambridge? Yes there are, and it’s kind of cool.At the Mill Pond, by the Mathematical Bridge, there are lots of people on small boats called punts. An adult has to stand up with a long pole. It looks like they are fishing but really they are pushing the boats along. We went on a punt and ate strawberries. The man who pushed us was really good at ducking down under the bridges and not falling off. You can even go at night on a Bat Punt Safari. Spooky!Do you like skateparks, tennis or playgrounds? Jesus Green has them all, right next to the river. Sometimes we go to the family runs on Sunday morning in Milton Country Park. I can run really fast. The Science Centre has a cool marble run, and the Centre for Computing History has a lot of retro games that my dad knows all about.There are lots of buildings that look like castles in the middle of Cambridge. King’s College looks like a church castle and Trinity College is where a man called Newton went. He had an apple fall on his head, and then he invented gravity, which is very cool. Did you know that there is a banana tree in Cambridge? It’s in Pembroke College. See if you can find the big Corpus Clock made of real gold. I think it is funny as it doesn’t even tell the time. It has a mechanical insect on the top, and if you wait for ages, his eye blinks. If you like climbing high you can see the whole of Cambridge from Great St Mary’s Church Steeple. Just don’t get stuck next to the bell when it rings! It can be fun to to explore the small streets in the centre, you could even do a treasure trail. If I get tired of walking, we go into Heffers, Waterstones or the Central Library and look at children’s books.Did I say that there were loads of museums? Just on Downing Street there are three, like the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences. Find the bronze statue of Mr Sedgwick. He is holding a hammer and a trilobite shell that is 500m years old, which is older than my mum. My favourite is the huge fin whale at the Museum of Zoology. It hangs on the ceiling and it’s ginormous. You can look up and see all its bones and teeth. I also like the stuffed animals, games, and big screen with tiny square TVs of different creatures. My brother says we have to look after animals or they just get extinct. There is a museum that also looks like a castle. It is the Fitzwilliam and when you get in the ceiling is really high. You have got to see the Egyptian mummies, the knight’s armour and the swords – they are awesome. If you like real animals, then the red pandas in Shepreth Wildlife Park are really cute. It is right next to Shepreth train station, just a few minutes outside Cambridge.Aromi has tasty Sicilian margherita pizza that you eat from a wooden plate. I love the dark chocolate ice-cream. My brother likes Bill’s restaurant, as he says it has delicious buttermilk pancakes with bacon and the staff are really friendly. They are only served at brunch so you must be early. He also likes the spicy chicken rolls in Pho (Vietnamese). La Margherita has nice pasta, and is near Kettles Yard Art Gallery. The MillWorks has a real gigantic wheel in the middle and is right next to the river. My favourite is a plain burger and fries at Byron Burger or Honest Burger, but it has to have ketchup. If you want some treats for the train home, there are Chelsea buns in Fitzbillies. On Mill Road, near the station, you can get nice cakes in the Urban Larder or Norfolk Street Bakery. And if you want an apple to fall on your head and have a big idea, you can go to the Orchard Tea Garden in Grantchester for strawberry jam scones and sit under the trees in a deckchair.Take a trip to Cambridge.

So if you want the inside scoop on family fun? Talk to an under-10, of course. Six-year-old Londoner Indy Williams – with help from mum Kate Faithfull-Williams – shares her favourite city spotsI love London because it’s an exciting place to live and it has lots of landmarks. London can get very busy because lots of people want to come here. You might not know this but it’s great being a little kid in a big city because there’s lots to do and it’s easy to get about. It’s fastest to go on the train because then you don’t get stuck in traffic. I like to do crossword puzzles waiting at the station and to wave at the driver. All aboard? Off we go …Start right in the middle of London – literally, because Blackfriars station is on the river. It’s right next to a big art museum called Tate Modern. There are cool exhibitions with light-up kaleidoscopes and swings. Outside, look for the performers by the river who blow massive bubbles so big you can jump inside. Watch out for the statues. They are not real statues, but people dressed up in gold.Walk past Shakespeare’s Globe theatre and on to Borough Market where you can eat any sort of food you fancy. Maybe sausages or a big lunch like paella and the most ginormous fudgy chocolate brownie. Look out for the new Thames virtual reality experience by One London Bridge. It’s like a big pair of goggles that lets you see all the wildlife in the Thames, like seahorses, seals and even dolphins and sharks.You have to go to Tower Bridge because at the top there’s a glass walkway. It looks like you’re standing on air. Me and my mum and little sister lay down on the glass and it was super duper scary but really exciting. It feels like you’re flying above the buses and boats below. The road rises up to let tall ships in and out of London. From the top you can see an old warship called HMS Belfast, the jungle at the Sky Garden, lots of skyscrapers like the Shard, and the Tower of London.The Tower of London is a real palace where the Crown Jewels live. They look delicious, but they’re rocks not sweets and you’re not allowed to lick them. The crown has a sparkly disco ball on top, which is cool. You can go on a tour and meet the ravens and look at the king’s armour. It’s silly there isn’t any armour for queens. Why isn’t there any? If I was the Queen I’d want my own armour.The train takes you right past the Shard and St Paul’s Cathedral to Greenwich. Climb aboard the big ship from long, long ago called the Cutty Sark. You can run up and down on the deck but you’re not allowed to jump off the railings. You’re not allowed to jump on the little bunk beds either, but it’s fun to play in the captain’s cabin. The ship isn’t in the water. It’s in a big hall with a cafe where you can get a kids’ lunchbox or a fancy afternoon tea with lots of little cakes.Don’t bother with the meridian line. It’s not time travel like I thought it would be. It’s just a line with lots of people queuing up to take boring photos. But you might like the space exhibition at the planetarium in the Royal Observatory. You can fly to the sun or land on Mars and see what a star looks like when it is born.The National Maritime Museum is my favourite because it’s got a big kids’ zone. You can climb the rigging, fix old boats, dress up like a pirate, catch pretend lobsters and sell them in the crab shop. Upstairs by the cafe there’s a giant map you can run all over. You can stand on your country and run across the ocean. Russia is very big. England is teeny weeny. In the grownup part of the museum there is Lord Nelson’s jacket with a bullet hole in the shoulder, paintings by Turner, who I’m learning about in school, and figureheads from old boats, which I used to be scared of. My mum got me a little baby turtle (not a real one) in the gift shop. She’s called Turtle.On Sunday morning come to Junior Parkrun in Wimbledon Park. It’s free but you have to register. I run 2km with my friends Josie, Alex and Emily. Sometimes I walk. After Parkrun you can get peanut butter ice-cream or strawberry sorbet in the park cafe. Sometimes the sprinklers are on if you want to cool down. Wimbledon Park has everything: a big lake where kids can sail their own boats, an obstacle course, two playgrounds (for babies and older children), mini golf and beach volleyball. I prefer playing sports to watching them so I haven’t been to the famous tennis court in Wimbledon but my nana and grampy have been to the museum there and they ate a lot of strawberries. They didn’t bring any home for me.The best lunch is in Wimbledon Village, which looks like the country but it is in London. Everybody will like a margherita at the pizza van.

The orange juice at Megan’s on the High Street is the most delicious drink I’ve ever had.Before you get on the train home, walk up to Wimbledon Common where you can make dens out of big sticks and leaves. It is a good idea to wear wellies. There’s lots of colourful flowers and wildlife, like birds and squirrels and dogs.

Say hello to Worthing: the lesser-known beachside beauty with bucket-and-spades-full of family fun. Lola Davies, aged 13 (with a little help from mum Tracey), gives us the inside scoop on family time in her favourite seaside spot by Lola and Tracey DaviesI’m going to call this guide “The Importance of Being Worthing”, because my English teacher says that Oscar Wilde spent a summer here in 1894 – and wrote The Importance of Being Earnest in Worthing.Only a 25-minute train ride from where I live in Brighton, Worthing’s where we come when Brighton gets a bit too busy. It’s a traditional Georgian seaside resort, with an art deco pier (which won Pier of the Year 2019), old-fashioned amusements and ice-cream parlours, a new big wheel and a lovely, long pebbly beach.When the sun shines ...It’s easy for us to get to Worthing from Brighton, but Londoners can get there easily too – the direct train from London Victoria only takes 90 minutes. This year, the Worthing Observation Wheel opened. At 46 metres high, it’s the tallest observation wheel on the south coast, and is open from April to October. While you can’t quite see my house from the top, it has amazing views all along the coast and across the South Downs national park.If you don’t fancy swimming in the sea then go to Splashpoint, a fun leisure centre with slides and a ing pool that is close to the beach.For smaller kids, say eight and under, I recommend The Worthing Lido, a small amusement park with rides like the spinning teacups and the Disney Express train. My brother, sister and I always like playing on the 2p slot machines in the arcade.Is Worthing worth it on a rainy day?We don’t just come to Worthing when it’s sunny. Sometimes I like it more when it’s not, as it means we can go to the Dome Cinema on the seafront. It was called The Kursaal when it opened in 1911 and had a rollerskating rink on the ground floor and a cinema on the top floor. It’s a shame it doesn’t have the rollerskating rink any more, but I like watching films in the old-fashioned auditorium with vintage seats. My mum says it was in the movie Wish You Were Here, which was filmed in Worthing, and there’s lots of old cinema memorabilia in the Projectionist’s Bar.On the way down to the beach, we pass Harold Pinter’s old house, and pop in to the Worthing Museum and Art Gallery. It’s free to enter and has loads of cool stuff, like piles of Roman coins and tools found nearby at Cissbury Ring, an iron age fort. I like the 19th- and 20th-century clothes they have on display – Mum always swoons over the sparkly Chanel dress from the 1930s. But my favourite bit is the cabinet of swimming costumes throughout the years. I think it’s crazy that people back then used to wear knitted bathers!Getting hungry?While I’m happy with candy floss and ice-cream, the folks insist on having something more substantial when we visit Worthing. The Beach House on the seafront is one of my favourite places. Located between the pier and the Dome, it has a sunny terrace overlooking the beach and serves posh burgers, lots of vegan and vegetarian things (for my veggie sister) and local craft beer for thirsty parents.If we don’t want to leave the beach, Mum will order a takeaway from Pizzaface, a cool Brighton pizza shop that has just opened in Worthing. They also like CrabShack, another little restaurant by the sea that serves fresh crab and zingy cockle popcorn. But for a special meal try Pitch on Warwick Street, which is run by local chef Kenny Tutt, the winner of MasterChef 2018.Old-fashioned seaside treatsWhen I was younger, I loved riding a quadracycle, one of those big four-wheeled bikes with a stripy roof, along the seafront. But now I’m 13, it’s become a bit embarrassing to ride one with your parents!One thing I’ll never grow out of, though, is a knickerbocker glory from Macari’s, a cafe and ice-cream parlour on the seafront that’s retro inside. Apparently it’s been open for nearly 60 years, and has always been run by the same family. Mum says the knickerbocker glory still tastes the same as when she was a kid.It’s about a 15-minute walk from Macari’s back to the train station, just in time to catch one of the regular trains back home to Brighton.All aboardUp to four kids per adult can travel on most journeys for as little as £2 on Off-Peak and Super Off-Peak tickets with Southern (T\u0026ampCs apply).

If we were lucky, they said, we would meet a prince or princess and live happily ever after. If not, we would tread a lonely road to the grave, with only cats to comfort us.But an increasing number of “single-positive” people are rejecting the notion that true love is the only path to happiness. Just this week, the actor Emma Watson told Vogue how a “bloody influx of subliminal messaging” had left her “stressed and anxious” because she was heading into her 30s without a husband and baby. Now, however, she is “very happy” to be single. “I call it being self-partnered.”The pop star Selena Gomez, meanwhile, whose single-positive songs include Lose You to Love Me and Look at Her Now, has been talking about the fun she has had as a “super, super single” woman since splitting up with Justin Bieber two years ago. On Twitter, fellow singer Ariana Grande called the time since her split with Pete Davidson “one hell of a productive, emotional, wild and yet ... happy! year”. And as for Lizzo, currently touring the UK, she is proud to say she puts the “sing in single”. As she put it in her 2017 hit Truth Hurts: “I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be your side chick … Ain’t worried ’bout a ring on my finger.”Nor is Abi Jackson, 37, who fell in love with the single life in 2015 after the end of a five-year engagement. “Focusing on what you can gain from being single rather than what you’re missing is extremely empowering,” says the London-based writer. “I took up cycling as a hobby and absolutely loved it, which I might not have discovered if I hadn’t been single and pushing myself to try new things.” She has more time to focus on relationships with friends and family, as well as community activities such as volunteering with the Scouts. “We need to start saying: ‘You are enough as a single person’, otherwise it can start to define you.”Like a growing number of single women, Jackson says she takes herself out on dates. “Some people seem to think going to the cinema or having dinner by yourself is weird, but it’s brilliant. I dress up and really make the most of my night. I won’t hide away in the corner or apologise for being on my own.” Although she hasn’t ruled out being in a relationship, Jackson says dating turned her into a caricature. “It felt like I was being reduced to funny anecdotes about bad dates and failed flings. It’s easy to become hyperaware of that fairytale narrative, especially for women, but I don’t think being single should be framed around looking for love. It’s about developing a positive relationship with yourself.”Having dabbled with dating apps since 2017, it’s a feeling with which I’m familiar. While it’s easy to meet people online, I’ve always found it hard to make a real connection. There are only so many times I can swipe left on men called Zed who pose topless in their nan’s living room. Instead of sitting through another mediocre round of drinks with a teetotal accountant preparing for his next Tough Mudder, I would rather spend time doing the things I love. Whether that’s going to the theatre, visiting the farmers’ market or creating new recipes with my pretentious, overpriced vegetables, it feels more empowering to invest in your own passions. No one wants to end up like Bridget Jones, that vodka-slurping poster child for miserable spinsters.In 2018, the author Catherine Gray published a book about how her search for happiness had led her to take a year off dating. And what did she call it? The Unexpected Joy of Being Single.Danielle Wrate, 43, an editor and publisher, is also happy on her own. “Once you’ve found a way to enjoy your own company and go out alone, it’s liberating,” she says. “The stigma of being out alone is dying out. I see lots of people doing things by themselves now. I travel alone and get the best of both worlds, because I can always join day trips when I want some company.” Wrate is part of a local group called Sinkies, which stands for Single Income, No Kids. It was set up by a single woman who wanted to improve her social life there are regular pub quizzes, hikes and Sunday lunches. “There are a lot of members and it’s open to both sexes, but only women ever turn up.”This is indeed a trend that is largely led by women. But Rob Smith, 36, who runs a property development business on the south coast of England, points out that maintaining a happy relationship with yourself is just as important for men. “I’ve been single for five years and I’m very comfortable with it. I had a job that required me to travel frequently and I value my independence, freedom and flexibility,” he says. “I wouldn’t have been able to have a lot of the experiences I have had if I was in a relationship.” However, when his family started making jokes about his single status and pressuring him to settle down, he began to internalise their negativity. “I ended up going on a dating spree to try and find someone, which made me really unhappy.”After some soul-searching, he came to the conclusion that he was happier alone than trying to force a romance out of thin air. “I deleted all the apps and decided to go back to enjoying my single life.” He confronted his relatives about the comments they had been making, and asked them to respect his decision to be single. “I don’t think there’s as much pressure on men to settle down as there is for women, but it definitely exists. I’m very happy with my life and I needed my family to understand that.”Although he is open to the idea of having his own family in future, he says it will not affect his happiness. “Men are lucky because they have the option of having children much later,” he says. “I suppose that might be an added challenge for women.”According to Paul Dolan, a behavioural scientist from the London School of Economics, traditional benchmarks of adulthood such as marriage and children don’t always correlate with increased happiness. In fact, research included in his latest book, Happy Ever After, shows that women who remain single and child-free actually live longer, happier and healthier lives. Yet negative stereotypes about single women in particular can be pernicious. “Look at how Jennifer Aniston was portrayed for years,” says Jackson. “She was on the cover of every magazine as the woman who couldn’t get a man. The reality is she’s beautiful, successful and has an incredible life. She never needed our pity – and nor do other single women.”To reflect that reality, Nicola Slawson, 35, a journalist from Shropshire, set up the Single Supplement, a newsletter for single women. “A lot of the content aimed at women is condescending and negative,” she says. “It’s all about what to do with your partner or how to get a partner if you don’t have one. The assumption that being in a relationship is the norm is really infuriating. So I aim to write about the things that really matter to single women – everything from self-acceptance to practical issues like money management on a single income.”Like Wrate, Slawson is an advocate of solo travel. “I was advised against going to Morocco by myself as a single woman,” she says. “But I went anyway and had one of the best experiences of my life. You have to be careful, of course, but don’t let other people’s assumptions and ideals put you off doing something you want to do.”For others, a positive approach to singledom involves more than travelling alone or taking themselves out on dates. In 2015, Sophie Tanner, a digital consultant from Brighton, decided to embrace “sologamy”, the act of marrying oneself. “It was a slightly tongue-in-cheek statement against the stigma of being single. But people were incredibly supportive and took it seriously.” Tanner’s spiritual ceremony, which was presided over by a friend, was followed by a reception with her friends and family. By prioritising her relationship with herself, she says, she has developed as a person and found greater self-acceptance and happiness. “It was great to celebrate, because unless you marry or have children, there are no opportunities to celebrate your own happiness in adult life.”This year Tanner released her novel Reader, I Married Me, loosely based on her experiences of sologamy. “It’s an anti-romcom, where the character embraces the power of being on her own,” she says. Although she believes romantic love can bring happiness, Tanner maintains that having a positive relationship with yourself is more important. “It feels like there are more couples who are settling than those who are truly compatible. People could surprise themselves by realising how happy they could be on their own.”In a world geared up for couples, it’s easy to subscribe to the sad-single-female rhetoric that society thrusts in our direction. I was heartbroken when I split up with my last boyfriend after 16 months, but I quickly realised it saved me from the type of mediocre relationship that Tanner describes. Except for the days where I’m waging a one-woman war against a fitted sheet, I’m now much happier on my own.“As a society we are obsessed with finding the One,” Tanner says. “We tend to believe we can’t be fully happy unless we have that, which is just not true. It’s not the norm for people to find their soulmate, but because we put so much pressure on the importance of being with someone, people lower their expectations or put up with average or even toxic relationships.” Now 40, Tanner loves having time for her hobbies. “I enjoy solitude I love reading, writing and walking my dog by the sea.” She doesn’t get lonely. “Loneliness is an emotional response to feeling unloved and unseen, which can happen in or out of a relationship. It’s about feeling misunderstood or lacking connection. Happy solitude means you are comfortable in your own skin.”She says she is not bothered by the thought that she may never have children. “You don’t have to have children to complete you, in the same way that you don’t need a partner.”All you need, in fact, is self-belief. “I don’t see the point in apologising for existing as a single woman or sitting around feeling like I am waiting for my life to start,” says Slawson. “I just want to get out there and live it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af628bf8287019b88d9c70c845ccf8084b89e195/437_572_2670_1602/master/2670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b6ca4025652783009e5908c8516ae08","title":"have you seen any uk political adverts without disclosures on social media general election","story":"During the general election campaign we would like to hear about the political adverts you have seen on social media From 22 November political adverts will be banned on Twitter, however, other social media platforms such as Facebook will still allow them on their sites.Ahead of the UK general election we would like you to help us collect examples of political adverts running on social media which do not mention who has sponsored them.Political adverts on Facebook should clearly state who has paid for them in their posts.However, commercial adverts do not say who they are “paid for by” but only show that they are sponsored.If you have seen any political content on social media that does not clearly state who has paid for it we would like to hear from you.If you see an advert that does not say “paid for by” screenshot it.

Within two days, water leaked from the fitting into the downstairs flat. We filed our complaint, then had a local plumber come around to fix the leak. We assumed John Lewis would cover the cost of the repair and the damage. That’s why we chose to pay extra and shop with John Lewis: for peace of mind. Instead, a month-long war of attrition has resulted in customer service not accepting any responsibility. It told us to claim through our home insurance and stated that it will not be responding to any further correspondence from us. But here’s where it gets fun. Our home insurance is through … John Lewis. But when I explained our situation, the rep said it sounded like faulty workmanship which our policy doesn’t cover. So back to the store. As an aside, the machine, which is John Lewis’ own brand, broke last week. An engineer has since come around and fixed it. LP, LondonJohn Lewis reported its first ever half yearly loss in September, which it blamed on the prevailing pressures on the high street.The store claims you signed a form confirming there were no leaks before the installer left. Which is meaningless, because leaks can take hours, or days, to become apparent.It also blames you for booking your own plumber rather than doing so through your John Lewis home insurance. This ignores the fact that such faults aren’t covered by your policy and that, when you lodged your complaint, you were not told to wait for John Lewis to fix it.To your amazement you have now received a call offering to refund you the cost of the plumber and to pay for the repainting of the damaged downstairs flat. Sadly this seems prompted by the prospect of a headline rather than conscience.John Lewis still absolves itself of blame, despite the report from the plumber confirming that the leak was around the pipe fitting.“We believe the installation was carried out correctly,” it says . “However, as it is impossible to fully determine what caused the leak, we have offered to cover the costs associated with it as a gesture of goodwill.”If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

Sam Lund-Harket, a member of the Votey McVoteface campaign who lives on a houseboat, said: “The system discriminates against those living in temporary accommodation or part of a travelling community. These shockingly low registration figures prove that.“The Votey McVoteface website has put registration forms for people with no fixed address online in a fillable format for the first time, with guidance as to the information required and the process to follow.”Other constituencies with large numbers of residents living in canal boats include those in Milton Keynes. The group said rising housing costs in Bristol had led to the spread of people in insecure accommodation into nearby areas such as Jacob Rees-Mogg’s North East Somerset seat, which has significant numbers of people living on boats or in vans.

Congratulations! You are now at the centre of one of the most important events in human history. But now comes the hard part: what do you say in return – and, more importantly, how do you say it?For the past 200 years, the problem of interstellar communication with an extraterrestrial intelligence has vexed some of the world’s greatest scientists and mathematicians. Carl Friedrich Gauss, the mathematician and inventor of the heliotrope, suggested using a large array of mirrors Guglielmo Marconi and Nikola Tesla, pioneers of wireless communication, found a solution in radio waves and John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky, the progenitors of artificial intelligence, wanted to send computers into space as our extraterrestrial envoys.Any solution to the problem of interstellar communication comes laden with assumptions about the nature of extraterrestrial intelligence and inevitably reflects the technological sophistication of the era.The problem, briefly stated, is how to design a message that can be understood by an extraterrestrial intelligence about which you can know nothing with absolute certainty.This turns the design of interstellar messages into an exercise in identifying universals that can be presumed to be recognised by any entity endowed with higher intelligence. It is, in other words, the search for what may be called a language of the universe.As Galileo recognised in The Assayer, his foundational treatise on the scientific method, “this grand book, the universe, stands continually open to our gaze. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it.”Following Galileo’s lead, most systems designed for interstellar communication have been rooted in mathematics on the grounds that it would be understood by any intelligent extraterrestrials. But how does one discuss maths with an extraterrestrial?By the mid-19th century, scientists and mathematicians in Europe began to seriously consider methods for communicating with extraterrestrials that they believed might inhabit the moon and Mars. The first such system is attributed to Gauss, who developed a scheme “to get in touch with our neighbours on the moon” that involved creating a massive visual proof of the Pythagorean theorem in the Siberian tundra.This visual proof was to consist of a right triangle bordered on each side by squares and would be created by planting rows of trees for the borders and filling the interior of the space with wheat.Gauss’s proposal appears to have influenced the Austrian astronomer Joseph Johann von Littrow, who later advanced his own plan for establishing contact with our lunar neighbours. His design involved digging trenches in the Sahara in various geometric shapes, filling the trenches with water, topping them with kerosene, and then setting them alight to send flaming messages to the moon.For better or worse, neither of these outlandish schemes for extraterrestrial communication came to fruition. But another of Gauss’s proposals did exert a lasting influence on early European ideas for contacting extraterrestrials in our solar system.As the inventor of the heliotrope, a device that reflected light to send messages over long distances, Gauss envisioned an array of large mirrors that could be used to flash messages through interplanetary space.This idea was picked up by the eccentric poet and inventor Charles Cros, who petitioned the French government for funding to build a giant mirror that would use focused sunlight to burn messages into the surface of Mars. Alas, Cros’s request for funding was never granted.It wasn’t until the advent of wireless communication around the turn of the century that plans for communicating with extraterrestrial intelligence began to take on a more practical form.Early experiments in long-distance wireless transmission by Marconi and Tesla – both of whom were acutely aware of the implications of their inventions for interplanetary communication – proved that radio communication was a viable method for communicating with intelligent beings on other planets.But by the first decades of the 20th century, there was growing evidence that humans were the only intelligent life in our solar system. So we finally had a way to call ET, but there would be no one on the other end to pick up the phone.In 1932, Karl Jansky serendipitously observed radiation coming from the Milky Way while working at Bell Labs, thereby inaugurating the science of radio astronomy and turning the entire galaxy into fertile hunting grounds for extraterrestrial life.The first scientific attempt to determine whether we are alone in the galaxy was undertaken by the planetary astronomer Frank Drake at the Green Bank radio observatory in 1960. Over the course of four months, he spent several hours a day observing two nearby stars for any signs of intelligent life.He came up empty handed, but this is hardly surprising. Had Drake discovered life around these stars, it would either be a remarkable coincidence or suggest the universe is teeming with intelligent life.Still, Drake recognised the nascent search for extraterrestrial intelligence had a glaring blind spot. If we ever did hear from an extraterrestrial, how would we go about designing a response?Over the course of the next decade, Drake and some of the world’s pre-eminent scientists devoted considerable intellectual energy to solving this problem. In 1971, researchers from the US and the Soviet Union convened at the Byurakan Observatory in Armenia for the first joint conference on communication with extraterrestrial intelligence and to share their research.Although scientists on both sides of the iron curtain had been working on this problem separately for years, cold war tensions had made it prohibitively difficult to collaborate.But as the Soviet astronomer Iosif Shklovsky remarked before the conference, the prospect of communicating with an extraterrestrial intelligence seemed dim if communication between countries was impossible. In this sense, the conference was as much about easing geopolitical tensions on Earth as it was about communicating with ETs.Presiding over the talks was a young Carl Sagan, who fielded interstellar communication proposals from the attendees that were as plentiful as they were fanciful: for example, the extraterrestrial communication proposal floated by the astronomer James Elliot that involved detonating the world’s nuclear arsenal on the far side of the moon. In his analysis of Starfish Prime, a powerful nuclear detonation conducted by the US in space in 1962, he calculated that the x-rays from this explosion could be detected at up to 400 astronomical units, or about 10 times the distance of Pluto from the sun.While this is not nearly far enough to be detected in another solar system, Elliot suggested that simultaneously detonating all of Earth’s nuclear weapons on the far side of the moon might do the trick.Based on his estimation of the size of the US and Soviet nuclear stockpiles and an assumption that a device could be developed that would focus the detonation’s resulting x-rays toward a desired target, Elliot calculated that a blast of this magnitude could be detected at up to 190 light years from Earth.It would be a remarkable way to introduce ourselves, but extraterrestrials would have to be observing Earth at the time of the blast, which Elliot conceded made it a less than practical proposal.Though a number of other exotic interstellar communication schemes were floated during the Armenia conference, most of the attendees focused on radio waves as a mundane but eminently more practical communication medium.There were plenty of pragmatic concerns to be addressed when it came to radio transmissions, such as the ideal transmission frequency and choice of stellar targets, but one of the more pressing questions concerned the nature of the message’s content.Among the various proposals for interstellar messages raised at Byurakan, one especially stands out: Minsky, widely regarded as the father of AI, suggested it would be best to send a cat as our extraterrestrial delegate.Behind his humour is a serious proposal. During the conference, attendees debated the best way to convey information about life on Earth, such as the existence of cats. A number of attendees argued that images or symbolic messages would probably be the best way to proceed, but Minsky disagreed.“Instead of sending a very difficult-to-decode educational message and instead of sending a picture of a cat, there is one area in which we can send the cat itself,” Minsky said. “Briefly, the idea is that we can transmit computers.”In Minsky’s mind, an ideal interstellar message would teach an extraterrestrial how to run computer software that could then teach it about life on Earth. This would allow for a far more energy efficient and information rich message when compared with trying to capture the same information in pictures of symbolic messages.The future of interstellar messaging will probably be a mixture of state-of-the-art technology and human culture. Just like the golden records attached to the Voyager spacecraft that departed for interstellar space in the 1970s, each interstellar message is a reflection of the culture that created it.In the 1970s, it was a phonograph record filled with everything from 50s rock and roll music to traditional music from Papua New Guinea. More recently, the Sónar messages broadcast from a radar in Norway contained a unique artificial language designed for interstellar communication and short electronic music clips designed by an international collection of musicians.Tomorrow, our messages will be even more sophisticated. The Seti Institute’s Earthling project, for instance, is amassing a database of sounds submitted by users around the world, which will be electronically remixed to create unique songs that try to capture human music as a gestalt before it is broadcast into space.In the nearly 50 years since the Byurakan conference, the art and science of interstellar message design has continued to evolve in ways that reflect advances in transmission technology and our understanding of human cognition.Since we have yet to achieve first contact, humans remain the only animal in the known universe endowed with higher intelligence, which manifests in our ability to wield language, mathematics, and artistic representation.Our interstellar messages inevitably reflect human biases and conventions, and may never be seen by an extraterrestrial intelligence. But by continuing to explore the problem of interstellar communication, we can learn a lot about what it means to be human in preparation for the day that we discover we’re not alone.• Daniel Oberhaus is the author of Extraterrestrial Languages, published by MIT Press"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b4614166937066b1a04485cfd5924ba4d147483/0_114_5268_3161/master/5268.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bb40de23f0eec4b18bb40c1e7cb55b2","title":"jeremy hughes alzheimers society dementia winner general election","story":"When he recently stayed in a care home to experience life as a resident, Jeremy Hughes witnessed the admission of an elderly woman from hospital. Before she was even shown her room, she and her daughter were taken to the manager’s office and asked how they intended to meet the difference between the home’s fees and what the council was prepared to pay on her behalf.“The inhumanity when people are under enormous stress has got to end. We cannot put up with that,” says Hughes, chief executive of the Alzheimer’s Society, the UK’s leading dementia charity, which this week celebrates the 40th anniversary of the letter that led to its founding. The charity wants social care reform to be as big an issue in the general election campaign as it was in the 2017 contest.Hughes, 62, thinks there’s “a fair chance” of winning reform if the issue gets traction over the next five weeks. The Alzheimer’s Society will be urging election candidates to meet some of the estimated 850,000 people living with dementia, and their carers, to hear what needs to change. “We’ll gladly help them to do that,” he says. “But we’ll also publicise them if they don’t.”It’s a comment reflecting his reputation as a wily campaigner who, during his nine years in the job, has more than doubled the charity’s annual income to about £110m, signed up 3 million people to be “dementia friends” – an idea he readily admits to having pinched from Japan – and stimulated the set-up of more than 400 dementia-friendly communities. He has also been willing to work with both the Daily Mail and  newspapers on their respective campaigns against the dementia tax – even though he acknowledges their main focus is enabling homeowners to avoid having to sell their properties to pay for care.He is, he says, aware of the risks of framing the debate in a way that not only excludes people whose care is funded by the state, but also makes the economic issue the overriding concern at the expense of care quality, and marginalises younger people with support needs. His relationship with the mid-market tabloids is, he admits, “love-hate”. But it has undoubtedly helped win him regular access to decision-makers up to and including Downing Street.In September, he accompanied actor Barbara Windsor, who has a dementia diagnosis and is an ambassador for the Alzheimer’s Society, for a highly publicised meeting with Boris Johnson after he had promised extra funding for social care. “He was desperately trying to get her to say how wonderful he was,” says Hughes. “She, to her great credit, stuck to her guns and said, no, it was not marvellous – people still had to pay for their own care.think he thought about it more in that half-hour than he had ever thought about it before.”He is now “more confident than before” that long-awaited reform will happen, including action to address what the Alzheimer’s Society says is a need for a £2.4bn a year “dementia fund” for England to end unfairness in the system. He is also upbeat about the prospects of a breakthrough in research into drugs for dementia, after it emerged“ that US company Biogen is seeking regulatory approval for a drug, aducanumab, which has shown new promise in tests in slowing mental deterioration. We are not that far from having a non-invasive diagnostic tool to identify those at risk in their 40s and 50s, with the potential now also of developing a statin-type drug that can arrest progress of the disease,” he says.He will stay in the field as chair of the World Dementia Council, which he takes up next year, but he is looking for another executive post in a different, if related, sphere. “Some kind of public services role, which may or may not be a charity,” he muses. “I’ve always helped organisations and causes move forward, make a step change, and I’m keen to do that again with somebody if they want me.”Family Married, two adult sons.Lives Dorset London during the week.Education Harrow school (son of chaplain) St Edmund Hall, University of Oxford (BA geography).Career 2010-present: chief executive, the Alzheimer’s Society 2005-10: chief executive, Breakthrough Breast Cancer 2003-05: head of external relations and communications, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies 1999-2003: director of marketing and income generation, British Red Cross 1996-99: director of public affairs, Leonard Cheshire 1994-96: director of marketing and communications, Muscular Dystrophy Group 1991-94: assistant director, policy and information, NCH Action for Children 1986-91: director, LMS Public Relations 1983-86: political officer, Co-operative Retail Services, London region 1980-83: joint general secretary, Chile Solidarity Campaign.Public life Vice-chair and chair designate, World Dementia Council member, NHS Assembly made CBE in 2015."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19596b1aaaeff7d7ff97205de8751f5fc02acd87/439_461_2488_1493/master/2488.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbdea429e8547a0f50f1f623bbf21f5d","title":"fitbit google acquisition health data","story":"Fitbit says data of its 28 million users will not be sold or used for Google adsGoogle’s recent acquisition of Fitbit for $2.1bn has left many users worried the tech giant may soon have access to their most intimate health information – from the number of steps they take each day to their breathing patterns, sleep quality or menstrual cycles.Fitbit, founded in San Francisco in 2007, tracks the health data of 28 million users. In a blogpost following the acquisition on Friday, Fitbit claimed user data would not be sold or used for Google advertising. “Consumer trust is paramount to Fitbit. Strong privacy and security guidelines have been part of Fitbit’s DNA since day one, and this will not change,” the company said in a statement.Still, dozens of Fitbit wearers complained on social media over the weekend about the Google takeover. “I tossed my Fitbit into the trash today,” one user tweeted. “I intend to sell my Fitbit and delete my account,” said another.Google already keeps a trove of information on people, including location data, search history and YouTube viewing history. The company also creates advertisement profiles of users based on information such as location, gender, age, hobbies, career, interests, relationship status, possible weight (need to lose 10lb in one day?) and income.Veronica KB Olsen, a research fellow at Cern in Geneva, said she immediately requested her data be deleted upon hearing news of the merger.“I am usually careful about big tech companies gobbling up too much data, but especially Google,” she said. “I have a knee-jerk reaction to Google having any of my data. I try to opt out of most of the stuff they do.”Because Olsen is based in Europe, Fitbit is required to delete her data if she requests it under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect in 2018. Under GDPR, users are also entitled to copies of their own data.But users in any location, even outside the EU, can delete their accounts via the Fitbit website. The company said it would then permanently delete data associated with the account after a seven-day grace period.Olsen was sent a copy of the data collected during the last year she owned the device, a huge tranche of information that included her heart rate taken every few seconds. She said that even if Fitbit claims it does not share health data with Google, she didn’t want to take a chance by giving it more information.“The more data points you have on someone, the more you can build a profile of their life,” she said.The Fitbit acquisition comes despite recent antitrust scrutiny faced by Google after a US government inquiry into its impact on competition was announced in September. The investigation is meant to focus on the company’s advertising practices but could extend to its acquisitions of competing firms.Google founded its own fitness tracking service, Google Fit, in 2014, but it has relied on third parties such as Fossil and Tag Heuer to produce Android-compatible smartwatches.Even if Google claims it won’t use Fitbit health data for advertising, the acquisition is probably bad for user privacy, said Paul Bischoff, a privacy advocate with Comparitech. Just because the companies say user data will not be used for advertising now does not mean that won’t change, he said.“Fitbit says health and wellness data will not be used for advertising, but that leaves plenty of other information for Google to gather, including users’ locations, device info, friends’ lists, messages, profile photos, participation in employee wellness programs, and usage logs,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73d3279777421ce172b12c1683070709ceab6175/389_567_4142_2486/master/4142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=befdfee22d11db3a275afaa1da31e4b2","title":"google nest hub max review display camera facial recognition","story":"Camera with local AI for face recognition allows proactive display of personalised informationGoogle’s latest smart display is larger and can recognise your face for proactively showing you personalised information making it just that little bit smarter than competitors.The £219 Nest Hub Max is Google’s second own-brand smart display and is essentially a super-sized version of the excellent original Home Hub (now renamed Nest Hub). But where the Nest Hub is a veritable bargain at £119 or frequently much less, the Nest Hub Max is a different proposition at a little under twice the price.A bigger screen is definitely better for viewing from across a room. The 10in 720p HD screen is bright, crisp enough at normal viewing distances and has Google’s ambient EQ colour tone system so that photos on it look very much like printed photos, not displayed on an overly white and clinical LCD screen.If you use Google Photos, the Hub Max is the best digital photoframe you can buy by far, pulling your pictures from your library and looking fantastic doing it. I’m still amazed at just how good it is to have my cherished memories from holidays and good times seamlessly displayed around the house.The larger display also makes seeing text and information retrieved from questions and commands easier from across the room compared with the 7in display on the Hub Max’s smaller sibling. Video is also better.YouTube is integrated, of course, as are Netflix and All 4, meaning they can be directly commanded via voice. Other services can be Chromecast to the display from your phone, which makes it more versatile than Amazon’s Echo Show devices. That means BBC iPlayer and ITV Hub, but not Amazon Prime Video in the UK, which doesn’t see the Hub Max despite supporting dedicated Chromecasts.Other than on-screen things, the Hub Max does anything a regular Google smart speaker does making it the best question answering machine you can buy. Timers, alarms, reminders, requests for the weather and most other questions are accompanied by visual information, such as a photo of the actor you’ve just asked about.Assistant has a short-term memory too, so you can ask multiple questions on the same topic without repeating the topic. It works well.The Hub Max, however, has a harder time hearing you than other Google smart speakers. I’m not sure why, but you have to speak more directly to it. But as a consequence not once has it activated by accident when I wasn’t talking to it, which is a big plus for privacy as much as being less irritated by the occasional random outbursts frequently experienced with smart speakers.The speakers are hidden in the fabric pedestal that supports the screen. The Hub Max has two 18 mm tweeters aiming forwards and one 75 mm woofer aiming backwards for richer sound than the smaller Hub. It sounds good, able to fill a room without sounding overly shrill or loud, but not much better than a standard Google Home and not quite on par with the Amazon’s larger Echo Show. It is good enough for watching videos while cooking and for a full rendition of Assistant’s voice, but it won’t match a Sonos One, Home Max or similar for audio quality.The big new addition for the Hub Max is a camera, which some will see as a mixed blessing, introducing more worries about privacy. The camera is used for several things. The first is video calling via Google Duo, which I did once for testing and then never thought about again. It worked well enough with a good wide angle to fit you in frame, but video calling just never seems worth the faff on any device for me.More interestingly the Hub Max can use the camera to recognise faces and hand gestures. The Face Match system works on-device, meaning the camera isn’t constantly streaming to the internet and being used to surveil your every move. It’s really rather impressive and, rather than being a gimmick, I found it genuinely useful.When it recognises me or a family member it proactively shows information relevant to whomever is standing in front of it on cards on the screen. Perhaps that’s your calendar appointments for the day, your reminders, your commute or other personal bits. A little chime, my photo and a small greeting appears on screen when it sees me. It feels far smarter, more intelligent use of the display and was very much the killer feature for me.Of course it can recognise you or members of your family with Voice Match too. In the morning you simply say “Hey, Google, good morning” and it’ll rattle off your customisable routine of weather, commute, news and so on. Assistant can even reply with different voices for different people, which is quite fun.Gestures for controlling media playback or Assistant speech work well. Show it a hand and the video or audio pauses. That’s handy if you don’t want to shout at it or touch the screen.Finally, the camera can also be used as a Nest surveillance camera similar to one of Google’s dedicated Nest cameras. You can view it any time from the Nest app, automatically turn it off and on when you’re at home or on a schedule, get motion and noise notifications and with a Nest Aware subscription you can record video. It works great, except for two things. If it’s on a shelf the upwards angle of the camera is a bit too high to be useful and there’s no night vision like a dedicated Nest cam so it’s not great in the dark. To be clear it’s not as good as a dedicated Nest Cam IQ, which is £299 on its own.The Hub Max has the same smart home control system as its smaller sibling. Swipe down from the top to access a collection of your smart home tech including a quick summary of what’s on, what the temperature is and other bits you might have.Panels for lights, routines, media, broadcast, thermostats and cameras allow you to jump straight in and control things, or you can view your devices grouped by rooms as in the Google Home app. If you’re not a fan of commanding things via voice and more want a central control panel this is it.You can view streams from supported smart cameras such as Nest and Arlo, but not Amazon’s Ring cameras, and if you have a Nest Hello, when the doorbell rings a live view of the front door pops up so you can immediately see who it is.The Google Nest Hub Max costs £219 and is available in white or charcoal.The Google Nest Hub Max is the best smart display you can buy because it’s simply smarter than the rest. Most smart displays have to wait for you to invoke something before showing useful, personalised information, or they show the same things to everyone in your home.Face Match allows the large screen to be the central at-a-glance information source for all the family, personalised to the inidual, not just whomever set the thing up in the first place.There are privacy implications of having a camera, as there are putting microphones in your home, but Google has negated my webcam fears by making the useful functionality powered by local AI and not constantly streaming a feed of me to the internet. You have to trust the manufacturer to buy a product like this.Having photos displayed on the 10in screen with tonal matching to ambient light is excellent so is watching Netflix or YouTube on it. Smart home control is excellent, if Assistant supports your devices. The morning routines are quite good, and it sounds good enough. Sometimes it can’t hear me as well enough as I would like, but on the flipside it never once activated errantly listening in on conversations because it thought I was talking to it.While a price of £219 is in line with competitors of this size, it’s still fairly expensive when 7in versions can frequently be bought for less than £100. But if you’re looking for the smartest, most useful smart display, the Nest Hub Max is it.Cons: expensive, sound could be better, no Ring integration, no Amazon Prime Video or Sky support, privacy implications This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

His retrospective will be published by Siedl in 2020, with an accompanying exhibition at CO BerlinI moved to East Berlin, from Dresden, at the end of the 1970s. I lived in Prenzlauer Berg for most of my time there, on different streets – Kastanienallee, Winsstrasse, Choriner-Strasse. It was one of the most interesting places to be for an artist, because all the activists and dissidents were there, too. We could squat the houses, or at least not pay much rent, because they were all in such bad condition and the landlords were (mostly) happy just to have someone in there who could maintain them. Those in power, including the Stasi, were confused by our scene as they couldn’t access it, or at least not completely. There were lots of small groups rather than one big scene. It was a real community back then but the photography style I used was, of course, challenging. Not just because the Stasi were always breathing down my neck but because if I turned up at an event with my camera equipment people would often think I was with the Stasi! I always tried to wave conspicuously to the right people, to reassure everyone that I wasn’t working for them. My long hair helped. One of the worst experiences I had during those years, though, was not down to the Stasi or being a photographer: it was when I had to do army service as a reservist. I was a single parent and they put my eight-year-old daughter in an orphanage for six months. This was a heavy time as I knew she was unhappy, and I was too.Harald recommends The Volksbühne theatre, which was active during the GDR era. Tierpark Berlin is a great zoo in the East, and the Turkish Market on the Maybachufer has a great atmosphere.Born in London, Berlin resident since 2007. Co-founder Bildband BerlinI first arrived in Berlin in 1985, when I was 24. It was to visit a friend from London who was living on Sonnenallee in West Berlin. Their place was cheap: it had a shared toilet in the hall and was just a couple of blocks from the Wall. Somehow it seemed impolite to go and stare at the Wall it was something everyone had to deal with but tried to ignore. I took a couple of trips into the East on a 24-hour visa, crossing at Friedrichstrasse. It mostly reminded me of the London I had grown up in: bomb sites and patched-up buildings, and the way communal space was shared. I visited again in January 1989, as a photojournalist covering the Festival of Political Songs, and met a Hungarian who showed me how to lose my Stasi minder, and I hung out with him and his East German mates for a few days. I actually watched the Wall come down from London. By the time I got back to Berlin for Christmas 1990 it was the middle of a very cold winter and there was just a space where the Wall had been. Instead of taking hours to get through the checkpoints, you could just cross the road and be in a different city, a parallel universe. I don’t think anyone was ready for that.Joe recommends The Russian memorial at Treptower Park, the flea markets in Spandau and Marzahn, the Berlinische Galerie, CO Berlin photo gallery, 8mm Bar, Bar Tomsky, Dream Baby Dream bar. My favourite place in the world though is the Plötzensee boathouse cafe, near my studio in Wedding.Born and lives in Berlin, where she runs We Are Not Alone raves at GriessmuehleI was sleeping when the Wall fell. I didn’t believe the news at first but then I got out of bed, turned on the TV and started to cry. Even as a child, I always felt that my friends and I were somewhat imprisoned in West Berlin. There was always a strong military presence in the city: tanks on the streets, allied military exercises. My family was also separated by the Wall: one part living in the West, the rest in the East. If I wanted to visit my relatives in East Berlin, I had to go through the border crossings, which were always strictly controlled and always frightening. So, when the Wall came down, it gave me a real sense of freedom that I can still feel within me today. Initially, it meant I could discover the eastern part, which was around the same time the club scene exploded. My circle of friends changed within two years and my future from that point on was music. I started playing in those early clubs like Tresor and E-Werk. Ever since, techno has been something emotional for me, not just a short-lived trend it represents a special time and a permanent feeling in my life.Ellen recommends My favourite restaurant is Prater in Prenzlauer Berg because it still has such an original look and atmosphere. I also enjoy going to (and not just playing at) clubs such as Griessmuehle and Berghain. A cafe favourite s is Altes Europa in Mitte’s Gipsstrasse, which was also around before the fall of the Wall.Born in the US, Berlin resident since 1987, co-creator of Love Parade, which ran from 1989 to 2010I came to West Berlin in 1987 and was blown away at how it was cheap but also safe – a rare combination at that time, especially coming from New York. A friend was already living there, and the first place I found was a huge loft space, which I shared. It cost me around 30 marks a month (which would be about €15 today). The film Wings of Desire had just been released and I had watched it the night before leaving. It felt like pretty much everyone from the movie was living in or passing through this loft: musician Roland Wolf, Nick Cave and other members of the Bad Seeds, members of Einstürzende Neubauten. I thought I’d died and gone to heaven. A year later, I started dating Dr Motte, with whom I started the Love Parade. Our apartment was on what is now Axel-Springer-Strasse and the front door was a few metres from the Wall. In fact, the kitchen window looked over the Wall, and there was a watchtower opposite, so we had to buy net curtains to stop them peeking in. In the winter of 1989 I left Berlin for a performance in Austria. Motte, who is a Berliner, called in tears while I was there, to tell me the Wall was down. I arrived back in Berlin the morning after, about 7am. It had snowed and there was no one at the checkpoints. I waited for half an hour anyway, as normally you had to stop or get shot, and we didn’t know if the guards might be hiding. Afterwards, they pulled up a piece of the Wall outside our house and we walked right into East Berlin and started to discover the streets, and all the empty buildings.Danielle recommends The Mauerpark flea market. Berlin was one of few places back in the 80s that had good flea markets, and every time I go I get that feeling of the old Berlin. The karaoke singing there in the summer is great, too. I also like Arkaoda, a club in Neukölln that’s Turkish-run and is multicultural the music director also runs the amazing Fusion festival. For restaurants, try Kopps, a vegan spot that has a delicious Saturday and Sunday buffet.German-born, Berlin resident since 1990I came to Berlin from a town near Hamburg. The Wall had just fallen, which made it the most fascinating German city to live in, and I had just finished school and had family and friends here. The idea was to study but I soon got caught up with different projects, mostly organising concerts at the venues that were popping up around Mitte – Tacheles, Schokoladen, IM Eimer, ACUD – but also theatre and spoken word, too. There was a lot of crossover between disciplines as well as people in those days. The scene didn’t feel small but everyone still seemed to know each other. We were all living and running the houses we lived in, fixing the toilets and painting the windows instead of paying rent. My favourite part was working with the bands from the former Soviet bloc. We’d work with all the local venues to arrange a kind of mini-tour for them in Berlin, to justify them coming. As well as a lot of great punk and folk music, we also had amazing conversations that it hadn’t been possible to have before. This community feel was really special. There was a sense of belonging to the city. It wasn’t about money. I don’t think that exists in the same way anymore.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

The second crashed into a field. Both had tumbled from a B-52G Stratofortress after a mid-air refuelling snafu that led to a wing falling off and three of the eight-strong crew dying in the resulting crash. If either of the 3.8 megaton bombs had detonated that day in January 1961, Big Daddy Road in North Carolina would have suffered the equivalent of 250 Hiroshimas.“Given the nature of basic human ineptitude, one question stands out,” said the US comedian sagely, in Rich Hall’s Red Menace (BBC Four), his deadpan history of the cold war. “How did we not blow each other up?”Good question. In hindsight, it is amazing that there are humans around to have hindsight. The bomb in the tree had its arming switch set to “on”. Why didn’t it go off? The faithful of Big Daddy Road had an answer: God used His manual override. Attendance at the local baptist church tripled the year after the incident.Cold war Americans were less likely to kill Soviets with nuclear weapons than themselves, Hall argued. At Los Alamos in 1945, one scientist was rearranging tungsten carbide bricks around a plutonium core for a test called “tickling the dragon’s tail”. But he inadvertently dropped one of the bricks on the core, producing a blue flash of light, a mule kick of heat, and 25 days later his death from radiation sickness. The core was moved to a new site to keep it safer, but within a year another physicist was beating out time with a screwdriver between two beryllium spheres that surrounded the core so he could hear metronomic changes on a Geiger counter. “When he reached the approximate tempo of The Girl from Ipanema,” Hall reported, “the screwdriver slipped, the spheres came together – blue light, mule kick and nine days later he was dead.” That’s the next episode of Horrible Histories’ Stupid Deaths sorted.Russian scientists were not to be outdone in this race to climb Mount Stupid. One Soviet physicist put his head in a particle accelerator, which had an interesting consequence. Half his face didn’t age thereafter. Perhaps, suggested Hall, we should all do the same to attain eternal youth. No, really, after you, Mr Hall.Worse, the Soviets built plutonium facility No 817 in the Urals after the second world war and pumped its waste into a river. In 1957, waste tanks exploded, sending up radioactive clouds that spread over an area inhabited by 270,000 Russians, only 11,000 of whom were evacuated. Hundreds died. Hall noted the site of the Kyshtym disaster has been rebranded as the East Ural Nature Reserve. To be fair, that sounds nicer than Still A Carcinogenic Radioactive Wasteland.While Russian and American brainiacs were busy self-harming or narrowly avoiding slaying millions of their own citizens, other patriots fought proxy conflicts in basketball, chess and ice hockey. Even literature became a front in the cold war. The CIA funded a Russian edition of Pasternak’s banned Doctor Zhivago and leaned on the Nobel committee to give the author the literature prize. It was, Hall supposed, a brilliant secret weapon devised to bore as many Russians to death as possible. Only the fact that nobody finished the book explained why its body count was disappointing.Hall’s thesis was that the red menace was all sizzle and no steak. Rather, unprecedented US affluence produced anxiety – all those tail-finned Cadillacs and over-sized barbecues might disappear just as quickly as they had appeared. Such anxiety only needed a nudge from Senator Eugene McCarthy and allegorical sci-fi films such as Invasion of the Body Snatchers, to escalate into full-blooded terror of the Other.As for the Russians, Hall supposed, “The idea of invading America didn’t enter their minds. They were too exhausted.” Purges, show trials, bread queues, five-year plans, gulags, religious persecution and pumping athletes with performance-enhancing drugs – all militated against reds being under American beds. They were most likely asleep in their own.Who won the cold war, Hall asked himself. Nobody, he replied. Instead, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the former foes copied the worst of each other. America’s president is more Stalin than Kennedy in his lies, intimidation and smear tactics. Putin’s Russia has become ruthlessly capitalist. “It’s a gas station with rusty nukes out back,” said Hall. Which made me feel smug until I realised Britain is becoming like Russia – minus the gas station."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55b7c249e37cabc6a258dec8bcb5be89608bc70b/0_396_5940_3564/master/5940.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01887b3016b66e82485815ea046eaddc","title":"the morning show jennifer aniston metoo","story":"The star-studded, $15m-an-episode series is a scramble of bad dialogue and thinly sketched characters yet its handling of sexual politics is grimly transfixing It takes until over halfway through the second episode of Apple TV+’s The Morning Show – after Jennifer Aniston’s genuinely impressive return to TV as an exposure-steeled morning news anchor, after the reveal of her co-star Reese Witherspoon’s bad brunette wig, after 90 minutes of taking in what an alleged $15m an episode can buy in set design — for me to knee-jerk pause the show.I needed extra time to ponder a line delivered by Chip Black (Mark Duplass), the fictional Morning Show’s executive producer, who arrives on his #MeToo-deposed former anchor Mitch Kessler’s (Steve Carell) doorstep to beg him to stand down days after his firing. Kessler – clearly based on the former Today show host Matt Lauer and, at this point, fired for undisclosed reports of sexual misconduct – compares the #MeToo movement to McCarthyism, a spineless mob with no regard for his own defense. Fine, Black responds: “I’ll say it – we’re being too fast to judge men in the court of public opinion. I agree with you. The whole #MeToo movement is probably an overcorrection for centuries of bad behavior that more enlightened men like you and me had nothing to do with.”I hit pause and thought, sincerely: “Oh shit, they really wrote this?” It’s a bold choice for Apple TV+’s marquee original show – a line that seems more like a summary of a certain strain of op-ed than the natural flow of conversation and one impossible to process solely within the world of the show, even if Kessler’s case didn’t overlap so blatantly with Lauer’s. Maybe I was missing something, I wondered at this point, viewers don’t know the specific allegations against Kessler or anything about the women who made them – what, then, was the point of airing this out? Or of hearing Kessler defiantly declare: “At first they came for the rapists and I did not speak up, because I am not a rapist. And then they came for the powerful men, and you did not speak out, because you are not a powerful man”?If this is a portrait of male defensiveness and denial in the wake of #MeToo, it’s a messy, haphazard one, somehow both on the nose on what fascinates us and totally obtuse in filtering that toward an insightful end. And yet, I found it impossible to look away. On some level, it’s deeply compelling to imagine what these conversations, between people whose power is far too massive for the vast majority of us to comprehend, look like. The mechanisms and beliefs that protected men like Lauer for years were so obscure or coded that the illusion of getting a glimpse of them in action, even a quasi-fictional one, is seductive. But I think it’s also simpler than that on a level that’s more instinct than intellect, I just want to see TV grapple with #MeToo directly, in the real world of virality and bad takes, even if it’s messy, even if I frequently pause and shout “NO!” at the dialogue.Since the New York Times and New Yorker reporting on Harvey Weinstein unleashed the deluge of sexual harassment and abuse stories under the banner of #MeToo, there have been repeated calls for better, less reductive conversations about the movement – a focus on what happens to the women who come forward instead of the toppled men, for example, or a shift from headlines to healing. #MeToo has radically unmasked systems of abusive power in the United States, systems of silence and corrosive protection – especially in the media, where it has done an unprecedented job of removing toxic stars from power, even if their poisonous orbits have, as is becoming clear in books such as She Said and especially Ronan Farrow’s Catch and Kill, remained largely in place.Thus, if Apple TV+ was going to make a show about the most mainstream of legacy media – the morning network news show – and set it in the year 2019, it was going to have to address the #MeToo landscape, at least obliquely. But The Morning Show goes full throttle on the phenomenon of #MeToo, transparently inspired by the saga at NBC News and Lauer, removed from Today in fall 2017 after an HR report of sexual assault (Farrow later revealed this to be rape), and the question of who knew what and when. This is evident from the first scene in the series, in which Kessler receives a 3am call from Black on his ouster. The subsequent unspooling of events – shocked faces in the office, raw but composed on-air processing by co-star Alex Levy (Aniston), immediate but seemingly surface-level sympathy for the women, Kessler’s scathing denials – align so closely to the world we live in and the media diet of these events that it could almost be the real thing. Except when you sink your teeth into The Morning Show (or, at least, the three episodes available to review), the feel is often cardboard – lines about “this #MeToo moment” and getting pilloried on social or videos called “Mitch Kessler speaks to award-winning director about sexual harassment allegations” feel like they could be said by real people in 2019 but are more signpost than substance. It’s akin to catching your reflection in water: the outlines and features are there but the details are slippery, shifting. You don’t turn here to see the world more clearly.And yet, that reflection is still transfixing. The Morning Show can often be frustrating, particularly in its oven-mitt handling of #MeToo, and yet I find it compulsively watchable, even fun. I’m hungry to see these landmark #MeToo events, which I and many others have followed, played out on screen without the often distracting verisimilitude of, say, actors playing Roger Ailes or Gretchen Carlson. It’s baseline compelling to see a story set itself firmly in a world saturated by #MeToo headlines for two years, in part because the movement has supercharged the question of separating art and artist, your complicity in what you view for entertainment. I’m suspicious of my impulse to watch storylines of #MeToo, to be a voyeur to other people’s moral qualms, failings, dilemmas. I wonder if maybe that is part of the problem, harnessing #MeToo for relevance rather than examining it.And yet, even with the occasionally terrible dialogue, the weird focus on Kessler, a cringey office romance and the incongruence of Reese Witherspoon’s ingenue character, I’m still fascinated by the idea of seeing these #MeToo conversations in progress. Maybe, in time, the $15m spent by the world’s most profitable company will harvest more to say on #MeToo than a loose reflection. But in the meantime, I’m still watching."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/912b1791b0780ecef7ccfcf5f64db54fc2ced3b4/0_541_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48073f0676cee9bf1a77cffc639274e9","title":"tv tonight grand designs kevin mccloud riba house of the year watch tonight","story":"Grand Designs is just one step away from finding the RIBA’s top house of 2019.

The other received 15 years, with the sentence to be reviewed after eight years.They were 13 when they killed Ana Kriégel, 14, in a derelict house in the Dublin suburb of Lucan in May 2018. Because of their age they were not named and were referred to as Boy A and Boy B.Now 15, they became the youngest people in Irish history to be convicted of murder when the jury returned unanimous verdicts in June after a harrowing seven-week trial that evoked comparisons to the 1993 James Bulger atrocity.Mr Justice Paul McDermott deferred sentencing until this week to take into account probation and psychological reports.He said the killers could gain freedom while they were still relatively young men. “When that will be is not yet determined but much is based on your behaviour and attitude during your detention.”Addressing both boys, he said: “You will have to carry the guilt and shame of your involvement for the rest of your lives … at least you will have the opportunity to reconstruct yours in a positive way. Will you take it? You have the opportunity for a future and second chance, something you so wrongfully and cruelly denied to Ana.”He said Ana’s life was of “supreme importance” and that she had lived it “with energy, fun, imagination, love, dancing and music”.Prosecutors said Boy B called at Ana’s house and led her to a nearby derelict house where Boy A, whom she had a crush on, was waiting. He had assembled a “murder kit”: zombie mask, black gloves, shin guards, knee pads. His weapons were a long stick and a concrete block.Boy A received an eight-year sentence for sexual assault, to run concurrently with the murder sentence.During the trial, Boy A denied murder but the court heard he now appears to have accepted he killed Ana. He still denies sexual assault. Boy B admitted watching his friend attack Ana but still maintains his innocence in the murder.The boys will remain in Oberstown, Ireland’s only child detention campus, until they turn 18, when they will be moved to an adult prison to serve the balance of their sentence.The judge said there was little guidance relating to sentencing children for murder because “thankfully” there were so few cases. He had the power to impose a life term but that was not mandatory in the case of minors.In a victim impact statement, Ana’s mother, Geraldine, eulogised her daughter, who was adopted from Russia as a toddler, and spoke of the anguish of losing her.“She was wild and wonderful, electric, so full of fun, madness and laughter … she was the love of our lives.”She said there was no way to describe the pain and nightmares that followed the murder. “We brought Ana to live in a ‘safe’ place, a quiet country village, a leafy suburb, where the only sounds in the morning are doves cooing. No one could suspect the evil that lay in waiting for her. No one could anticipate the darkness that swirled in the souls of those that murdered and violated her.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc4af41d26e880dfbfcde311ac3ab56bddaad2de/0_0_6493_3898/master/6493.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee540c9ddcf9afc37fdfd80e9230fe3d","title":"brazil flat earth conference terra plana","story":"A first-ever conference in São Paulo will mark a high point for a theory that has thrived under the far-right President BolsonaroSiddhartha Chaibub’s suspicions that the Earth wasn’t really round were first aroused when he stumbled across a YouTube video while living in Brazil’s capital, Brasília.“I was always very sceptical about things,” said the 35-year-old freelance designer, who soon ed deep into the flat Earth universe: reading, watching videos and joining a dedicated WhatsApp group.By the end of 2015, he was convinced. “The model that is imposed on us – that the Earth is spherical – is full of contradictions,” he said.Today, his YouTube channel Professor Terra Plana (Flat Earth Professor) – featuring videos such as “25 examples that prove Nasa is a fraud” and “gravity doesn’t exist” – has nearly 29,000 subscribers.Last week, Chaibub and three of his flat Earth fellows got their biggest break yet when they appeared on the country’s most-watched talkshow, The Night, to promote Brazil’s first ever flat Earth convention this Saturday in São Paulo.The location of the event will only be disclosed on the day, organizers say, for security reasons. “There is a lot of prejudice,” said ChaibubCritics attribute Brazil’s most recent flat Earth craze to poor public education, copycatting from abroad and to the increase in social media use.“The internet gives a voice to these idiots,” said Fernando Lang da Silveira, a professor of physics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil.He said that like climate change denial and creationism, flat Earth theory had a base of Christian fundamentalism.In Brazil, the power and influence of the evangelical Christian church has grown significantly in recent decades: around a quarter of the population identifies as evangelical and these voters played a large part in bringing the far-right president Jair Bolsonaro to power.Chaibub, who says he is a Catholic, admits that part of flat Earth culture is influenced by Bible verses, but denied that the movement is religious – or political.Accusations of links to the flat Earth movement have dogged Bolsonaro’s government.In January, the science minister, Marcos Pontes – South America’s first astronaut – said that he felt a “knot in the stomach” when he heard suggestions that the Earth is flat.But just a few months later, Olavo de Carvalho – a former astrologer who is considered the intellectual guru of Bolsonaro and his inner circle – prompted outrage and ridicule when he tweeted: “I didn’t study the subject of the flat Earth. I just watched a few videos of experiments that show that aquatic surfaces are flat – and so far I haven’t found anything to refute them.”Carvalho – who has also claimed the Pepsi was sweetened with aborted foetuses and that oral sex can cause cancer – dined with Bolsonaro and Steve Bannon in Washington during the Brazilian president’s state visit to the US in March.When questioned about flat Earthism, the foreign minister, Ernesto Araújo – an Olavo disciple who believes climate change is a Marxist plot – also seemed sympathetic to the movement, saying: “For me, the Earth is round. But it’s important to have this spirit of questioning,”Brazil abounds in folk legends, and has long been home to a thriving subculture of new-age truth-seekers and UFO-spotters.One of the country’s most popular authors, Paulo Coelho, claims to have had “experiences” with aliens “more than once” – although he recently clarified to the BBC that he knew the Earth wasn’t flat.Marcelo Gleiser, a Brazilian professor of physics and astronomy at Dartmouth College in the United States and winner of this year’s Templeton Prize, described the resurgence of the theory as “very sad”.“We’re living in very strange times. The idea of being popular for being outrageous is coming from the leadership,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fba22ecd1e40347a8844f1ec442dc04b1356d366/0_204_6130_3678/master/6130.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=071932a1927b8322f20e1f52ab3c5e12","title":"local tribe save amazon indigenous peruvians","story":"Alarmed by the impact of logging, indigenous Peruvians are using satellite mapping to manage their landThe first thing Ramón heard about the deal was the televisions. A number of families from the Asháninka indigenous group had received them from outsiders, in exchange for land. Loggers were interested in the mahogany, oak and tornillo trees that grow to impressive heights in this part of the rainforest around Cutivireni in central Peru.The loggers had other means of persuasion, besides bribery. They might offer to build a school or a meeting house in exchange for timber. When the work ran over budget, they would demand money – and since the Asháninka had none, they would take more trees to service the debt, according to Adelaida Bustamante, the community treasurer. And if that failed, they used violence. In 2014, four forest defenders from the Asháninka were murdered for their campaign to keep loggers off their land (Ramón asked me not to use his real name).Cool Earth, which also has projects in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Cambodia and Papua New Guinea, offers finance and training to indigenous communities to support them in protecting their areas of the forest. The charity sets up funding for community associations, on condition that the whole group decides how they will spend it (in this remote region, the money is mostly wanted for emergency healthcare). It also uses satellite maps to show locals the extent of forest clearance in their area, and the speed with which the rainforest is disappearing. “The most effective strategy to conserve the rainforest, in any part of the world, is to empower indigenous groups who are motivated in the same direction,” says Tony Juniper, former director of Friends of the Earth, Cool Earth ambassador and author of Rainforest. “It’s a tried-and-tested strategy in South America. It has worked in Brazil, Colombia and Peru: if you look at maps of the forest in those countries, you will see that the areas under indigenous control are best protected.”The Asháninka know all about external threats. For years they survived a terror onslaught from the Maoist Shining Path guerrillas, who targeted young men to join their ranks and occupied villages that then came under retaliatory fire from government forces. In the 1990s, after the guerrillas were defeated, narco-traffickers slipped into their place, offering a high price for remote land for cultivating coca. They restored an airstrip that missionaries had built in Cutivireni in the 1970s and used it to transport drugs and weapons.After the years of conflict, the Asháninka face a new threat. The greatest driver of deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon is now subsistence farming, and as the population grows in these more peaceful times, there is an urgent push to grow more food. A study published in May this year, by Princeton University, on bioersity loss in Peru, showed that in the western Amazon, smallholder “slash-and-burn” agriculture is the “primary driver of forest destruction”. The main method of farming among the Asháninka involves felling trees to make a clearing, creating space in the sunlight where their food crops can grow.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theIn 2016, wildfires caused a spike in deforestation rates in Cutivireni – fires that may have been started by burning to prepare the ground for planting.So part of the Cool Earth project involves giving local people the information they need to make their farming practices more efficient and less destructive. Director Matthew Owen says that while campaigns against industrial-style palm and soya plantations are working, the focus must now switch to smallholders’ agriculture, which is responsible for keeping deforestation emissions stubbornly high.“Figuring out how to support better lives while keeping the forest standing deserves some of the innovation billions that go to carbon storage and better batteries,” Owen says.This much is clear from observations on the ground. After a long walk through the cool of the Cutivireni forest, past towering tornillo trees and mashonastes with their great buttressed trunks, dangling orchids and tree ferns – suddenly, a clearing.It looks like the aftermath of a battle: trees slashed to the ground lying, some half-burned, where they fell.Between the trunks sprouted yuca plants, the staple foodstuff of this region, as well as bananas and sweet potatoes.“People in remote areas have an obsession with growing yuca,” says Aurora Lume, an agronomy graduate and member of Cool Earth’s field team who grew up in the region (her family had to flee their village when guerrillas moved in). “A family of three will clear a hectare of forest to plant this crop. But the soil only has a useful life of two years. After that, they will move on and clear another patch.” The agronomist is helping Asháninka people in this area to boost the productivity of their land for food crops. Cool Earth also pays a coffee technician to visit the villages and advise on how to improve the quality of their coffee and cacao yields – these could be a useful source of income. Coffee grows better in the shade, so a successful coffee business keeps the forest canopy intact.The Cool Earth team convened a meeting in the tiny settlement of Tankoari, before a crowd of about 50, including children, and the chief. As woodsmoke billowed, Bustamante gave the villagers a severe lecture about the new clearings we had walked through. There had to be better planning, she insisted, if they were to continue to receive funding.Lume then unfurled the instrument that will enable this planning: a large satellite map. The map showed the area across the Ene river almost entirely stripped of forest after a government-sanctioned land-grab by farmers from the Andes in the 1980s. On the Cutivireni side, the picture was more varied: dark brown patches showed dramatic forest clearance from 2016, mostly caused by fire, and pale patches indicated the areas where crops were growing.Analysts at Cool Earth made these maps from data produced from Landsat images by Matthew Hansen at the University of Maryland. Campaigners, NGOs and investigators increasingly use Hansen data to compile evidence of large-scale clearance by multinational companies. But satellite mapping is also proving a powerful way to demonstrate to local communities the effect of their farming methods.The villagers at Tankoari were impressed: they had not realised the bald patches were so numerous, or so close together.“The people were taken aback by what they saw,” Daylar Capaquia, a field officer with Cool Earth, told me later. The Asháninka territory runs eastwards almost to the border of the Otishi national park, more than 3,000 sq km of pristine forest, and they had a sense of the forest rolling on indefinitely. “Now the Asháninka are realising their situation and understanding how precarious their environment is,” says Capaquia. “The mapping exercise is a new beginning, there’s a transition under way.”The Cool Earth funding agreements are, in theory, conditional on keeping the trees standing. “There will be a challenge,” says Capaquia. “Once they’ve agreed where they can cut down trees to grow food, they must stick to that.”The challenge was uncomfortably apparent as the meeting continued against the rhythmic sound of axe against tree trunk, followed by the slow, tearing noise of a 100ft tree crashing to the ground.Before the satellite mapping project, the boundaries between what is protected and what is not were never clear. Jaime Peña, a conservationist and forest expert from Cutivireni and adviser to Cool Earth, has been monitoring incursions into pristine forest for more than a decade.“We were clearing areas to grow subsistence crops, without planning or oversight,” he says, shaking his head. “You can’t be too heavy handed, but people have to understand that if they continue to clear at the present rate, in 15-20 years, they will have no forest. Mapping is helping villages to plan how they use land. It is creating the groundwork for a new chapter.”In the areas where Cool Earth is working with communities, planning and managing cultivation has reduced forest loss by half. The power of community engagement is being taken more seriously: the Peruvian government launched the National Forest Conservation Programme (Programa Nacional de Conservación de Bosques) in 2010, rewarding communities who succeed in curbing deforestation and managing sustainable farming systems in their territory with annual payments and technical support. As reports show an increase in illegal mining in southern Peru, with devastating results, the forests of Cutivireni have a much better prospect of survival.Cool Earth covered the cost of Clare Longrigg’s travel to PeruThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

From tomorrow your  Morning Briefing will take on a different look as we expand our coverage of the UK election campaign. Make sure you are subscribed to have the latest election news hit your inbox bright and early each weekday.Boris Johnson is due to visit the Queen today and then formally announce that a general election will be held on 12 December. His Conservative party’s campaign has been forced on to the defensive after Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested those killed in the Grenfell Tower fire had lacked “common sense” in following fire service advice to stay put instead of fleeing. Rees-Mogg issued a “profound apology” but the Tory MP Andrew Bridgen compounded the anger of survivors and relatives by suggesting Rees-Mogg was “cleverer” than those who died. Meanwhile the Tories have been criticised for propagating fake news after releasing a misleadingly edited video in which Labour’s Keir Starmer is made to look like he can not answer a question about Brexit. Meanwhile Conservative plans to rubbish Labour’s spending plans using civil service costings have been scuppered after the head of the civil service decided that publishing the Treasury analysis only weeks before the election would be improper. This is understood to have enraged the chancellor, Sajid Javid, as it blows apart the Conservatives’ plan to open their election campaign by attacking Labour’s economic credibility.In a  exclusive, we can reveal that Conservative candidates have been instructed by party HQ not to sign pledges on the NHS, the environment or trade deals. But supporting shooting is allowed “as an important part of rural life”, says an internal document that sets out boilerplate replies to questions that candidates might face. A row continues to simmer over the report into Russian interference in UK politics: Marina Litvinenko, the widow of the murdered ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko, says Boris Johnson’s delay in publishing the report helps the Kremlin and feeds suspicions of a government “cover-up”.The Liberal Democrats’ leader, Jo Swinson, has been accused of not taking sufficient action against party activist Steve Wilson, who had to apologise after claiming the Labour MP Dawn Butler had made up her experience of racism in the Commons. The Green party launches its campaign today in what it hopes to frame as “the climate election”. The party will pledge to spend £100bn a year on the climate crisis, raising corporation tax and radically overhauling the tax system – all while stopping Brexit. Airport expansion would be stopped and HS2 scrapped and replaced with investment in rail electrification and local bus services. And Nigel Farage has visited leave-voting, Labour-held Bolsover – just the kind of seat he would like to steal for his Brexit party. But at least 20 of Farage’s purported 600 or so candidates have already quit.\u0026gt Gordon Sondland, Donald Trump’s ambassador to the EU, has changed his impeachment inquiry testimony to confirm the president made an “improper” demand that Ukraine investigate Joe Biden’s son in return for $400m in military aid.\u0026gt The British backpacker Grace Millane died of strangulation during a Tinder date, a New Zealand jury has been told. The prosecution in the murder trial says the accused, 27, whose name is suppressed, took photographs of Millane’s body, watched pornography, hired a carpet cleaning machine and searched online about fires in the bushland area where her body was later found buried in a suitcase he had bought. The accused man’s defence is that her death was a sex game gone wrong.\u0026gt The world’s people face “untold suffering due to the climate crisis” unless there are major transformations to global society, more than 11,000 scientists have warned in a joint statement. They urge an end to population growth, leaving fossil fuels in the ground, halting forest destruction and slashing meat eating.\u0026gt Government ads praising the Conservatives’ flagship universal credit have been banned as misleading. The advertising watchdog said they made unsubstantiated claims, including that people moved into work faster on universal credit and that jobcentres would pay an advance to people who need it. Aditya Chakrabortty writes this morning: “That campaign was paid for by taxpayers like you and me … Almost a quarter of million pounds was taken off us to lie to us.”\u0026gt This morning in our series on children in the justice system we discuss how vulnerable youngsters in care homes across the country are being bundled off to court for damaging residential facilities or assaulting staff – showing, says one prominent MP, that the system has failed.‘Alarming evidence’ – British universities are not adequately responding to the growing risk of China and other “autocracies” influencing academic freedom, the foreign affairs select committee has said. It highlighted the role of officials from China-funded Confucius Institutes in confiscating papers that mentioned Taiwan at an academic conference the use of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association as an instrument of political interference and evidence that one or more Uighur dissidents studying in the UK had been monitored, with family back in China being harassed. The committee says there is “alarming evidence” of meddling, some of which appears to be coordinated by the Chinese embassy in London.Fishing gear litters oceans – More than 640,000 tonnes of nets, lines, pots and traps used in commercial fishing are dumped, discarded or lost in the sea every year, the same weight as 55,000 double-decker buses. Greenpeace says the gear, which is deadly to marine life, makes up the majority of large plastic pollution in the oceans. About 300 sea turtles were found dead as a result of entanglement in “ghost gear” off the coast of Mexico last year, while in October a pregnant whale was found with fishing gear entangled inside its mouth. “The world’s governments must take action to protect our global oceans and hold the under-regulated fishing industry to account for its dangerous waste,” said Louisa Casson from Greenpeace UK. This should start with a strong global ocean treaty being agreed at the United Nations next year.”Tom Phillips joins the search for some of the thousands of people who have gone missing or been murdered in the country’s bloody drug wars.

They took 14-year-old Regina Herrmann out of class and told her the ruling Socialist Unity party considered her father an enemy of the state, a “capitalist exploiter”, because he ran his own business, a hairdressing salon. She would not be allowed to continue attending a school in the socialist one-party state, and could bury her dreams of becoming a doctor. In the coming months and years, Herrmann often had the feeling she was being followed. There were sudden rumours she was a Flittchen, an easy girl. At her father’s salon, men would make lewd comments or touch her inappropriately twice, someone tried to rape her.It was only after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 that Herrmann found in the Stasi archives documents instructing five unofficial collaborators to target her in bars and nightclubs: “It is well known,” the file said, that Herrmann “likes to dance and is happy for her dance partners to invite her to the bar afterwards.” In communist East Germany, systematic degradation of this kind by the Stasi – the draconian state police – resulted in lost careers and mental health issues. Herrmann, now 72, is one of thousands of victims of the GDR’s regime who have, until now, been denied access to long-promised support schemes. In reunified Germany, former employees of the Stasi draw generous public-sector pensions while many of their victims had their lives, careers and health ruined by its intrusions – while struggling to prove to authorities that things would have been very different if not for the police state’s oppression.Frank Lampard praised Chelsea’s spirit after they fought back from 4-1 down to claim a point against Ajax and keep alive their hopes of reaching the last 16 of the Champions League. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was among the fresh legs brought into the Liverpool side and he scored a delightful goal in a 2-1 win over Genk at Anfield as Jürgen Klopp’s side topped Group E. Granit Xhaka has been stripped of the Arsenal captaincy following his extraordinary fallout with a large section of the club’s fans, Unai Emery has confirmed.Saracens have blazed a trail across Europe but a salary-cap breach has stamped an asterisk on a great club and the game. Sonny Bill Williams will be unveiled as the highest-paid player in the history of either code of rugby next week after agreeing a two-year deal with Toronto Wolfpack. The Los Angeles Chargers owner, Dean Spanos, has denied reports his team are open to moving the NFL franchise to London. And England cannot play in the Olympic Games but their success at this year’s football Women’s World Cup means Team GB, coached by Phil Neville, will appear in Tokyo – a concept branded unsatisfactory by three of the four constituent parts.Jacob Rees-Mogg’s comments about Grenfell victims lacking “common sense” for not leaving the burning building are the lead in the : “Rees-Mogg condemned over remarks on Grenfell” and the i: “Rees-Mogg grounded by Tories”. The Sun has: “God save fur Queen”, with a report that the Queen has banned the use of fur on all her new outfits. Several newspapers use the story as an opportunity to run pictures of the Queen decked out in her finest furs. The news of a breakthrough DNA test for babies leads on the Mirror’s front: “Birth test revolution” and the Express: “DNA test at birth to save lives”.The FT has: “Javid furious as top civil servant blocks pricing of Labour pledges”, the Times reports: “China tries to gag UK universities” and the Mail says: “Rail union’s mass misery for millions”, with news that workers for South Western Railway will stage a 27-day strike over December and New Year’s – but it manages to make the story partisan, saying the strike comes from “Corbyn’s militant pals”.And the longest headline we have seen on any paper in some time features on today’s , which leads with a quote from Boris Johnson: “‘The tragedy of the modern Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn is that they detest the profit motive so viscerally … they point their fingers at iniduals with a relish and a vindictiveness not seen since Stalin persecuted the kulaks.’” Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

The exact level of the coffee cup levy is yet to be finalised, and will depend on “market research”, but it is expected to be either 10 cent, 15 cent or 25 cent It will apply to all single-use cups, including compostable cups. The environmental levies will be introduced in phases. As well as the levy on coffee cups and the increase in the plastic bag levy, the first phase will also see medium weight plastic bags – often sold as heavy duty bags – hit with the plastic bag levy for the first time. Other charges in the first phase, set to be completed by the end of 2021, include a €5 per tonne waste recovery levy that would apply to landfill, waste and export and an increase in the landfill levy from €75 per tonne to €80 per tonne. The second phase, completed by the end of 2023, will include levies on take-away containers. A third phase will see charges on retail food packaging, such as plastic used for baked goods, fruit and vegetables. Coffee shops will also be asked to display a range of prices: the cost of a coffee in a reusable cup the cost if a single-use cup is used and the cost of having a coffee on the premises using the coffee shop’s own cups.All money raised from such levies will be invested in environmental initiatives, such as programmes to tackle litter and waste.Mr Bruton said “a coffee cup levy has clear benefits for the environment”, noting that 22,000 disposable cups are used every hour."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4074115.1573027465!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"more water woes for greater dublin area","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish Water conceded anyone can ring up and inform the utility they believe themselves to be vulnerable to get access to bottled waterMore than half a million people who are waking up this morning will do so unable to consume water in their homes without boiling it first.You’ve reached an article that is only available to  subscribers.Subscribe today and get the full picture for just €1 for the first month."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Trial of man accused of murdering Grace Millane in 2018 begins in AucklandExperimental measure introduced as smog levels reach 20 times the WHO limitMore than 30 flights are erted from city airport due to poor visibility from smogSeveral people wounded one man is beaten with sticks by protestersCauseway Bay shopping area was clouded with tear gas prompting protesters to fleeUK police believe all 39 people found dead in back of truck in Essex were VietnameseFour-day closed-door plenum concluded in Beijing this weekFor every 100 cases, 31 reached court and only six resulted in a jail term, report findsTrial stopped after parents\u0026rsquo privacy concerns and fears device could be used to control the childrenNarendra Modi aims to stimulate economic growth after insurgency and 70,000 deathsBlaze breaks out after explosion of gas canister being used by passengers to cook breakfastMembers of Peacock Generation thangyat troupe arrested for jibes about militaryDisqualification of Joshua Wong (23) is likely to fuel anti-government protests furtherAttack happened as tourists were snorkelling in the popular Whitsunday PassageDemonstrators set fire to shops and hurled petrol bombs at police on Sunday, police respond with tear gas and rubber bulletsRiot police use water cannons and fire rubber bullets at demonstrators in hotel districtEvacuation affects areas already hit by two typhoons since last monthCross-border corridor rare act of co-operation between nuclear-powered rivalsIncumbents win five-year mandate in country deemed second least corrupt in AfricaIndigenous Australians watch tourists make last climbs after years of asking for closure"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4074113.1573025586!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"democrats claim election wins in kentucky and virginia","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRepublican Matt Bevin, who was narrowly defeated  by Democrat Andy Beshear in Kentucky. Photograph: Mandel NganAFPFile photoUS Democrats claimed an upset win in Kentucky on Tuesday over a Republican governor backed by president Donald Trump and seized control of the state legislature in Virginia, where anti-Trump sentiment in the suburbs remained a potent force.The outcomes of Tuesday’s elections in four states, including Mississippi and New Jersey, could offer clues to how next year’s presidential election could unfold, when Mr Trump will aim for a second four-year term.In Kentucky, Democratic attorney general Andy Beshear, whose father, Steve, was the state’s last Democratic governor, scored a narrow victory over governor Matt Bevin despite an election-eve rally headlined by Mr Trump.In a speech in Lexington, Kentucky, on Monday night, Mr Trump – who won Kentucky by 30 per cent in 2016 – told voters they needed to re-elect Mr Bevin, or else pundits would say the president “suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world”.The remarks reflected the extent to which Mr Bevin (52) sought to nationalise the campaign, emphasising his support for Mr Trump amid a Democratic-led impeachment inquiry of the Republican president in US Congress.While the result was a significant setback for Mr Trump, who remains relatively popular in Kentucky, it may have had more to do with Mr Bevin’s diminished standing in the state. Opinion polls showed Mr Bevin may be the least popular governor in the country, after he waged high-profile fights with labour unions and teachers.Mr Beshear’s upset win could also bolster Democrats’ slim hopes of ousting Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, who is on the ballot himself in the state next year.At a rally on Tuesday night, Mr Bevin refused to concede, citing unspecified “irregularities,” even as Mr Beshear called on the governor to honour the results.Mr Trump said on Twitter that his rally had helped Mr Bevin avoid a bigger loss and boasted that Republicans had won several other statewide races.“@MattBevin picked up at least 15 points in last days, but perhaps not enough (Fake News will blame Trump!),” the US president wrote.VirginiaMeanwhile, Democrats wrested both chambers of Virginia’s legislature from narrow Republican majorities, which would give the party complete control of the state government for the first time in a quarter of a century.Mr Trump has avoided Virginia, where Democrats found success in suburban swing districts in last year’s congressional elections, as they did in states across the country. Tuesday’s election, which saw Democrats prevail in several northern Virginia suburbs, suggested the trend was continuing.In Mississippi, where Republican Governor Phil Bryant was barred from running again due to term limits, Republican lieutenant governor Tate Reeves defeated attorney general Jim Hood, a moderate Democrat who favours gun rights and opposes abortion rights.Like Mr Bevin, Mr Reeves campaigned as a staunch Trump supporter in a state that Mr Trump easily won in 2016. The president held a campaign rally in the state last week alongside Mr Reeves.In New Jersey, Democrats were expected to maintain their majority in the state’s general assembly, the legislature’s lower chamber.The Virginia contest drew heavy attention and money from both parties. Former vice-president Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential front-runner, visited Virginia over the weekend to campaign with several statehouse candidates, and Republican vice-president Mike Pence held a rally on Saturday.Other Democratic presidential contenders, including US senators Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker, have also campaigned with local candidates.In one notable race, Democrat Shelly Simonds, who lost a state House of Delegates race in 2017 via random draw after the election ended in a tie, won a rematch against Republican David Yancey.Virginia’s Democratic gains came despite a year of scandal for the party’s top officials in the state. Governor Ralph Northam barely endured a political firestorm after his yearbook page was shown to have photos of someone in blackface and another person in a Ku Klux Klan costume, while attorney general Mark Herring admitted to wearing blackface himself in college.Lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax, meanwhile, has denied two accusations of sexual assault.The legislative wins likely mean that Democrats can pass a raft of Bills that Republicans had resisted, including new gun limits. Democrats will also control the redistricting process in 2021, when politicians draw new voting lines for state and congressional elections after next year’s US census.–Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons november 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.General Election 2019 poll tracker: Lead for Boris Johnson as campaign beginsComment: Macron in China: Can Gallic charm help EU make inroads with the Red Dragon?General Election latest news: And they\u0026#39re off!

It came less than a year after the pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto detailed the cryptocurrency in a paper titled \u0027Bitcoin: A peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\u002728 Bitcoin is used as a currency for the first timeOn 22 May, 2010, the first ever real-world bitcoin transaction took place.

The machine allowed people to exchange bitcoins for cash58 The fall of MtGoxThe world\u0027s biggest bitcoin exchange, MtGox, filed for bankruptcy in February 2014 after losing almost 750,000 of its customers bitcoins. At the time, this was around 7 per cent of all bitcoins and the market inevitably crashed68 Would the real Satoshi Nakamoto please stand upIn 2015, Australian police raided the home of Craig Wright after the entrepreneur claimed he was Satoshi Nakamoto. He later rescinded the claimOn 1 August, 2017, an unresolvable dispute within the bitcoin community saw the network split. The fork of bitcoin\u0027s underlying blockchain technology spawned a new cryptocurrency: Bitcoin cashTowards the end of 2017, the price of bitcoin surged to almost $20,000. This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearThis year bitcoin\u0027s price has risen steadily and it is currently trading at around $9,300, having briefly reached above $12,000 in June. It remains prone to sudden swings in price, which some attribute to market manipulation by so-called bitcoin whales that are able to influence the price through a single trade.A flash crash that wiped $1,000 from bitcoin\u0027s value in less than an hour was triggered by the sale of 5,000 bitcoins - worth around $40 million at the time of the trade.It remains a long way off its 2017 highs, though some market analysts believe its upward trajectory will likely continue in the long term.CoinMarketCap)Other cryptocurrency experts claim that despite the historical turmoil, bitcoin will continue to rise in price and could eventually recover to 2017 levels.Some advocates even believe bitcoin is still a long way from reaching its full price potential, with figures like John McAfee and Tim Draper arguing that its scarcity means it could grow more than 25-fold in value over the next few years.Russian nuclear scientist caught mining bitcoin in top-secret lab“$250,000 means that bitcoin would then have about a 5 per cent market share of the currency world and I think that may be understating the power of bitcoin,” Mr Draper said in September.Mr McAfee, who founded the eponymous antivirus firm, is even more bullish in his forecast, having recently stood by his notorious prediction\u0026nbspthat bitcoin would hit $1 million by the end of 2020.A website set up to track his prediction shows that it is currently more than 90 per cent behind being on track.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

avoiding the scrutiny of Parliament through the use of Statutory Instruments (SIs).Created with Sketch.These products may become more costly in the trade war Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Orange Juice, which Florida is known for, may soon be subject to import tariffsThe EU lists \u0027footwear with outer soles of rubber or of plastics and uppers of plastics\u0027 amongst the goods that may soon be subject to import tariffsCosmetic products, such as US brands Maybelline, MAC and Avon, may soon be subject to import tariffsGetty Images for Rebekka RuetzJeans, the all-American trousers, are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may be subject to import tariffsBourbon whiskey is on the EU\u0027s list of over 100 US products that may be subject to import tariffsUS peanut butter products are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may soon be subject to tariffsUS motorcycles, such as the Harley-Davidson, may soon be subject to import tariffsCranberry products, a major US crop export, may soon become more expensiveAll tobacco products are on the EU\u0027s list of US goods that may be subject to import tarifsOrange Juice, which Florida is known for, may soon be subject to import tariffsThe EU lists \u0027footwear with outer soles of rubber or of plastics and uppers of plastics\u0027 amongst the goods that may soon be subject to import tariffsCosmetic products, such as US brands Maybelline, MAC and Avon, may soon be subject to import tariffsGetty Images for Rebekka RuetzJeans, the all-American trousers, are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may be subject to import tariffsBourbon whiskey is on the EU\u0027s list of over 100 US products that may be subject to import tariffsUS peanut butter products are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may soon be subject to tariffsUS motorcycles, such as the Harley-Davidson, may soon be subject to import tariffsCranberry products, a major US crop export, may soon become more expensiveAll tobacco products are on the EU\u0027s list of US goods that may be subject to import tarifsSuch changes have the potential to “vastly increase devolution of food safety regulation”, according to the report, creating the prospect of trade barriers between England and Scotland or Wales.Dr Emily Lydgate, a senior environmental law lecturer at the University of Sussex and one of the authors of the study, said: “Food safety SIs are a potential flash-point for Scotland - which wants to maintain alignment with the EU - and Westminster, which promises to pursue a US trade deal that will alter UK food safety legislation.“Negotiating a US trade deal that Scotland opposes is certainly not viable and could even fuel a push for Scottish independence.“If one or more devolved administrations refuses to realign its food safety regulations from those of the EU to comply with US standards after a US-UK free trade agreement, it will complicate the flows of agricultural and food products within the UK.Boris Johnson is \u0027surrendering\u0027 to the chlorinated chicken“This raises the question of how the UK can avoid introducing internal UK regulatory controls and border checks to ensure that products comply with ergent jurisdictional requirements.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Actual output has come in above the level that polls have suggested.Nonetheless, the figures demonstrate the level of confidence among British businesses and\u0026nbspshow Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal has received only a “lukewarm” reception from British firms, said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.Services account for four-fifths of UK output and had, until recently, remained relatively\u0026nbspresilient in while construction and manufacturing contracted sharply.Brexiteers have got it so wrong on the slumping poundAmong the worst-hit sectors has been the car industry which has seen investment collapse since the 2016 EU referendum. New data released on Tuesday showed a further 6.7 per cent slump in the number of vehicles rolling off production lines in October.Some 10,348 fewer cars were registered in October than during the same month in 2018, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).The figure reflects a tough environment for businesses and consumers as economic and political uncertainty continue to hit confidence, the trade association said.The decline was driven by a 13.2 per cent drop in demand from private consumers. Sales of diesel models slumped 28.3 per cent, while petrol cars fell by 3.2 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Supreme Court will hear appeals over three days from two separate challenges to the prorogation of Parliament brought in England and ScotlandOfficials at the CBI added that output remained flat in the three months to October, and is expected to fall next quarter by 9 per cent.SMEs blamed the political and economic uncertainty abroad as the biggest reason for lacking optimism, followed by import licence restrictions.Jobs in the industry shrunk by 5 per cent\u0026nbspfor the first time since January 2013 and is expected to fall at a similar pace in the next quarter, it added.As a result of the uncertainty, companies said spending on plants and machinery were down 20 per cent, with staff training spends down 25 per cent.Alpesh Paleja, CBI Lead Economist, said: “As a first step to lifting the malaise, the next government must get behind business to deliver on a Brexit deal, particularly one that unlocks a smooth transition period.“Then the real heavy lifting can begin on forging a future relationship with our biggest trading partner. Ending political uncertainty will enable a renewed focus on domestic priorities, which is critical for the economy\u0027s longer-term growth.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

avoiding the scrutiny of Parliament through the use of Statutory Instruments (SIs).Created with Sketch.These products may become more costly in the trade war Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Orange Juice, which Florida is known for, may soon be subject to import tariffsThe EU lists \u0027footwear with outer soles of rubber or of plastics and uppers of plastics\u0027 amongst the goods that may soon be subject to import tariffsCosmetic products, such as US brands Maybelline, MAC and Avon, may soon be subject to import tariffsGetty Images for Rebekka RuetzJeans, the all-American trousers, are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may be subject to import tariffsBourbon whiskey is on the EU\u0027s list of over 100 US products that may be subject to import tariffsUS peanut butter products are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may soon be subject to tariffsUS motorcycles, such as the Harley-Davidson, may soon be subject to import tariffsCranberry products, a major US crop export, may soon become more expensiveAll tobacco products are on the EU\u0027s list of US goods that may be subject to import tarifsOrange Juice, which Florida is known for, may soon be subject to import tariffsThe EU lists \u0027footwear with outer soles of rubber or of plastics and uppers of plastics\u0027 amongst the goods that may soon be subject to import tariffsCosmetic products, such as US brands Maybelline, MAC and Avon, may soon be subject to import tariffsGetty Images for Rebekka RuetzJeans, the all-American trousers, are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may be subject to import tariffsBourbon whiskey is on the EU\u0027s list of over 100 US products that may be subject to import tariffsUS peanut butter products are on the EU\u0027s list of goods that may soon be subject to tariffsUS motorcycles, such as the Harley-Davidson, may soon be subject to import tariffsCranberry products, a major US crop export, may soon become more expensiveAll tobacco products are on the EU\u0027s list of US goods that may be subject to import tarifsSuch changes have the potential to “vastly increase devolution of food safety regulation”, according to the report, creating the prospect of trade barriers between England and Scotland or Wales.Dr Emily Lydgate, a senior environmental law lecturer at the University of Sussex and one of the authors of the study, said: “Food safety SIs are a potential flash-point for Scotland - which wants to maintain alignment with the EU - and Westminster, which promises to pursue a US trade deal that will alter UK food safety legislation.“Negotiating a US trade deal that Scotland opposes is certainly not viable and could even fuel a push for Scottish independence.“If one or more devolved administrations refuses to realign its food safety regulations from those of the EU to comply with US standards after a US-UK free trade agreement, it will complicate the flows of agricultural and food products within the UK.Boris Johnson is \u0027surrendering\u0027 to the chlorinated chicken“This raises the question of how the UK can avoid introducing internal UK regulatory controls and border checks to ensure that products comply with ergent jurisdictional requirements.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Actual output has come in above the level that polls have suggested.Nonetheless, the figures demonstrate the level of confidence among British businesses and\u0026nbspshow Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal has received only a “lukewarm” reception from British firms, said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.Services account for four-fifths of UK output and had, until recently, remained relatively\u0026nbspresilient in while construction and manufacturing contracted sharply.Brexiteers have got it so wrong on the slumping poundAmong the worst-hit sectors has been the car industry which has seen investment collapse since the 2016 EU referendum. New data released on Tuesday showed a further 6.7 per cent slump in the number of vehicles rolling off production lines in October.Some 10,348 fewer cars were registered in October than during the same month in 2018, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).The figure reflects a tough environment for businesses and consumers as economic and political uncertainty continue to hit confidence, the trade association said.The decline was driven by a 13.2 per cent drop in demand from private consumers. Sales of diesel models slumped 28.3 per cent, while petrol cars fell by 3.2 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Supreme Court will hear appeals over three days from two separate challenges to the prorogation of Parliament brought in England and ScotlandOfficials at the CBI added that output remained flat in the three months to October, and is expected to fall next quarter by 9 per cent.SMEs blamed the political and economic uncertainty abroad as the biggest reason for lacking optimism, followed by import licence restrictions.Jobs in the industry shrunk by 5 per cent\u0026nbspfor the first time since January 2013 and is expected to fall at a similar pace in the next quarter, it added.As a result of the uncertainty, companies said spending on plants and machinery were down 20 per cent, with staff training spends down 25 per cent.Alpesh Paleja, CBI Lead Economist, said: “As a first step to lifting the malaise, the next government must get behind business to deliver on a Brexit deal, particularly one that unlocks a smooth transition period.“Then the real heavy lifting can begin on forging a future relationship with our biggest trading partner. Ending political uncertainty will enable a renewed focus on domestic priorities, which is critical for the economy\u0027s longer-term growth.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Also on board: an oven for baking chocolate chip cookies, as well as samples of carbon fibre used by Italy\u0027s Lamborghini in its sports cars.Budweiser has already sent barley seeds to the station, with an eye to becoming the beverage of choice on Mars. In 2015, a Japanese company known for its whiskey and other alcoholic drinks sent up samples.

The portrait\u0027s small size – it measures 77 x 53 cm – can still be a surprise to those jostling for a glimpse of it, but it is the earliest Italian portrait to focus so closely on the sitter in a half-length portrait.230 Johannes Vermeer\u0027s Girl with a Pearl Earring (c.1665) at the Mauritshuis in The HagueAs she looks around with her slightly parted lips, you can’t help but wonder what this painting\u0027s sitter is about to say. There is an almost photorealist quality to this painting of an anonymous girl with a pearl earring – immortalised by Scarlett Johannson in the 2003 film. Vermeer, the Dutch Golden Age painter, died impoverished – he only painted two or three paintings a year because he worked so slowly, and the world forgot about his work until it was rediscovered in the 19th century.330 Peter Doig\u0027s Blotter (1993)  at Walker Art Gallery, LiverpoolThere is something so tranquil and magical about  Doig\u0027s paintings. This purple-hued work from a family snapshot is of his brother standing on a frozen pond and looking down into the reflection. Images reflected in water are common in his work – as seen in White Canoe (1991) and Echo Lake (2000) – and function as “entrances to other worlds.430 Sandro Botticelli\u0027s The Birth of Venus (1485-1486) at the Uffizi Gallery, FlorenceThe Renaissance painting is the highlight of the Uffizi in Florence for good reason – it\u0027s a triumphant celebration of female beauty. Venus, with her long flowing hair, has been blown by the gentle breeze onto the shore of Cyprus and balances on a giant scallop shell. A young woman, thought to be Hora of spring or one of the graces, holds out a cloak covered in flowers.  530 Michelangelo\u0027s Sistine Chapel ceiling (1508) in Vatican CityThis breathtaking sequence of scenes from the Book of Genesis covers the ceiling of one of the chapels in the Vatican, and includes Michelangelo\u0027s best known fresco of the Creation of Adam. The Italian Renaissance painter was commissioned to paint it in 1508 by Pope Julius 11 – he even designed his own scaffold to paint up so high.630 Gustav Klimt\u0027s The Kiss (1907-1908) at the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere, ViennaNothing can be as irresistibly romantic as Klimt’s oil painting, which shimmers with gold leaf and depicts two lovers entwined in a loving embrace. Both wear patterned robes which reference the contemporary style of Art Nouveau and the earlier Arts and Crafts movement. It is a departure from the artist’s usual portrayal of woman as the femme fatale.730 Claude Monet\u0027s Impression, Sunrise (1872) at The Musée Marmottan Monet, ParisIt is easy to get lost for hours in the calmness of Monet’s hazy scene of the port of Le Havre, with a rising red sun casting shadows onto small boats. When it was first shown in a group show in Paris in 1874, the painting that gave Impressionism its name was criticised for looking unfinished.830 Hokurai\u0027s The Great Wave (1829-1832) at The British Museum, LondonThere is something seductively dangerous about this enormous, claw-like wave, that is about to break and engulf three fishing boats off Kanagawa in Japan. The woodblock print is the first in the Japanese artist’s series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. It is one of the most famous Japanese artworks in the world. 930 Vincent van Gogh\u0027s The Starry Night (1889) at The Museum of Modern Art, New YorkVan Gogh painted this night sky from a view from his room at the Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Remy, France, where he was admitted for mental illness after cutting off his own ear. With its intense swirling patterns, van Gogh manages to conjure up a whirling vista above a sleepy village, with the crescent moon, stars, Venus and orbs.The Museum of Modern Art1030 Rembrandt van Rijn\u0027s The Night Watch (1642) at Rijksmuseum, AmsterdamThis militia painting threw formality out of the window with its sense of movement and action. Rembrandt even painted himself hidden in the scene, which depicts Captain Banning Cocq and 17 members of his civic militia guards – all of whom commissioned the painting. Rembrandt puts a spotlight on the main characters with his trademark use of light and shadow, including a woman carrying a chicken.1130 Theodore Gericault\u0027s The Raft of the Medusa (1818-1819) at The Louvre, ParisThis lifesize painting, which measures about 16 feet by 23.5 feet, almost takes you with it on its doomed journey. The then-27-year-old Gericault drew inspiration from a real tragedy of men aboard a French naval frigate in 1816. Only 10 of the 150 men who boarded the raft lived. It is regarded as an icon of Romanticism for its emotive composition and interest in the natural world.1230 Tracey Emin\u0027s I Could Feel You (2014) at Tate Britain, LondonThe Young British Artist is better known for her installations such as My Bed (1998) but it is no surprise that her paintings also hint at being candidly autobiographical in her examination of the female body. This is one of six related works on paper, each with a sensual title (Just Waiting, Stay Up, All for You), which is painted in black gouache. 1330 Mt St Victoire, Cezanne (c.1895) at Princeton University Art Museum, New JerseyPost-Impressionist painter Cezanne, with his bold, flat use of colour, painted the mountains in southern France overlooking his hometown Aix-en-Provence many times. His new ways of depicting perspective by simplifying objects to planes and geometric shapes was a big influence on the later Cubists, especially Picasso, who called him “my only master”. Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection1430 Pablo Picasso\u0027s Les Demoiselles d\u0027Avignon (1907) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkPicasso used geometric forms to portray the female body in this striking painting of five nude sex workers in a brothel in Barcelona. His new style kick-started Cubism, a movement that he and Georges Braque invented and which resulted in abstract and fragmented paintings. 1530 Marcel Duchamp\u0027s The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (1915-1923) at Philadelphia Museum of Art, PhiladelphiaDuchamp’s bizarre artwork, that he declared as “permanently unfinished”, is meant to evoke the erotic tension between the bride and the bachelors. Known as The Large Glass, as it is over nine feet, it comrpises two shattered glass panels suspended vertically, which contain a mechanical-like bride, a large shape that references the Milky Way, nine bachelors in geometric shapes and mechanical objects, all painted in oil to give it colour. 1630 Andy warhol\u0027s Campbell\u0027s Soup Cans (1962), Andy Warhol at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkThis artwork, which consisted of 32 canvases, each painted with a Campbell soup can in different flavour, helped to introduce pop art as a major art movement in the US. It led to many more works depicting Campbell Soup cans over his career – ones with torn labels or opened lids, many being produced at The Factory, where studio assistants created them for him.  1730 Bosch\u0027s The Garden of Earthy Delights (1503-1515) at Museo del Prado, Madrid The central panel of this extraordinary triptych oil painting on oak panel shows a manic utopia of male and female nudes cavorting with wild abandon, often with animals. The left panel shows Christ blessing Eve before she is presented to Adam while the right panel illustrates Hell. It is likely this work, by the Danish artist Bosch, is a warning against lust. 1830 Jasper Johns\u0027s Flag (1954-1955) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkThe American artist dreamt he painted a large American flag and got on with it promptly the next morning. Now it is the painting for which he is best known, painted over strips of newspaper visible beneath the see-through paint, locating the painting in the McCarthy era and at the beginning of the Cold War. 1930 Damien Hirst\u0027s Anthraquinone-1-Diazonium Chloride (1994) at Tate Liverpool This famous example of a Spot Painting – rows of randomly coloured circles – was produced by Hirst’s assistants. The artist produced about 60 Spot Paintings a year from 1986 to 2011. For Hirst, who is reportedly now the UK\u0027s richest living artist, they were just “a way of pinning down the joy of colour”. 2030 Salvador Dal\u0027s The Persistence of Memory (1931) at the Museum of Modern Art, New YorkTime and space have a hallucinatory quality in this instantly recognisable surrealist painting of melting watches. The human face, visible on an abstract form, with its long eyelashes, represents Dali. This painting was fuelled by the artist\u0027s interest in the dream analysis of Sigmund Freud, and made him a star at the age of 28. 2130 Lucien Freud\u0027s Girl with a White Dog(1951) at Tate, LondonFreud was known for his psychologically complex figurative portraits, and this painting of his first wife Kitty Garman, who was pregnant at the time of the sitting, is no exception. The artist manages to reveal a multitude of emotions in the composition. He painted her many times during their short marriage, which ended in orce in 1952, due to his many infidelities. 2230 Edvard Munch\u0027s The Scream (1893) at The National Museum, Oslo from 2020This painting came about when Munch was overcome by fear and anxiety during a walk with two friends, and “the sky suddenly turned to red”. The location was in earshot of his sister’s lunatic asylum, but it is said to capture the universal anxiety of modern man. It is currently waiting to be rehoused in the new National Museum in Oslo.2330 John Henry Fuseli\u0027s The Nightmare  (1781) at Detroit Institute of Art, Michigan This sexually charged painting of a woman lying across a bed, as a demonic creature crouches on her chest, has been an icon of horror, ever since it was first exhibited at the annual RA exhibition in 1782. Is she having a nightmare? Is it referencing Fuseli’s own love life? Or is it about female desire?  The artwork created shock and intrigue in its day and made Fuseli famous. Detroit Institute of Arts2430 Bridget Riley\u0027s Nataraja (1993) at Tate Modern, London When Bridget Riley first created her black and white abstract paintings in the 1960s – known as op art – the images seemed to actually move. The brightly coloured diagonal stripes in this later painting, inspired by a trip to India, also creates a sense of movement. She created it on paper in gouache, before handing it over to her studio assistants, to transfer it onto canvas. 2530 Jackson Pollock\u0027s Autumn Rhythm (Number 30) (1950) at the politan Museum of Art, New YorkPollock had already created his first drip painting in 1947, sending shockwaves through the art world. The technique, which involved painting on a canvas laid flat on the floor and pouring, dripping, even splattering paint onto it – with a degree of control – is at its peak in Autumn Rhythm, which is evocative of nature. He died in a car crash aged 44 in 1956. 2630 Édouard Manet\u0027s Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe (1862) at the Musee d’Orsay, ParisThis painting caused a scandal when it was first exhibited in Paris in 1863. The scene of a naked woman having a picnic with two fully clothed men is still jarring. But in Manet’s day, female nudes usually represented figures from mythology, like goddesses. This painting, which places the nude in an everyday setting, was a departure point for Modern Art as Manet refused to toe the line.2730 Frida Kahlo\u0027s Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird (1940) at Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas, AustinThe Mexican surrealist artist found painting self-portraits therapeutic. This one reveals her suffering her long lasting pain after a bus accident her infertility her orce from artist Diego Rivera and the end of her affair with photographer Nikolas Muray. Bursting with symbolism from Mexican folklore, it is a jigsaw puzzle of meaning. 2830 Diego Velázquez\u0027s Las Meninas (1656) at Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid, SpainThe leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age captures himself working on a large canvas in this realistic portrayal of the Spanish court, where he was court painter. The young princess Infanta Margarita Theresa is surrounded by servants, while her parents King Philip 1V of Spain and Mariana of Austria, watch the scene from a doorway. It holds plenty of mystery as to the relationship between the viewer and the characters depicted. For example, does the mirror reflect the hidden picture on the easel? 2930 Henri Matisse\u0027s Conversation (1908-1912) at the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg What are they talking about? It looks serious. Matisse’s oil painting depicts the artist and his wife Amelie in conversation against an intense sapphire blue colour. Matisse wears striped pyjamas, which were fashionable as leisurewear in 20th century France. It was painted in his country house, and there is a tension in the way his wife sits – understandable, given that he reportedly once told her that he loved painting more than her.3030 Sir John Everett Millais\u0027s Ophelia (1851-1852) at Tate Britain, LondonA drowning Ophelia from Shakespeare’s Hamlet is slowly sinking into the stream. The Pre-Raphaelite artist recreated, with breathtaking attention to detail, the consequence of Hamlet’s murder of her father. His 19-year old model, Lizzie Siddal, nearly died of a cold from lying in a bath fully clothed for hours, long after oil lamps used to keep the bath water warm went out. The artist did not notice but ended up paying her doctor’s bills.130 Leonardo da Vinci\u0027s Mona Lisa (c.1503) at The Louvre, ParisIt\u0027s the mysteriously serene smile of this painting\u0027s subject – thought to be Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a Florentine fabric merchant – that has given it universal fame.

The Supreme Court will hear appeals over three days from two separate challenges to the prorogation of Parliament brought in England and Scotland“They can’t hide the truth that if people are being forced in ever-increasing numbers to turn to food banks to survive, the social security system is not protecting people from poverty as it should.”The advert also promoted “advance payments”, failing to explain that these were a loan and came with conditions attached.“The reality is that advances are loans that need to be paid back, often on top of other debts and rent arrears built up during the five-week wait, leaving many people at risk of destitution,” Ms Greenwood added.The ASA received 44 complaints in total, which alleged that six separate adverts\u0026nbsppublished in the\u0026nbsp in the space of several weeks, and a webpage advertised on the\u0026nbspMailOnline and  website, were misleading, not obviously identifiable as marketing or could not be substantiated.DWP advised claimants to search for ‘striptease artist’ rolesDWP gives private companies £630m for more disability benefit testsTwo-thirds of young single parents to lose out under universal creditThe trauma inflicted by universal credit will not be easy to eraseThree of the four allegations, which related to the veracity of claims made within the adverts, were upheld and the other partially upheld, in that the webpage advert was not sufficiently signposted as marketing.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When the problem first came to light last autumn,\u0026nbspthen-work and pensions secretary Esther McVey told the independent MP Frank Field that he should\u0026nbsp“tell these ladies that now we’ve got record job vacancies – 830,000 – and perhaps there are other jobs on offer”.The ASA ruling was confirmation the DWP cannot easily gloss over the realities of universal credit, said the Trussell Trust’s chief executive, Emma Revie.“What we need now, as the country heads into an election, is a pledge from politicians on all sides to protect people from hunger by making sure everyone has enough money for the basics,” said Ms\u0026nbspRevie.\u0026nbsp“We must start working towards a future where no one needs a food bank by ending the five-week wait for universal credit, ensuring benefit payments cover the cost of living\u0026nbspand investing in local emergency support for people in crisis.”\u0026nbspA DWP spokesperson said: “We are disappointed with this decision and have responded to the Advertising Standards Authority.“We consulted at length with the ASA as we created the adverts, which have explained to hundreds of thousands of people how universal credit is helping more than 2.5 million people across the country.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Nobody can be sure how this Battle for Britain will pan out, any more than in .Tory election manager Isaac Levido told staff this week: “There is a steep and narrow path to victory.”Another aide says: “It is unknowable. This is fraught with danger.”Polls are all over the place, some showing an easily blown Tory lead of six per cent — less than Theresa May’s before she lost her majority.Momentum Labour has made a flying start with social media, bombarding targeted voters with eye-catching and wildly misleading messages — just as it did so successfully in .“You would think the Tory machine might have learned from that debacle, but they haven’t,” says an insider. “And you can’t build a new system overnight from scratch.”The challenge for the Tories is to define the battle lines within the first two weeks.“If it is a choice between Boris and Brexit or a second referendum — or even a third referendum — we are in a good place,” says an insider.But with five parties in this fight — the Tories, Labour, Lib Dems, Brexit Party and SNP — lines rapidly blur.Tory rebels such as Phil Hammond can also wreak havoc by standing as independents.Even Boris’s own ,-majority Uxbridge marginal is under threat from a bizarre invasion of Extinction Rebellion and Stop HS protesters.Nigel Farage, stung by Boris’s successful EU deal, has stunningly over-reached, threatening to field  Brexit Party candidates — although he won’t risk standing himself.His wrecking ball move has backfired among old allies including Leave campaign partner Arron Banks and one-time Ukip MP Douglas Carswell.His own party chiefs are in revolt, with Farage under pressure to back down fast.Cash donors have begun deserting and pro-Brexiteers are voting with their feet.One Sun reader, Brian Pearsall — a “paid-up Brexit Party supporter” — tells me: “I will be backing Boris. Mr Farage is beginning to annoy me. If he wants us to get out he should put candidates only in seats where the Tories have no chance of winning. What the hell’s got into him ”Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has also misjudged the national mood by junking Brexit altogether — and campaigning to rejoin the EU.Her party has slipped in the polls and she is offering pacts to a ragbag of Greens, Plaid Cymru and any other minority group who might offer a hand.Yet every vote picked up by Swinson and Farage in Tory target marginals opens the door to a Labour advance.The stakes in this General Election have never been higher — or clearer. More than million adults voted in  to leave the European Union.Unless they have changed their minds, this is their last chance of seeing that wish come true.No more ritual humiliation of humble MPs who incur his wrath or ministers who dare challenge his petty tyranny.Parliament will take a while to recover its ­dignity after a torrid ten-year political trauma.

Evenwe can argue about the “weather” bit.Two contestants, though, go straight into the all-time Apprentice Hall Of Fame, alongside the greats like Paul Torrisi and Stuart Baggs.First is Cockney barrow boy Thomas Skinner, who sticks out among the boys like Ray Winstone in a touring production of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert, and has turned out to be a lot more likeable than I was expecting.The second, though, most certainly hasn’t. For she is Lottie Lion, the librarian and wine snob who’s given to quoting Shakespeare: “For though she is but little she is a massive pain in the a**e.” Or words to that effect.All your worst office nightmares rolled into one, this girl. An undermining, ­passive-aggressive crawler who can swivel on a sixpence, depending on which way Lord Sugar’s wind is blowing.“In business there is no room for ­gambling.” “Hang on. Business is a gamble. You don’t take risks, you get nowhere.” “Yes, risk-taking is important, Lord Sugar.”Lottie’s also not helped by the fact she’s often right and most certainly wasn’t to blame for the failure of the scavenger hunt task which disintegrated, in ­shameful fashion, right at the start when team Empower’s Pamela Laird asked: “Does anyone know when the Second World War started ” Silence. They didn’t know when it started, ­finished, or even what side was responsible for killing Biggie and Tupac.A media meltdown followed, yet, amid the general despair, no one bothered to thank The Apprentice for the public ­service of flagging up this ignorance, because that’s not what happens with this show. Instead, it gets accused of stuff.This year, inevitably, it’s been called racist and claims have been made that the first four candidates were sacked due to their skin colour, rather than the fact they were completely useless or ­produced a “bespoke ­corporate ­lollipop” that looked more like a vibrator.It’s only Twitter that’s saying these things, of course, but they need to be quashed as the BBC is actually dumb enough to listen to these imbeciles and forget Sugar’s first winner was Tim Campbell and his show is about the only place on the network where black and minority ethnic people will be treated entirely on their merits.Get rid of The Apprentice and, I guarantee you, its ­precious and entertaining hours will be filled with the same mollycoddling, box-ticking, ­condescending, right-on ­b*****ks that fills most of the rest of the Beeb’s output.Treasure this show while you still can .The One Show, Matt Baker: “I’m very much looking forward to talking about your play, Meera [Syal].”The X Factor: Celebrity, Louis Walsh to Jenny Ryan: “Very few people can sing Shirley Bassey but you nailed every single note.”With a Black  Decker staple gun and no anaesthetic.ONLY two places there’s ever likely to be a demand for Vinnie Jones to sing Lip Up Fatty, by Bad Manners.One of them is Piers Morgan’s Hollywood wake.Thankfully, that’s probably still a good  or  months away.So I’ll stick with the other, X Factor: Celebrity, where we were already several horrors into the night when Martin Bashir’s brain developed technical issues, just as he was about to assault the second verse of EasyLike Sunday Morning.“I’ve forgotten the words . . .“A wah wah-waaah wanna be freeeee.“I do apologise.”Not necessary, Martin.Vinnie’s manic can-can took the initial sting out of things a couple of turns later.And, when it came to the climax, Simon Cowell dodged his decision and the public voted-off Jonny Labey and Victoria Ekanoye instead of a startled Bashir, who gasped: “What has happened ”You stayed silent. They sang. Go figure.Seven Worlds, One Planet cutting and pasting that horrendous old footage of the sky-ing walruses.A BBC continuity woman deciding His Dark Materials is our “new Sunday night obsession”. .The slyly partisan One Show featuring a film with Corbynista Ken Loach calling for “real change”, on the day the election was called.And arch-luvvie David Tennant describing the responsibility of murdering one Proclaimers song for Children In Need: Got It Covered as: “A bit like National Service.”For you or the viewers, David THE guessing games begin as soon as the opening credits for BBC’s big new Sunday night drama kick in and reveal it’s set in a parallel universe.A place where relationships between humans and their animal soul-mates are unusually close.Swindon “Oxford.”Oooh, close, but no cigar at the start of His Dark Materials, an epic, eight-part adaptation of author Philip Pullman’s trilogy that’ll probably go down well with anyone who’s read the books and loves fantasy adventure.Unfortunately, I haven’t read the books and hate fantasy adventure.My loss, I realise. It means I draw an emotional blank with the show’s incredible production valuesand even Ruth Wilson’s fabulous performance as Mrs Coulter.Initial stumbling block is the fact everyone’s trailed around by their own soul in animal form, Daemons who can all talk but never once stop to take a dump or cock their leg against the scenery.Teenage heroine Lyra has a shape-shting weasel thing called Pantalaimon, James “Asriel” McAvoy’s got Stelmaria the snow leopard and John Torode’s got a hairless gastropod called Gregg. But that’s another show, I think.On this one, there’s also the all-powerful Magisterium, giving everyone the creeps, and the uncharted north’s mysterious city in the sky, which James McAvoy is getting quite excited about.The detail that finished off His Dark Materials for me, though, was the news that arrived just before the climax of episode one.“Roger’s been taken by the Gobblers.”As the late, great Eric Morecambe once said, there really is no answer to that.Would it be fair to assume the BBC’s bisexual Dracula bats for both sides BBC’s darkly funny Guilt, with Mark Bonnar and Jamie Sives.The nightmarish, bird-eating Iranian viper footage on Seven Worlds One Planet.Lee Mack pretending to be Anneka Rice’s nude le model on the outstanding Would I Lie To You .C’s brilliant Celebrity Hunted climaxing with the question: “Is Gavin Henson really stupid enough to go back to his own house ” .And best ever breakfast TV host, Piers Morgan, marking his eagerly awaitedto Good Morning Britain by identying singer Ruby Turner as the rhyming slang for curry, “Ruby Murray”.Food food food, Piers.Clinton Morrison: “I think Mesut Ozil had a prove to point.”Jeff Stelling: “For United this is a matter of extreme danger with a capital X.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Piglet and Eeyore are companions of which fictional bear ”Matt: “Donkey.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Pemberton Place in Atlanta is named after the inventor of what soft drink ”Glynis: “Orange.”Bradley Walsh: “Which cabinet designer ­published a book of his own designs in  ”Vivien: “Mr Ikea.”And Bradley Walsh: “Dingoes are said to have been introduced to Australia by whom ”Kirsten: “The Kennel Club.”SO what’s it like in the non-stop Mardi Gras of ­EastEnders at the moment Callum: “I’ve been thinking of taking an ­embalming course.”CHILDREN In Need: Got It Covered.My ears: Got ’em covered.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in the meantime, it’s important to take whatever diabetes medication helps you to manage your blood sugar levels properly to prevent long term complications.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You wanted a child who looked more like you.But rubbishing the suggestion Mrs Mander replied: I do not look white and I do not look Hispanic. We were advised not to tick every box, we did not mind what ethnicity the child was, we were willing to offer any child a loving home. All the correspondence felt like it was the colour of my skin which was why we were rejected.”The court heard Adoption Berkshires gatekeeper Ms Loades single-handedly rejected the Manders adoption application. She told the court she deferred the application indefinitely because the couple wanted a young under-three years old, simple needs child.Ms Loades claimed the council had a lot of older vulnerable children who needed placing for adoption so she told Mr and Mrs Manders to come back another time.The court was told social worker Shirley Popat visited the couple’s five-bed home in Maidenhead to assess them. But in a  phone call she “confirmed she would not accept our application due to our cultural heritage and our only other option was to adopt from India or Pakistan, Mrs Mander said.Recalling a phone conversation between her husband and the social worker, Mrs Mander added: I could hear from his voice that something wasn’t right.I heard something about cultural heritage,” a smartly-dressed Mrs Mander told the court. I felt that I should have the same right to enter the process as anyone .”Katherine Foster, defending, told the couple: “You are now determined to attribute racism to these social workers. You interpreted it as being racist when it was not.”Ms Foster conceded Mr Mander, the Vice President of an IT company, had dismissed the issue of race in a meeting. She said: “On April  Shirley Popat visited your home and your husband emphasised that you both have pale skin and touched his arm to show that point.The Manders claim direct discrimination on the grounds of race, in breach of Section  of the Equality Act  and the European Convention on Human Rights.The pair say they should not have been rejected from even joining the approved adopters register because of where their parents were born.

Presenter Susanna Reid asked the Shadow Cabinet minister five times how Labour would campaign in a second referendum.Unable to give a straight answer, he blustered: “Well, in a sense, what I campaign for is secondary because what we are saying is that it is for the country to decide.  We’re saying less power to politicians, that’s where we have been struck for the last ½ years.”Ms Reid asked him againLabour wanted Britain to leave the EU or remain. An almost incoherent Sir Keir muttered: “The Labour party says we are going to put this choice, before you.”He also revealed that while he will be in charge of Labour’s bid to renegotiate Brexit, he has already ruled out voting for the deal in a second referendum. Instead he wants Britain to Remain. But challenged on this bizarre stance, the rattled frontbencher said: “That is missing the point.”Sir Keir went on to say the EU’s Customs Union would have to be “reconfigured” because it only allows Member States to set the negotiating mandates for free trade agreements .Labour wants to rip up the rules so the UK can negotiate FTAs “in conjunction” with the bloc. But EU diplomats warned there was “not much” the bloc could do to involve Britain in shaping its trade policy other than drawing up a “consultation” role.And in a major blow to Mr Corbyn’s election hopes, outgoing Brussels boss Jean-Claude Juncker last night panned Labour’s vision. Speaking about Mr Corbyn’s plan to negotiate a new deal with the EU and then put it to a second referendum, Mr Juncker told the BBC: “Honestly spoken, I don’t think that this is a realistic approach.”But the Labour boss defended the policy, insisting his party can negotiate a brand new agreement with the EU in less than three months.He said: “Keir and I have spent many, many hours in Brussels and other European capitals. We wouldn’t be saying thiswe didn’t think it was realistic and do-able.”But Mr Juncker wasn’t the only senior EU official to dismiss the idea. One senior source said Mr Corbyn’s strategy was “not credible” and “delusional”.Another admitted that rewriting the PM’s deal to include a closer relationship would be “easy” to achieve within three months, but added: “Less straightforward is what the UK may ask on EU trade policy.”KEIR STARMER: You get a referendum...you get the choice between the best deal that can be secured...or Remain.SR: And what are you going to campaign for in that second referendum KS: What I campaign for is secondary...SR: Hang on, hang on, I need to know what you believe in  Do you think we should leave or remain KS: The Labour party says we are going to put this choice, before you.SR: But I am voting for you...Do you want to leave or remain KS: The Labour party says we are going to put this choice, before you. I’ve said many times what my personal position is.SR: You want to remain.KS: The Labour party says we are going to put this choice, before you. But that is missing the point.SR: So I am voting to stay in the EU...Are we leaving or remaining KS: The Labour party says we are going to put this choice, before you. We are going to, within six months, have a referendum and we are going to say here is the best deal that can be secured and it is going to go up against Remain and we are going to let the public decide.SR: It will be such a good deal that you yourself will vote against it KS: Well we are duty bound to get the best deal…SR: But how can it be a really good dealyou are going to vote against it After Sir Keir’s sloppy interview, he and Mr Corbyn travelled to the swing seat of Harlow, Essex, to insist Labour’s contorted Brexit position was in fact “very simple”.But Mr Corbyn refused to rule out reversing the EU referendum result altogetherthat helps him get the keys to No.He said: “All I can say is we are campaigning to win this election with a majority Labour government. We are not campaigning to form a coalition with anybody. We’re campaigning to go into office to carry out our manesto and that’s exactly what we’re going to be doing for the next five weeks in this election campaign.”Lib Dem boss Jo Swinson has already “ruled out” a deal to put Mr Corbyn in Downing Street. But former Labour MP Chuka Umunna — now a Lib Dem — hinted a back-room arrangement may be possibleLabour ditches its leader.He added: “The two main parties in their current configuration are not fit for purpose.”“The Labour Party can’t deliver that change and are a vote for the opposite — more delay and uncertainty. They won’t rule out revoking Article  altogether and want unlimited immigration, which would put pressure on our NHS.”In another stump speech, Mr Corbyn will insist the December  election is not about him, as he sets out his stall to be PM. He will tell an audience in Telford, Shrops, he aims to be “the kind of Prime Minister who only seeks power in order to share power — because it isn’t about me, it’s about all of us”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yet the way Ahmed’s case has been pumped up as a great cause celebre for women is frankly ridiculous.The real scandal is not that a highly paid female BBC presenter has been paid less than a male one. It is that the BBC is lavishing such fat pay on any of them while pleading poverty and ending free TV licences for people over .Ahmed’s case for equal pay is very weak. It is based on the argument that presenting Newswatch — which holds BBC’s news programmes to account — is of equal value to presenting Vine’s old show, Points Of View, which invited comments from the public on a wide iety of BBC programmes.The BBC claims the disparity is down to the fact that Points Of View is classied as entertainment while Newswatch comes under news.  Surely a more direct comparison would be between what Ahmed is paid and what her male predecessor, Raymond Snoddy, was paid.She received the same as he did. How is that gender discrimination   But while the BBC might have a strong defence in Ahmed’s case, it doesn’t endear the corporation to me.Every time the BBC Charter comes up for renewal, it poses as a terribly worthy public ­service broadcaster putting out serious, educational programmes no commercial broadcaster would touch.Unless the Government allows it to jack up the licence fee, it argues, it will mean no more David Attenborough, no more news correspondents in Mogadishu.Then, as soon as the BBC Charter is renewed, it goes back to pumping out the same old entertainment shows, many of them indistinguishable from commercial TV.A genuine public service broadcaster would not pay Gary Lineker £.million a year, Graham Norton £,or Huw Edwards £,.Compared with the fattest of BBC fat cats, Samira Ahmed might well feel undervalued. Yet earning £ for presenting a -minute programme would be a dream for many TV licence-payers, many of whom do not even earn that amount of money in a week.The BBC is merciless in its efforts to collect what is really a tax on TV ownership. Unlike other unpaid utility bills, failing to buy a TV licence is a criminal offence, leading to low-paid people struggling with finances being dragged through the courts.Last year, , people were prosecuted for non-payment. By the way,  per cent of them were women — possibly because they were more likely to be at home during the day when TV licence enforcement officers tend to call. That is the real gender unfairness, not highly paid female BBC presenters receiving less money than male presenters.Ahmed’s case has highlighted the old boys’ world from which the BBC hires its presenters.  Vine, she claims, was “gted” his Radio  show without any proper recruitment process. BBC management then allowed his agent to jack up his salary.The BBC seems to see itself as immune from the pay restraint where in the public sector. When David Cameron became Prime Minister, he said any public body would need an extremely good excuse to pay anyone more than the £, a year he then earned.Yet the BBC’s accounts for   show it paid  “on-air talent” salaries in excess of this figure.  While there have been token reductions for some male ­presenters, such as the now- retired John Humphrys, many have seen salary increases.High pay doesn’t end with the presenters. There were also  BBC managers and executives who were paid more than the PM last year.  If the BBC wants to justy the TV licence, it needs to be cutting excessive pay among its board and ­presenters.If it wants to be a commercial station, on the other hand, it should give up the licence fee and find funding from subscriptions and ­advertising.  Then it wouldn’t be our business how much its executives and presenters were paid because their salaries would come out of the pockets only of people who chose to subscribe to its programmes.This is particularly important now, in the week that both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have vowed to sort out the threat of over-s losing their licence fee exemption.As it becomes an urgent election issue, the worst look for the BBC is to be seen throwing money at presenters rather than the people it needs most — its loyal viewers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That would put us at greater risk.“The Americans would be very wary indeed about having the same broad confidence in intelligence sharing.”The concerns stem from Corbyns perceived support for anti-West states and his opposition to Trident.Back in April, Corbyn was branded a danger to Britain after signalling he would scrap Trident in a car-crash interview with Andrew Marr.Corbyn went against his party’s official position by saying he was not sure a promise to renew Trident nukes would be in Labour’s election manesto.Several former defence chiefs, Labour cabinet ministers and high-ranking diplomats have since expressed their concerns over Labour moving to  Downing Street.The former defence secretary Lord Hutton of Furness confirmed that a Corbyn premiership would “place a major question mark over the continued operation of a vital source of intelligence.”He said: “It’s impossible to look at it with anything other than extreme alarm.His views on Nato, his anti-Americanism, his failure to support any single British military expedition since he came into parliament, his opposition to nuclear weapons and his support for Putin’s Russia — his world view is completely at odds with every postwar Labour leader.”Whitehall sources have also claimed that Labour leader’s director of strategy Seamus Milne could be banned from seeing the most sensitive intelligenceCorbyn wins the election.It comes as Corbyn suffered a major blow as Brussels blasted his “delusional” plan to renegotiate Boris Johnson’s deal and secure a say over EU trade talks.EU officials and diplomats told The Sun that Labour’s bid to rip up the rules of the Customs Union so the UK can negotiate FTAs “in conjunction” with the bloc would meet fierce opposition.But one EU source warned: “Less straightforward is what the UK may ask on EU trade policy. The first thing would be a UK request for an extension, with a justication for that.”Another added that Corbyn’s strategy was “not credible” and “as delusional” as Boris Johnson’s pledge to negotiate a trade deal before the end of December ."},{"url":null,"title":"one in twenty british adults never retire","story":"And one in  of those who believe retirement is on the cards reckon they’ll be aged  or older when the time comes.But not all employees want to hang up their hat, as  per cent say they wouldn’t be able to afford to stop working and  per cent claim they would be bored.One quarter of adults would like to keep their brain sharp, and  per cent feel work gives them a sense of purpose, according to a study of , office workers.Other popular reasons for wanting to continue the nine to five include enjoying colleagues’ company and conversation every day, and getting a rewarding feeling from their work.The thought of spending all day with their partner, having to watch daytime TV and paying more for heating bills are other reasons Brits want to remain employed.Geoffrey Dennis, chief executive of SPANA, which provides free veterinary treatment to working animals in developing countries, said: “Most adults in the UK would like to retire early.But many people feel they’ll be working for many more years than they’d hoped – perhaps well into their seventies, or beyond.“However, it’s clear many people also get a real sense of satisfaction going to work, as it gives them a reason to get up in the morning and a sense of purpose.Some  per cent of employees are convinced they’d feel oldthey retired, and  per cent want to keep going as it keeps their body healthy.One in  adults are proud of their position at work, while  per cent enjoy the structure of their day and eight per cent enjoy the socialising that comes with being part of a business.The study found  per cent intend to carry on working for as long as they are able to.And  per cent believethey stopped their current career they’d probably always have a part-time job or continue to work on an ad hoc basis.Only three in  adults say they’re likely to give up work suddenly, with most assuming they’ll make the transition from full time worker to retiree over a longer period of time.And although many cite money as being the factor that will have the biggest impact on when they retire ,  per cent are likely to be led by the state of their health.Others say they’ll make their decision about retirement age based on availability of work, new ambitions or general happiness levels.But to retire comfortably, most people feel they would need a pension pot of some £, for things to be manageable, and almost eight in  worry they’ll never have enough money to stop working.For those who believe retirement is a possibility, more than half of adults are looking forward to having more spare time and  per cent will welcome a stress-free lestyle.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They then took a picture of the notice and tweeted it with the hashtag #Torystory.These are some of the harrowing stories:      Waiting three years for an autism diagnosis A while ago, I realised that I matched a lot of the characteristics for austism I went to the GP and explained this, and talked about how this means I find work much more dficult, contributes to my mental health problems and causes issues in my relationshops. I was put on a waiting list to be seen by a specialist. The waiting list was three years long. I, and many other autistic adults, cant get the support we need due to Tory cuts.    Waiting eight months for mental health treatment In March I was suicidal. I was referred for CBT. Iaposm still waiting. Mental health services have been neglected for too long.  I spent the night on a trolley in a store cupboard The Tories are destroying the NHS. I was admitted to hospital with a suspected heart attack. All the beds in the hospital were full I spent the night on a trolley in a store cupboard, with no windows, sink or even an emergency call button.

The Toriesapos chairman has been monstered on ITVaposs Good Morning Britain for releasing a doctored video - of someone, er, being aposmonsteredapos on ITVaposs Good Morning Britain.James Cleverly was savaged by host Piers Morgan for cynically editing footage of Labour on the previous dayaposs edition of the breakfast TV show.In a car crash interview, Mr Cleverly spent more than  minutes trying to pretend a fake news lie of Keir Starmer talking about Brexit was not doctored, when it clearly was to anyone who has eyes.In the end he tried to shut down host Piers Morgan and leave for a dferent interview - as he said exasperated: For goodness sake Piers, let me finish!    Well, the person the Tories didnapost let finish was Mr Starmer. Yesterdayaposs original GMB interview saw Piers Morgan ask the Shadow Brexit Secretary why he thought the EU would give Labour a good deal,there was a risk theyaposd campaign against it in a second referendum. The doctored video, viewed well over a million times, inserted several seconds of video showing Sir Keiraposs face in silence - apparently after the question. But in reality, Sir Keir immediately replied: Well, Piers, I have been talking to the EU, to political leaders across the EU  countries for the last three years, and I know very well what the parameters are of any deal they would do with a Labour government. We actually explored some of it in the cross-party talks that we were in with the government six months or so ago.  So I know that a customs union and single market alignment, and protection of workersapos rights and environmental rights and consumer rights is something that can be negotiated. Mr Cleverly was also slammed over the video by the BBC today, where Radio  host Nick Robinson told him: You put something out deliberately to mislead. But by far the most scathing criticism was from Piers Morgan - who said James Cleverlyaposs shameless refusal to accept the video was doctored was staggering. You seem completely unconcerned, he raged at the Tory HQ chief. The Conservative Party website, the official one, posted a fake video, that had a fake moment that never happened, on TV. If youaposre prepared to do that on day one of a campaign, why should we believe any video or anything that you guys put up    James Cleverly insisted: The official Conservative Campaign HQ Twitter account put out your video.What we did is because we wanted to make sure the video was short and punchy we had to take out an awful lot of the waffle. Mr Cleverly neglected to mention that CCHQ only shared the full interview after criticism about its doctored version. He did answer the question. You may not like the answer! Piers Morgan told him. You changed the video... Itaposs misleading and itaposs a lie! Even a Tory candidate apologised last night after sharing the video.    Johnny Mercer said: It would appear this has inexplicably been doctored at the end. I apologise and will remove it. The original interview was bad enough. Piers Morgan said: Johnny Mercer, who retweeted the fake one, has now put a grovelling apology out on his Twitter account for putting out basically a lie. And Iaposm staggered frankly that youaposre not prepared to sit here - youaposve always struck me as an honourable, straight talker - how can you defend this  Itaposs fake news! Mr Morgan added he was talking a load of flannel and defending fake news. Yet Mr Cleverly continued to defend the fake video in a cringeworthy exchange.

Mr Rees-Mogg “profoundly” apologised for suggesting Grenfell victims should have used common sense and ignored fire service guidance not to leave the burning tower block. Mr Rees-Mogg’s apology came after an LBC appearance on Monday, during which the Commons leader had discussed London Fire Brigadeapossaposstay-putapos policy and said: If you just ignore what youaposre told and leave you are so much safer. I thinkeither of us were in a fire, whatever the fire brigade said, we would leave the burning building. It just seems the common sense thing to do, and it is such a tragedy that that didnapost happen. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen defended the Commons leaderaposs comments, suggesting he would have made a better decision than the authority figures who gave that advice.    And he said: We want very clever people running the country, donapost we  He told BBC Radio ’s PM programme: He is an extremely intelligent and compassionate human being and his comments regarding Grenfell were uncharacteristically clumsy but we have to put them into the context of Jacob. Jacob is a leader, he is an authority figure and what he has failed to realise is that in a le-threatening and stressful situation most people, most of the public, will probably defer to the advice of an authority figure – be that someone from the fire authority or the police – and not come to their own conclusions. As we know with regard to Grenfell, that advice was flawed. Host Evan Davies told Mr Bridgen people had taken issue with the suggestion that Mr Rees-Mogg would not have died because he was cleverer than the people who took the fire brigadeaposs advice, Mr Bridgen said: But we want very clever people running the country, don’t we, Evan  That is a by-product of what Jacob is and that is why he is in a position of authority. What he’s actually saying is that he would have given a better decision than the authority figures who gave that advice.   Labour MP David Lammy called on Mr Rees-Mogg to resign.He said: “I’m disgusted, shocked. I’m thinking about those poor people who lost their lives, including my friend Khadija. When you look through the report, it’s clear that many of them stayed put because they were advised to do so. To describe them as lacking common sense is not just insensitive, it’s unforgiveable. These are people who had been complaining - about the building, the renovation, the conditions they were living in. It’s clear that there was flammable cladding. We find out that there were firemen who could have knocked on doors, who didn’t. All the rest of it. And they lacked common sense  It’s such a sort of arrogant and superior point of view: ‘those poor people in council houses’  Of course he should resign. It’s a scandal.”“Today you see what people like Jacob Rees-Mogg really think. And they basically think it was their fault. And I think that’s just ugly, and slightly sinister really. And time and time again, what lies under the surface is very dferent to what’s being said.”"},{"url":null,"title":"boy 4 traumatised after seeing","story":"NewsBoy, , traumatised after seeing naughty boy stab teen in back at fireworks displayThe family were on their way to a fireworks display in St Helens when they came across the bloodbath.

Local flooding is also possible more widely across the Midlands, East Anglia and the north of England. Properties may flood and there may be travel disruption.  It will be a chilly start for many this morning, with temperatures of C in central England and even lower in parts of Scotland. The mercury is not expected to climb above C and will dip down to C in the north this evening. Tonight will be cloudy with patchy rain in the evening for many, especially central and western areas. However it will be dry for a time in northern Scotland and south-east England.

By accusing the tower block’s residents of lacking common sense, the Cabinet minister betrays his contempt for the public. Another such moment is an outraged rape victim demanding the resignation of Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns. A leaked email has contradicted the senior Tory’s claim he didn’t know about a Conservative candidate – his former aide – causing the trial of her alleged rapist to collapse. The backlash against Tories who care little for little people leaves Boris Johnson, a PM out of touch himself, looking more cynical than ever with his endless  Brexit promises. Rees-Mogg’s callousness wasn’t just about Grenfell.  It exposed an arrogant Conservative Party mindset, sneering at ordinary folk and blaming them for the effects of the Tories’ own ideology of deregulation and austerity. Labour’s demand for real change looks more compelling than ever.

After all, they are what makes our games alive.“We, and other gaming studios, invest a lot of time and energy into this topic and it’s only fair to share our knowledge with the next generation of developers.”Abertay University is ranked number one in Europe for video games design degrees and leads the £. million Dundee-based InGAME partnership, which is part of the Arts and Humanities Research Council’s creative industries clusters programme and counts Beano Studios among its partners.InGAME director Sean Taylor of said: “We are delighted to be supporting this important project which has the potential to have a positive impact across the UK games industry.”Mike Stirling, head of Beano Studios, said: “We designed Beano and the games there to be totally safe for kids.“It’s an online destination that parents can trust.”"},{"url":"//www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/11/KCes_Old_Police_Station_Fintry_Road_Dundee_04.11.19-2.jpg ","title":"bookies on fintry road could be converted into new fish and chip shop","story":"A former cop shop could be transformed from a bookies into a chippy.The old police station building on Fintry Road is currently a Betfred bookmaker.But now the city council has received a planning application to convert it into a fish and chip shop.Dundee architect Peter Inglis tabled the plans on behalf of Seafield Estates and confirmed that the business behind the move already has fish and chip shops around the city.He said: “The operator thinks the shop will employ five or six people working on ious shts.“I am not at liberty to say who the operator is, but it is based in and around Dundee with  employees.“The fit-out of the unit is relatively easy as there’s nothing structurally inside to change, but obviously they will have to install new kitchen equipment.“There is nothing dficult about the fit-out, although the shop won’t be open for Christmas.“It has still to go through planning to obtain permission.“And there is a council policy issue with the site being within  metres of a house.“However, the proposal includes the installation of a very sophisticated extraction system so that nearby homes are not affected.“Hopefully the council will see the s the applicant is going to for this.”Mr Inglis added: “Historically, we tried for a chip shop three years ago and the operator still wants to put a chip shop on that site.“But I don’t know anything about last year’s bid for a shop and I cannot give any details.“I wasn’t the architect back then.”A year ago, architect Mark Walker submitted an application on behalf of Seafield Estates for a non-food shop unit next to the Betfred outlet.At that time the council insisted on the proposed new shop being painted blue in keeping with the colours of Betfred to maintain the general look of the area."},{"url":"//www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/11/5dc154d7eb90f1.99571514-565x564.jpg ","title":"dens boss mcpake wants players to put their stamp on dundee derby on friday","story":"James McPake has urged his Dundee side to put their “stamp” on Friday night’s derby crunch at Dens Park from the first whistle.The Dark Blues host their city neighbours Dundee United aiming to cut their rivals’ six-point lead over them at the top of the Championship table.In the stands there will no doubt be a feeling of putting things right going into the second derby of the season after the first ended with a humiliating - thumping at Tannadice .James, however, insists that defeat will have no bearing on Friday’s contest for his team.He said: “We will look back on that game just as we wouldwe were playing Alloa or Morton.“We look back on the matches we have played against our opponents and analyse them – looking at strengths and weaknesses.“We can’t say that we should have had the goal that was chalked off because that’s irrelevant now. You can’t say: ‘Don’t worry about it boys, we can just turn up and we’ll get the right calls this time’.“You need to put your stamp on the match and hurt whoever you are playing. They will be thinking the same. The talk will not be about that game. It will be about this match and what it means to us as a club.”The Dens gaffer is in no doubt his side are a “stronger group” this time around.And he points to the quality that’s been added since in the shape of former West Brom, Norwich and Rangers midfielder Graham Dorrans.“I would say we are a stronger group,” James said.“We have added quality to the group. However, United will be stronger, too, because, although they didn’t make wholesale changes, they have been able to work with their players and they have been on a good run.“I think the benefits we have had on the training ground they will have had as well.“They may not have needed as much work but we felt we did need to put in the work on the training field in terms of how we go about things.“I think you can see that and, hopefully, you will see it on Friday night again.”He added: “I still don’t think we are completely there.“I don’t knowI will ever think that. In terms of training and that, then yes.“The international break came at a good time for us because we hadn’t yet had the chance to integrate Graham Dorrans into the squad.“We also had Jamie Ness coming back so it was a really good time to get a week’s training done.“Then we have had the games coming in thick and fast and you can see the benefit of that week.“The boys have been getting to know each other and what’s good and their strengths.“It is tough to just tell them that, you need to work on it day in, day out on the training field. I think even the top teams will tell you that.“Getting a settled squad after the window shut and being able to work with the boys – that has certainly helped us.”Meanwhile, the Dens boss is hopeful left-back Jordan Marshall will be fit to start on Friday after he limped off early in the - win over Morton last week.James said: “He is OK, I think. We left him out of training yesterday but he is gradually getting better. Hopefully, we caught it at the right time.“He did look a bit tired the other night, as did some others. We are asking Jordan and the others to press hard in the game but, hopefully, he will be all right.“The fans have taken to him and I can see why. He is very consistent and has a good end product as well which goes under-rated at times.“We will get him through this week and he will be fine.”A string of wins has seen Dundee rise to third in the table, behind Morton and league leaders United."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/09e74cd2-95b4-4ae6-b1d9-2f3e6b1feccb-240x180.jpg

before an accident at work changed his le in .Fast-forward four years – and the former road worker contemplates taking his own le every single day.A visibly distressed Scott today revealed he has dealt with a tumultuous few years that have transformed his le.The death of his sister Jennie Cameron was among a number of family losses in a short period of time.Her brave battle against cancer was documented in the Eveningbefore she died on the day she was due to be married in September .Scott was admitted to Carseview the following month after attempting to take his own le.Now the former St Saviour’s High pupil is urging for greater aftercare support for those struggling with mental health issues.He said: “Since I had an accident at work it has sort of spiralled from there.“From being a man who used to work to support his family to being like this is incredibly hard to take.“I was in Carseview on two separate occasions the month that I attempted to take my own le.“I still have suicidal thoughts daily.”His fiancée, Cheryl, had to become his carer as the family attempted to rebuild their le in Brechin.An unfortunate brush with the law had seen Scott appear in court earlier this year.The police found a haul of antique knives in his car on Fairbairn Street.Dundee Sherf Court heard Scott was encouraged to start collecting knives by his mental health nurses when he was staying at the Carseview Centre.Scott added: “I had just bought the antique knives that day.“It was a case of wrong place, wrong time, after dropping off a family friend.“That pending court case didn’t help with my on-going issues.”Scott had hoped with the support of the community mental health team he could get his le back on track in Angus.He admitted a lack of regular support had seen his progress “stall”.He added: “Whether its a lack of funding or overworked staff, I believe there are failings in the system.“I know of others who are in a similar position to me who feel they can’t get the help they need.“There are massive gaps in the system.”Scott said he wanted to tell his story so that people could be more aware that mental health issues “don’t just go away”.He added: “Despite leaving Carseview my mental health issues didn’t stop the day I left that door.“It is an ongoing struggle and you need those support measures in place.“I want to get the help to turn this around.“Although we have things like Mental Health Awareness Week I believe there is still a lack of understanding of the struggles people face.”A spokeswoman for Angus Health and Social Care Partnership said, “Multidisciplinary community mental health teams are available in every town in Angus.These teams include nurses, doctors, social workers, psychologists and allied health professionals.“Community Mental Health Teams also commission third sector services to deliver care in the home and the community

cosgrove","story":"Buoyed by his first competitive Aberdeen goal, Curtis Main is confident he can forge a lethal strike partnership with Sam Cosgrove.Summer signing Main admits to frustration at both his lack of goaland game time since moving to Pittodrie.Chances have been limited and he was also hit by setbacks such as the dismissal last month against Hibs which he maintains was not a red card.Aberdeen opted not to appeal that sending-off and any momentum Main hoped to build was subsequently derailed by a two-game ban.However, the -year-old was given another opportunity when pitched in alongside prolic striker Cosgrove in a -- against Kilmarnock.It paid off as Main ended his competitive scoring drought and Cosgrove hit his th goal of the season.Main reckons they can become a dangerous duo in attack.He said: “I have no doubt Sam and myself can play together.“We showed against Kilmarnock there were spells in the game when we linked up really well.“I think everyone will be pleased with how we played attacking wise.“It is nice to play up there with another striker and you can build a relationship and work off each other’s game.“We are both imposing players but both link up well on the floor. It is not just one-dimensional.”His goalscoring performance against Kilmarnock was only the fourth start for the former Motherwell striker this season.Dons boss Derek McInnes has understandably opted to primarily use prolic striker Cosgrove to lead his attack.Cosgrove scored  times last season and is already closing in on that landmark again.Main said: “Absolutely, I have been frustrated. I just want to be on the park, playing minutes and scoring goals.“That is what I came here to do.“Behind the scenes I am working as hard as possible every day to put myself in a good position so that when the opportunities do come I am able to take them.“I have just had to keep my head down, work hard and wait for opportunities.“A few weeks ago I felt good in that gamebut unfortunately that didn’t go to plan.“I had to stay patient, stay ready and stay fit.“I am more than confident in my own ability. It is just about being on the park and showing everyone what I can do.”Main admits he has had discussions with manager McInnes about his lack of game time since signing on at Pittodrie.He said: “The manager is open and honest and I have had conversations with him through the season so far.“It is a competitive squad and it is about putting myself in a position to be in the squad and be in the team.”McInnes handed Main the opportunity to impress in the - draw with Hibs in his last appearance for the Dons on October .His strong performance was derailed when referee Don Robertson handed Main a straight red for a challenge on Stevie Mallan in the th minute.Main was shocked by the decision then and the red still rankles.He said: “It was disbelief. Absolute disbelief. I still maintain it was a good tackle. I think the boy made way too much of it.“I might have grazed his foot but there were a couple of incidents in the game where he was rolling round, which is totally unnecessary.“Unfortunately that is sometimes the way the game is played.“It was disheartening because I was in the team and had an opportunity. I felt I was playing well but I just had to forget it, put it to the back of my mind and wait for the next opportunity.“Thankfully that has come around very quickly and I managed to do something with it.”Main netted in the - pre-season friendly draw with Inverness Caley Thistle in July as part of the build-up to the Europa League campaign.He was delighted to finally score in a competitive match for Aberdeen and hopes it will be a catalyst for many more.He said: “ It was overdue and I am pleased that I have that goal.“Now I just have to move on and try to build on that.”"},{"url":"//www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/11/SNS-19607994-Aberdeen-v-Kilmarnock.jpg ","title":"mcinnes hails dons for bouncing back","story":"Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes today praised his under-pressure squad for bouncing back from their Celtic humiliation.The Reds were slaughtered by supporters and critics for the recent - loss where all Celtic’s goals came in the first half.McInnes demanded an immediate reaction and set a target of maximum points from the remaining three games before the international break.Aberdeen have delivered six with back-to-back wins against Hamilton and Kilmarnock.They travel to Ross County on Saturday before the Premiership goes into a week’s shutdown for the Euro  qualiers.McInnes said: “There was a bit of scrutiny on us after Celtic and I think the players have done extremely well to win both games with both clean sheets.“It is just a start for us and hopefully we can go on and get a third win in a row against Ross County next week. And go into the international break feeling a bit better about ourselves.”McInnes opted to partner strikers Sam Cosgrove and Curtis Main in a -- system against a Kilmarnock side struggling to field recognised centre-backs due to injury and suspension.It paid off with Main netting his first competitive goal for the Dons since his summer move.Cosgrove also scored to take his tally for the season to  goals.McInnes believes the score-line should have been more emphatic as Aberdeen were denied a penalty claim by referee Kevin Clancy.Cosgrove was brought down by a clumsy tackle from Stephen Hendrie in the box in the second half but the whistler waved play on.McInnes said: “We should have had a penalty with Cosgrove in the second half when he got wiped out in the bottom corner.“We also hit the post so it was good to get the third goal to add a bit of polish to the result.“Kilmarnock don’t normally lose too many goals so I am pleased with that scoreline against them.”The international break will give McInnes and his first-team squad the time to move into the new £ million training facility at Kingsford.Although the youth academy officially moved into Cormack Park yesterday, the first team squad have delayed it.Following the official opening by Sir Alex Ferguson on Thursday, they used the facilities for the first time the following day.McInnes said: “Cormack Park is a huge step forward for the club. It is brilliant facility for us all to enjoy.“We trained there on Friday with the team and it was the first chance the players had really got to see it.“We will train there again on Friday because we are not moving in full-time yet.“The academy kids and coaches started there on Monday and we will move in the following week.”Cormack Park is phase one of a £m plus development at Kingsford with phase two the delivery of a ,-capacity stadium.That was initially scheduled to be opened in summer  but that date is likely to be moved back a year until summer .McInnes said: “The players getting that first sense of Cormack Park and enjoying our own environment is fantastic for the professional side of the club.“However, it is great for the whole region. For the development of our players and coaches it is going to be a godsend.“It is what we should have had as we have been way behind other clubs in facilities.“Now we have a facility to be rightly proud of.”"},{"url":"//www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/iStock-879180126-140x74.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"inclusive basketball session to take place in aberdeen","story":"An inclusive basketball festival for young people is scheduled to take place in Aberdeen this week.Premium club and registered charity Grampian Flyers will host the event, which is aimed at both primary and secondary school pupils, on Friday.It introduces youngsters to both running and wheelchair basketball and is inclusive for pupils in schools with physical, sensory or intellectual impairments.They will have the opportunity to try out a range of dferent basketball drills, friendly competitive matches, inclusive zone basketball and take part in the sport for wheelchair users.It runs from am until noon at the Beach Leisure Centre in Aberdeen on Friday.For more information on the event, and to register a school to take part, contact kirsty.smith@gmail"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.48133168-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.48133168-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.48133168-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/11/2.48133168-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"north east road remains shut after river bursts its banks","story":"Parts of the north-east were hit by flooding causing road closures across the region and a river to burst its banks.The Scottish Environment Protection Agencyissued a flood alert ahead of yesterday’s heavy downpour.The Met Office said two inches of rain fell in around  hours which is almost half of the average rainfall for November.The B Kintore to Hatton of Fintray road, near Kintore Golf Club, was closed in both directions due to water flooding the surface and the River Don burst its banks at Inverurie.Aberdeenshire Council was also forced to close the Glassel Road with motorists being asked to find alternative routes.mdash Aberdeenshire RoadsNovember , A spokesman for the police advised motorists to take care while driving on saturated roads.He said: “If your vehicle loses grip, or “aquaplanes” on surface water, take your foot off the accelerator to slow down.

His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert! How is it that I had never even heard of that curious little bay. There it lay, calm and silvery, like a scene from a theatre. A striking and beautul spot.#In the modern era, many thousands of tourists visit Tarbert each year. Since the beginning of , more than , visitors have been recorded as accessing the Tarbert Castle site.Tarbert Harbour Authority manages one of the largest marinas in the Clyde area. Around  resident berth holders and more than , visiting leisure craft during the sailing season add considerably to the numbers who arrive at Tarbert and appreciate the attractive surroundings.The present plans for the power line, however, as exhibited by SSEN, will present a view on entering the harbour despoiled by a line of monster pylons.The current proposal suggests that four or five of the -foot pylons will dominate the western skyline. The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s. Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

In addition to HIE’s contribution will be an award of £, from the Rural Tourism Infrastructure Fund, with the balance from IGHT.It is expected that the modern site will strengthen the local economy by an additional £, a year and that other businesses on Gigha will benefit from the increase in footfall and visitor spend.The Isle of Gigha camp and motorhome site is due to welcome its first visitors in autumn , after which it will be open throughout the year.Strategic planning to secure a strong, sustainable future for the Mount Stuart Trust and the Isle of Bute is at an advanced stage, with key decisions expected by spring .Speaking ahead of the next phase of community consultations, Colin Boag, managing director of Mount Stuart Trust, said: #We are working intensively with community groups, Argyll and Bute Council and the Scottish Land Commission to develop a range of initiatives to improve the rural and urban landscapes on the island of Bute and to unlock growth opportunities for the local economy.#There is a great sense of purpose and commitment from everyone involved. This is matched by a desire to make progress on a number of crucial projects. The trust will conclude a strategic review by the end of the year. In conducting this - year ‘look forward’, we have been well supported through discussions with iniduals and community bodies across the island.#As part of the overall review, we are creating a specic rural strategy focussed on building a sound, sustainable future for farming and forestry on the island. Following an initial consultation with key stakeholders in July, we are developing the rural strategy through a number of joint working groups. These are examining key priorities including dairy farming, rural training and skills, forestry development and the environment.#Our emerging rural strategy builds on work completed with Argyll and Bute Council to support their bid to the Scottish and UK governments for a multi-million-pound Rural Growth Deal. Working together with the council, Fyne Futures and the Bute Island Alliance, we drew up a proposal for investment of £million to pilot on Bute a new transformative rural development model for niche food and drink and primary island industries.The trust is also consulting with local communities about the proposals to release urban land for community projects. This important work is being conducted in line with the Scottish Land Commission’s protocol on community engagement.In August, Mount Stuart Trust, with Scottish Land Commission representatives, held an urban community workshop with key community organisations in Rothesay. Discussion centred on how potential community projects could utilise land in Rothesay, which is currently in either council or trust ownership.Colin Boag added: #Throughout the discussions with ious community representatives, a number of local groups have expressed interest to make use of some or all of the land on offer. We welcome their interest in creating opportunities for positive change on the Isle of Bute.#I am confident that the depth of collaboration between Argyll and Bute Council, the Land Commission, local communities and the trust is set bring a strong sense of renewal and confidence to the island.#It was a trip to the Co-op and trollies at the ready for Lochgilphead High School pupils, as they were set a mission in aid of the Argyll Foodbank.Staff from the school ided the group of S pupils into teams, giving each an inidual budget to stick to. The senior students were then tasked with spending their money on Halloween treats that would later be donated to the local foodbank at Kilmory.Funds for the shopping trip were raised by a staff pumpkin carving session. Pumpkins, grown by the school#s science department, have been purchased by staff in preparation for the carving event that will take place next week. The money raised from this was then matched by school funds to give an overall budget of £.Over  items were purchased by the pupils on Thursday October , using their Young Scot cards to benefit from a  per cent discount and remembering to collect valuable points on their Co-op membership cards.The school has decided to make contributions to the food bank throughout the year, particularly focusing on Easter, Halloween and Christmas."},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries november 1 2019","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNumbers drawn in Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery on Monday October  were ,  and .

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"cairndows getting connected by community effort","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe end is almost in sight for a path connecting Cairndow around the head of Loch Fyne.Phase one of the path project # between the Tree Shop at Clachan and Achadunan # is already complete, but the much longer stretch between Achadunan and Cairndow village is currently being built, high above the A trunk road.Contractors have been employed to do the bulk of the work, thanks to grant funding, but  volunteers have been involved in what has become a real community effort.When complete, the five foot wide path, with a firm surface suitable for walking or cycling, will feature  bridges crossing burns and will have a specially designed crossing at the A above Cairndow village.The project, part of the Cairndow Action Plan, is on track for completion by the end of the year."},{"url":null,"title":"mod success stories from across argyll","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEight-year-old Emma Litster from Lochgilphead competed in the Highland dancing competition on Thursday October , held at the at the Gaelic College.

Sheeran.\"Tommys new EP, Golden Arrow, was released in April via Wow and Flutter Records.Therersquos a lot of contrast and colour throughout the tracks but the music lives in the same world as his first EP, Restless Love, thanks to Grammy award-winning producer, Sam Okell.Sam knew instinctively when to leave a track stripped back simply using Tommyrsquos pure vocal, acoustic guitar rhythms and a few atmospheric touches, and when to bring in much bolder production.The new EP has won support and plaudits galore from the tastemaker press such as Record Of The Day, When The Horn Blows and Celebmix, as well as Fearne Cotton, BBC Radio , BBC Scotland and ious Spoty editorial playlists.Clash Magazine hit the nail on the head when it praised Tommyrsquos wonderfully fresh songwriting which glistens with energy while searching towards something personal.Now based in London, Tommy Ashby s to his roots in the Borders on Saturday, November  to headline the String Jam Club.Allie added: \"We

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

Despite signicant effort over the last  months, it has not been possible to conclude the sale of the Campbeltown Creamery.When it became clear that a sale to a third party was unlikely, the local Kintyre farmers launched a plan to take over the creamery. Despite considerable work to find a way to take the business forward, especially from their steering group, advisers, the Scottish Government and staff at Campbeltown Creamery, they have not been able to find a financially viable long-term business plan for the creamery.Commenting on the announcement, Shelagh Hancock, chief executive, said: #We are disappointed that it has not been possible to conclude a sale of Campbeltown Creamery. We fully appreciate that this decision has signicant consequences for colleagues at the creamery and the local community, but it is important that we act in the best interest of the wider business and our farmer members and continue with the solid progress we have made in strengthening and developing First Milk.#We regret the impact this decision will have on our colleagues and are committed to treating those affected fairly and with consideration during this dficult time.#Throughout the last  months we have been in regular dialogue with our local members on Kintyre about the future of the site. Nothing will change in respect to their co-operative membership of First Milk, and we will continue to collect and pay for their milk on the same basis as before.#James Barbour, chairman of the Kintyre steering group, added: #It was the right thing to investigate all avenues to seewe could keep the creamery open in Kintyre. There was widespread enthusiasm from the local farmers to try to secure the future of the site and genuine support from First Milk, the Scottish Government and the local community, along with a successful crowdfunding campaign.#Despite all of this we were not able to find a financially viable long-term solution for the creamery. I would like to thank everyone who has supported us through this period.#John Smith, NFUS dairy chairman and local Kintyre dairy farmer, said: #My heart goes out to all the staff that work at the creamery and it is regrettable that the Mull of Kintyre brand that we have passionately supported will now no longer be available. That is due to the harsh, economic reality of processing milk in an incredibly tough dairy industry that has witnessed so many casualties at both farm and processing level in recent times.#While this is very disappointing news, it is reassuring that all of the local farmers are members of First Milk and will continue to benefit from being part of a national co-operative with an evergreen contract and continuing to have their milk collected in the future.#"},{"url":null,"title":"harvest party reaps food bank donations","story":"At the group#s harvest party on Wednesday morning, each child, dressed in ious costumes, some spooky and some sweet, brought an item to donate to the food bank.Kintyre Toy Library meets every Monday and Wednesday from .am to .am, and on Thursdays from -pm, during term-time, in Springbank Evangelical Church Hall.For £ entry, children up to school age enjoy a range of arts and crafts, as well as songs and stories."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 1 2019","story":"It is devastating news for the Kintyre economy that one of the area#s biggest employers looks set to lose up to  per cent of its workforce.It must be devastating news for all CS Wind UK#s staff, with the uncertainty surrounding jobs made all the worse in the lead up to Christmas.The company#s next potential order is due for production in , so there is a future for the factory and we are sure the company is doing all it can to secure that future.Our fingers are crossed that the talks with Argyll and Bute Council, the Scottish and Westminster governments and other organisations are successful in finding a solution to the shortfall in orders.By chance, the news of redundancies at CS Wind came the same week as Amazon revealed its power purchase agreement with a Kintyre wind farm.Attempts by the Courier to confirm the location of the wind farm were unsuccessful but,it comes to fruition, it is to be hoped it will bring jobs to the area."},{"url":null,"title":"springbank and machrihanish help graces pals raise cash","story":"Two nights’ accommodation, a VIP tour and tasting at Springbank Distillery, and a round of golf for eight people at Machrihanish Golf Club were the star lot at an auction in aid of the charity.This was part of an event held by Blairmains Farm Shop and Coffee Bothy in Blairlogie, near Stirling, run by the Logan family and Meg Filshie, who are friends of Kintyre#s David Allen.David and his we Cynthia moved to Campbeltown just over six years ago when David joined Springbank#s sales team.

replaced by a joint community pupil library which opened in the new Wallyford Primary School campus in April.A report to the councilrsquos policy and performance review committee said that the move had seen the number of visits to that library service almost halved.And it added: ldquoAlthough we have improved facilities within the school, there is no public transport to the school and limited car parking so some of our elderly customers are not now using the library.However, the report said there were hopes that when the new housing had been completed at Wallyford, where large development is ongoing, public transport would improve.The council put the increase on physical visits to library branches down to a combination of factors, including ldquoincreasing opening hours, merging library and customer services, increasing digital use and dferent types of events taking place within libraries.It said that the number of e-magazines and e-newspapers issued through the library

libraries in recent years and we have seen the numbers of visits increase by nearly  per cent since .ldquoDespite all the challenges which we face, we have continued to improve the library service which we offer through the opening of the new community library in Wallyford Primary School.ldquoThis has given more support for reading and literacy to primary age children in the Wallyford area and we have also been able to maintain a high level of library opening hours in recent years.The report on the service said: ldquoThe library service has changed signicantly over the years and many more services are provided within our libraries than have been previously.ldquo[The library service] continues to adapt to society changes and demands and going forward the service will be developed to promote reading for pleasure in particular and be available for those who need a bit more support, whether this be through giving assistance with digital developments or guidance in literacy or being a place for people to meet and socialise.The most popular library in the county is in Haddington, where the number of visitors to the John Gray Centre facility was , last year.Haddington and Lammermuir ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoHaddington Library is the busiest in the county and that underscores its importance to the town and the wider community.ldquoItrsquos fantastic to see it being so well used and we should continue to explore what additional facilities and services can be located at the library and the John Gray Centre to ensure they continue to attract residents of

The River Esk snakes around the edge of the course.Prof Crofts expressed concern that dogs could easily swallow them, resulting in ldquolarge vet bills for owners.After ing the balls to the club, he has issued a call for the flood protection scheme, currently being drawn up for Musselburgh, to include measures to slow down water coming off the Pentland and Moorfoot Hills where the North and South Esk rise.Prof Crofts, of Musselburghrsquos Eskside West, a geography expert who has worked as a research scientist in Scotland, said: ldquoAlong the golf course there are very soft banks and you can see where they have been cut back, and probably there was some rough at the end of the fairway where lots of people have lost balls.ldquoWe cannot stop leaves and tree trunks being brought down the river but the speed of rise of the water level and its velocity shows that any flood prevention scheme for Musselburgh needs to look hard at measures to slow down water coming off the hills and into the river. Without this, the erection of walls being proposed in Musselburgh will not be public money well spent.ldquoMany of us feel the importance of the amenity of this stretch of the river ndash it is very fine.He said a tree planting scheme using native species should be discussed with landowners in the headwaters of the Esk catchment area, as government grants were available for such work.He said: ldquoI am talking about hundreds of thousands of trees maybe. Careful hand planting of trees is best rather than using tractors to dig ditches to prepare the land for planting as this would aggravate the problem by increasing the rate of water running off the hills. The trees would take up water from the soil.ldquoThe use of the reservoirs on the North and South Esk and the temporary flooding of the flat land along the river should be seriously investigated to store water during heavy rainfall and therefore slow the release of water into the river.ldquoIf you look at the flood issue, itrsquos caused by the river rising very fast but itrsquos made worsethere are high spring tides and a storm surge in the North Sea, and also a northerly wind across the estuary which piles the water up high and stops the river water escaping for a couple of hours either side of high tide.Professor Crofts has raised his concerns with consultants who are drawing up the Musselburgh Flood Protection Scheme and he has also made local councillors aware of his views.As for the coast, he highlighted small sand dunes which formed a natural barrier with grasses, which, below the ground level, had yards of roots acting as a natural catcher of the sand.Jackie Lambert, captain of Musselburgh Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was unaware of the issue regarding golf balls being found on the beach near the mouth of the River Esk.ldquoWhilst, the figure of  golf balls is signicant, it is unknown over what timescale these balls have accumulated andthey are all, indeed, from the course.ldquoNotwithstanding this, the golf club will happily participate in any working group looking at the wider issues of flood protection and the environment in and around Musselburgh.

I have edited it for publication here, but I have attempted to keep the story as close to the original as possible, and the story itself is completely the idea of the children.IN PRESTONPANS, there lived two nine-year-old children called Max and Lily.One day, they went on a bike ride to Preston Tower for a picnic. When they got there they laid a chequered blanket down on the grass, opened their basket and began to eat.They were about to leave after eating their food when they saw a robin perched on a nearby branch. It seemed friendly and the children fed the wee bird some of their leftovers.The robin then flew to a nearby abandoned cottage. The children were intrigued and followed the robin to investigate the cottage.They couldnrsquot remember noticing it before and they were wandering around it peering inside through small a gap in the wall. They couldnrsquot see where the robin had gone. They should have just left it but curiosity got the better of them and they searched for a way in. They were anxious to find out what had happened to the robin.But there was no way in, as the entrance and windows were blocked. So they clambered up the cottage wall, the bricks crumbling under their feet.Tired and exhausted, they finally reached where they thought the robin had landed.They found an opening which led to a dark passage. Despite being a bit scared, Max and Lily decided to investigate and walked down the passage. It was dimly lit by small gaps in the wall that let in narrow beams of light. At the end, there was a staircase. They huddled together as they walked.Then all of a sudden, the floorboard behind them collapsed.Now in fear and panic, they dashed up the steps of the dilapidated staircase into the attic.From the corner of the attic, they could just make out a small black figure running towards them.They thought they had seen the robin but it was something much worse. ldquoMouse! screamed Lily. Then they heard a glass shatter ndash smash!They were now terried and they sat in pitch darkness. The only light they had was the light that was seeping through the bricks in the walls.As they sat in fear, they realised they needed to come up with a plan to escape. They searched the cottage for a way out.As Lily investigated around the room, she tripped over a rug that seemed to have something poking upwards. She called out for Max and he came rushing down the stairs.As Max kneeled down to take a closer look, Lily revealed what looked like a trapdoor.Astonished, the children pulled the handle.It led to a tunnel which was flooded with candlelight. Who lit the candles  Max and Lily wonderedwhoever had lit the candles knew they were there.They entered the candlelit tunnel and one step at a time they cautiously moved forward.Then, slam! The trapdoor shut behind them and they jumped in fear. This was all too much for them to handle, they were desperate to get out.Then Max heard a soft but evil whisper: ldquoPlease stay, Irsquom lonely.In terror, he pulled out his phone and pressed  but it instantly shut off. ldquoPlease stay, said the voice, now sounding child-like.ldquoHelp! screamed Max and Lily through the gaps in the wall, but help never came.Then they heard something on the floorboards above.ldquoThere must be something up there, said Lily. ldquoI guess the only way out is to follow the candlelight.So they ventured further down the candlelit passageway.As the pair made their way through the tunnel, they could just make out what looked like a white figure approaching, who had a terrying grin with sharp teeth.Max and Lilyrsquos hearts beat uncontrollably as they sprinted away from this terrying image and as they did so all the candles blew out, throwing the children into complete darkness.Was this thing still there  The friends sat together in the darkness breathing heavily, in shock and terror.Suddenly, in the darkness, icy fingers gripped Lilyrsquos arms.ldquoWas that you rsquorsquo asked Lily. ldquoNo, replied Max.All at once, the candles lit up again. Max and Lily turned round and saw a horrying face: ldquoArghhhhhhh!They woke in the sunlight. ldquoWhat  said Max, confused. ldquoWhat just happened   added Lily.ldquoIt must have been a bad dream, said Max. ldquoBut both of us had the same dream, how is that possible ldquoWe had better go, they said.As they were about to leave, they saw a robin.

This was inevitable as she had been travelling one hour each way to get to Dunbar and, even though subsidised by us to make the journey, a two-hour commute is simply not sustainable.Mr Bruneau warned of the impact of demands on private nurseries in April this year when his nursery in Haddington saw its grades fall in an inspection. He said: ldquoThis is a systematic problem which is causing a death spiral in the quality of nursery provision throughout the industry.The inspection report on Dunbarrsquos Pumpkin Patch rated its quality of care and support, staffing and management and leadership at twowith the environment rated a three .The report said that parents had contacted the inspectorate following its unannounced visit in August to discuss concerns.A high turnover in staff was raised by a number of parents, with one telling inspectors: ldquoOften when I drop my child off I have to introduce myself and my child to the agency staff.The report said: ldquoParents told us that they often did not know the staff when they dropped off their children in the morning, often resulting in their children being reluctant to attend.Mr Bruneau said that the introduction of mandatory SSSCregistration was creating recruitment problems throughout the industry.He said: ldquoBefore the advent of SSSC registration, our group of nurseries never used any agency staff as recruitment was simple. It included people of ying ages, experience and circumstance.ldquoIt was a healthy labour market now new staff are iniably under , inexperienced in le, work and certainly the care of children.ldquoNursery closures are inevitable as sites struggle to find staff, maintain standards and satisfy increased demand.He said his company had decided to rationalise itsservices, placing more experience in fewer sites, and called on the Scottish Government to reverse policies he said ruled out more mature staff from working in nurseries.He added that all five members of staff at Dunbar had been offered places at his other nurseries.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council, which used the Dunbar nursery as a partner provider, said: ldquoWe have worked with Pumpkin Patch as one of our partner providers, offering funded early learning and childcare for pre-school children for many years.ldquoOur officers have also provided extensive support to the Dunbar team to help them improve the quality of experiences following recent Care Inspectorate reports. Our assistance has been recognised and appreciated by the owners, who feel that we have done all we can to support them.ldquoWe acknowledge that this will have been a dficult decision for the owners and will have implications for their team at Dunbar. We also acknowledge the upset and disruption that the nursery closure will bring for parents using this service.ldquoOur staff will work with and support parents to find alternative early learning and childcare within the area that meets their needs.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoMore than , children are already benefiting from the expanded entitlement after we increased training opportunities and routes into the early learning and childcare sector, resulting in a record ,-strong workforce.ldquoWe are working alongside local authorities and providers to ensure the necessary workforce is in place ndash including running a national early learning and childcare recruitment campaign, increasing support for training places and modern apprenticeships, and enabling providers to advertise jobs free on the MyJobScotland website."},{"url":null,"title":"pensioner-completes-74-year-quest-discover-father","story":"David Simpson had spent  years looking for his dad after growing up in a Quarriers orphanage to the west of Glasgow before moving across the Atlantic.But his attempts proved fruitless until a visit to long-lost family in Elgin last year.John Hamilton, from Lost Haddington, then became aware of Mr Simpsonrsquos quest.He said: ldquoFrom the information David received from Quarriers, all he knew was that his father was a Jack Cunningham, a plasterer from Goodallrsquos Place in Haddington.ldquoHis niece AnnMarie Whyte did a search for Goodallrsquos Place and the result came back with a find against a Lost Haddington image for the old Goodallrsquos shop on the townrsquos Bridge Street this led to AnnMarie posting a question askingI knew who Jack Cunningham was.ldquoA search of the Lost Haddington collection for Cunningham brought back too many matches, so the search was honed to lsquoplastererrsquo and the results produced the equivalent of a Holy Grail image ndash a George Angus scan of a lsquoJohnrsquo Cunninghamrsquos security application to RAF East Fortune.As well as correcting the name, the image confirmed his occupation and address, as well as his height, hair and eye colour.A plea was put on social media for further information, which found that Johnrsquos nickname was lsquoGibbyrsquo and that David had a cousin living in Musselburgh called Janette Brotherstone.Mr Hamilton said: ldquoAlso, a further search of Lost Haddington for the word lsquoGibbyrsquo, with it being an unusual name, produced another George Angus image from  showing Davidrsquos father John when he was only five or six years old holding the date plate for his school photo ndash George had annotated the image saying the lsquoboy holding the date slate was Gibby Cunninghamrsquo, so when I sent David this image it was the first time hersquod seen his father.ldquoThe feedback from the Lost Haddington followers also indicated that John died in  when he lived at No  St Annrsquos Place.ldquoThrough the invaluable feedback which named Janette as his first cousin, David was put in touch with her and shersquos since sent him some old family photos showing his father throughout his le.ldquoThe photos came from Davidrsquos fatherrsquos home, where he died, as it was Janette who dealt with the death notices for both Davidrsquos father and Johnrsquos we Jessie Cagder.ldquoDavid visited Scotland in autumn  so I offered to bring him to Haddington, which he accepted.From there, David, who now lives in Rochester, New York, was able to see the home where his dad was born on Haddingtonrsquos St Martinrsquos Gate, as well as his homes on Goodallrsquos Place and St Annrsquos Place.It is thought Davidrsquos dad was lodged with a landlady while working in Elgin in .According to Mr Hamilton: ldquoThe landladyrsquos husband was away from home for two years as a soldier in World War Two and itrsquos during this period that John and the landlady must have had a moment of indiscretion together, which produced David!ldquoWhen the landladyrsquos husband ed home from the war due to injury and found his we holding baby David ndash that couldnrsquot have been his ndash he gave his we the ultimatum: lsquoTake him to the orphanage or itrsquos a orce.rsquoldquoAt the age of around one month old, David was taken to the Quarriers orphanage which is near the Bridge of Weir to the west of Glasgow.David left Quarriers at the age of  and eventually moved to Winnipeg in Canada in  before eventually settling in New York.More than  years ago, he began his bid to track down his family.

Bruce also appeared to confuse Vote Leave with the Leave.EU campaign.The young woman defended her position, but was told by Bruce ldquono criminal charges were brought.The right-wing journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who was a list, then jumped in to say: ldquoThe vast majority of allegations about both Leave campaigns were found to be completely untrue. This was propaganda.The audience member was correct, however ndash Vote Leave broke the law. Yet, any viewer would have left the programme believing the opposite.This is a critical failure by the BBC. The national broadcaster is meant to provide unbiased, accurate reporting. It did the opposite on Question Time.This General Election is one that will be fought on lies, deceit and manipulation. Thatrsquos why facts, truth and trust are the most vital issues for the electorate.Herersquos a reminder of what the BBC should have told viewers. Vote Leave was fined pound, for breaking electoral law over spending limits. In March this year, it dropped its appeal against the fine. Vote Leave was fronted by Boris Johnson. Cummings was campaign director.The Electoral Commission said: ldquoSerious offences such as these undermine public confidence in our system and it is vital, therefore, that they are properly investigated and sanctioned.A day after Question Time aired, it emerged evidence relating to overspending, which could lead to criminal charges against Vote Leave, had been passed by police to the Crown Prosecution Service.The House of Commonrsquos Privileges Committee said Cummings had committed a contempt of Parliament by not appearing to give evidence when ordered as part of an inquiry into fake news.The fact that Question Time acted as a distributor for lies on an issue which is right at the very heart of Brexit and the forthcoming General Election makes the broadcasterrsquos failings ever more egregious.I donrsquot see bias at every turn with the BBC. Irsquove mostly great respect for the broadcaster in terms of its journalism and also its cultural output. When I see it attacked by both right and left, Leave and Remain, unionists and Yes voters, Irsquom pretty confident itrsquos doing its job and holding all sides of the political spectrum to account. Demonstrations against the BBC and hate campaigns against reporters run contrary to every democratic bone in my body. I see them as the first steps on the path to authoritarianism and populism.However, the BBC as a whole suffers from a fatal weakness: its automatic default position is to defend the status quo. When authority speaks, it accepts and parrots, it doesnrsquot question and interrogate. Radical voices are subjected to withering scrutiny, reactionary voices are treated with respect and dignity. This skews debate and immediately sets up imbalance.We saw the same problem here in Scotland during the independence referendum. The knee-jerk position was to subject the Yes campaign to forensic investigation, while broadly accepting most of what the No campaign said on face value. Both sides should have been put under the same pressure.There are also flaws built in to Question Time, which are now becoming damaging to democracy.

Emily Thornberry, shadow foreign secretary, wrote to the government asking about his connections to Russia and the level of security vetting to which hersquos been subjected in Downing Street.Amid all this, wersquove the truly grave threat Facebook poses to democracy. The social media giant will allow British politicians to run  ads on the site. To make the matter even more disgusting, the policy is being championed by Facebook executive Nick Clegg, the former LibDem deputy Prime Minister, who once spoke out about ldquothe colossal scale of the lies spread by the Leave campaign.Johnson and his new Tory radicals are also shameless in their deceit. Outgoing European Commission President, Jean-Claude Junker, said yesterday of the EU referendum: ldquoSo many lies were told, including by current prime minister, Boris Johnson, that there needed to be a voice to counter them.Chief among the voices countering lies should be the BBC. It shouldnrsquot be amplying hoods. Perhaps, one starting solution would be to change the format of Question Time by adding in a fact-checker service. While the  debate, a team of journalists could sit behind them double-checkingwhat they are saying is true. If they lie, fact-checkers should interrupt the show and tell viewers the truth. That would be a real service to democracy, and to the public, when we need it most.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":null,"title":"decision-omit-snp-sky-election-debate-defies-democracy-says-nicola-sturgeon","story":"The First Minister was askedshe was lsquocrossrsquo with Sky News for her party being omitted from the debates Nicola Sturgeon said that the decision lsquoldquodefied democracy.Speaking to Kay Burley on Breakfast she said: ldquoI donrsquot want to personalise it but I think all broadcasters really need to consider whether theyrsquore reflecting politics as it is or as theyrsquod like it to be.ldquoThe SNP is the biggest party in Scotland, the biggest party in government in Scotland, the third biggest party in the UK, we may hold the balance of power after this election.

wins themSuch changes have the potential to ldquovastly increase devolution of food safety regulation, according to the report, creating the prospect of trade barriers between England and Scotland or Wales.Dr Emily Lydgate, a senior environmental law lecturer at the University of Sussex and one of the authors of the study, said: ldquoFood safety SIs are a potential flash-point for Scotland ndash which wants to maintain alignment with the EU ndash and Westminster, which promises to pursue a US trade deal that will alter UK food safety legislation.ldquoNegotiating a US trade deal that Scotland opposes is certainly not viable and could even fuel a push for Scottish independence.ldquoIf one or more devolved administrations refuses to realign its food safety regulations from those of the EU to comply with US standards after a US-UK free trade agreement, it will complicate the flows of agricultural and food products within the UK.ldquoThis raises the question of how the UK can avoid introducing internal UK regulatory controls and border checks to ensure that products comply with ergent jurisdictional requirements.The report also suggests EU safeguards on food standards will be weakened as soon as the UK leaves, with the Government planning to scrap the requirement for independent scientic assessments on the safety of pesticides and allowing minister to lower thresholds for labelling when genetically-modied crops are used.Professor Erik Millstone, emeritus professor in the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex, said: ldquoOur analysis suggests Brexit SIs will allow ministers to exercise considerable powers of discretion when authorising ingredients in pesticide products, amending GMO authorisations and thresholds for labelling, authorising food additives and approving substances for animal carcass washes.ldquoMinisters may issue guidance impacting substantive policy content or make new rules governing food safety by secondary legislation, without proper parliamentary scrutiny and using powers that exceed those vested by the EU in the European Commission.ldquoThose considerable powers could be a way to overcoming parliamentary resistance and public opposition to aspects of a UK-US trade deal.Recommending that devolved nations have ldquostrong oversight over UK external trade negotiations, the study also calls for primary

Originally coined some years ago by older campaigners wishing for a more sustainable, secure and resilient system of food production and distribution, the -year-old Scot is taking up the baton ndash albeit it on a tiny Perthshire footprint.Four years ago, at the age of , the Dunkeld-born student became the youngest-ever finalist in the long-running reality baking show The Great British Bake-Off [GBBO]. Watched by  million viewers worldwide, she was the runner-up in the  finale and instantly became a media darling. Evidently thrilled and reassured in equal measure to have such a young woman embrace ndash in her reassuring mid-Scots accent ndash the ancient culinary art of baking using centuries-old techniques, print and broadcast commissioning editors flocked to her oven door. Her first cookbook was published, and her online presence rose faster than the lightest souffle. Here was a new domestic goddess in whose delicate hands baking was safe. The world, it seemed, was her ice-cream oyster.Then she turned the tables. Eschewing the bright lights, she has settled instead for her own tiny craft bakery in a th century village in rural Perthshire where she quietly and happily puts in a -hour day. Itrsquos from this modest ndashinfinitely pretty ndash base that she hopes to influence our relationship with food for the better.Not that shersquos about to disappear completely: with its white-painted -year-old stone walls, original black range, front door draped with garlands of dried flowers, the setting for her glass-fronted display of fresh craft bakery items, Aran, is the last word in Instagrammability. Named after the Gaelic for bread, it is also the title of her second cookbook.ldquoYeah, it was a bit of a ballsy move, she agrees of her snap decision to buy the bakery in . ldquoItrsquos been wonderful. I call it my flour oasis. Wersquore perched on little white-painted stepping stools in a corner of the busy shop floor, trying not to get in the way of the constant stream of customers ndash a combination of locals and tourists ndash looking for her trademark homemade croissants, cakes, pastries and sourdough breads which have sustainability hard-baked into every bite.Shedden put her studies on hold ndash she was doing a history of art degree at St Andrews ndash to set up Aran with her friend Angus and her boyfriend of just five months at the time, James Irvine, who now manages the Birnam Arts Centre. The pair live together in the flat above the shop. A crowdfunding campaign raised pound, for refurbishment and grants from the SSE windfarm community fund, combined with a bank loan and proceeds from her first book Gatherings, made her long-held dream possible.ldquoIrsquod immediately become jealous when Angus told me he had a lsquobread shedrsquo, a place where he would create loaves upon loaves post-work and early in the morning, she says. ldquoHis magic little set-up was exactly what I had been looking for. It took a year for the trio and other family and friends to get the bakery open.I remark on how busy Aran is, and am informed it does some  transactions a day . The elongated Scottish tourist season means they are busy all year round rather than the traditional Easter to September.ldquoPeople have no idea how much work goes into this and how much we bake every single day, she says. A production kitchen on a small industrial park up the road in Birnam has helped alleviate the flow.So far, so impressive.But Irsquom intrigued.Alongside gorgeous recipes on how to make the goodies in the bakery ndash think Whisky Eccles cakes, pistachio and lime loaf, or butternut squash and Birnam honey loafndash her new book features little drop-in biogs of her regular customers and staff, many of them men, and also of her father. So the female vibe of her previous book, in which she praised the influence of women on home cooking, seems to have morphed into something more collegiate and collaborative ndash as well as less sugary-sweet. Aran follows a day in the le of the bakery, hour by hour and ritual by ritual, and there are recipes for sandwiches, salads, savoury tarts and sandwiches ndash and a heavy emphasis on sourdough breads, brioches and croissants.So, does running a bakery span the genders  ldquoYeah, it used to be all women but the balance is more even now. In fact, I call my team lsquoThe Boysrsquo, she says. ldquoGatherings was more focused on home and family whereas this is much bigger and wider in scope and people. What wersquore doing here is definitely more collaborative. People of both genders bring in ideas and suggestions, either orally or from memory, and we try them out. Wersquore doing continual RD and things are developing organically. And in the village, the wider community spirit is strong.She makes a point of sourcing ingredients, including the all-important flour, from the community and from Scotland as much as possible. Salmon is from the Dunkeld Smoke House, honey from master beekeeper John Taylor, and fresh produce is from the organic Dunkeld and Birnam Community Growing, known as The Field, and from Blackhall Farm. Butter is from Grahamrsquos Dairies, although her Lescure patisserie butter ndash good for croissants and pastries due to its high fat content ndash is from France. With Brexit in mind, she is looking for alternative local sources to provide her with the  kilos she goes through every week.ldquoThe really important thing for us is to be sustainable, she says.Her message about eating sensibly is also strong, and she cites the Rome-based food writer Rachel Roddy and the Irish writer Diana Henry as her food heroes for their ldquosensible approach to healthy eating.In Aran, she writes: ldquoSugar gets a bad rep, as does gluten, sadly. But my principles remain the same throughout this bizarre time. Use proper and honest ingredients and think of food as a source of fuel and satisfaction, not as something to fear or discuss negatively.Kale, which she says, ldquogets all the attention by the clean-eaters, and I worry it will put people off it, features strongly in her salad section alongside squash, carrot tops, heirloom tomatoes and asparagus. Therersquos a foraged nettle and pea quiche in a nod to Scottish culinary history and nettle pudding, ldquothe oldest recorded pudding in the book, but unlikely to make a reappearance.Her misgivings echo those expressed in the  Gatherings, in which she lamented the number of people of her age-group that she knew to have eating disorders or troubled relationships with food, and how ldquoearth-shattering that could be.The equal balance between sweet and savoury in Aran is notable, and again echoes the authorrsquos desire to change perceptions that baking is all about sweetness and stodge.Does she think her peer-group ndash at almost  she is somewhere between a Millennial and the younger so-called Generation Z ndash are confused about food and diet  ldquoYes, she replies, without hesitation. ldquoI am from the generation with arguably the most delusional approach to food. Therersquos so much noise surrounding it on social media. The influencer set are hugely to blame when it comes to diet issues. People arenrsquot sure about where they stand as they receive mixed messages almost every day.With veganism gaining in popularity among Gen Zedders, does she offer vegan options  ldquoA couple, but thatrsquos not something we do massively, she replies, with an almost imperceptible sigh. ldquoApart from the fact that itrsquos very hard to cater for every possible dietary requirement, our ethos here is hugely based on local, as opposed to dietary.ldquoTherersquos quite a contentious discourse about veganism. I think itrsquos doing more damage to the planet than eating dairy from the farm  miles down the road.\"As well as her concerns about food miles, she also has health worries. ldquoI think itrsquos crazy to eliminate so many food groups at once, as veganism advocates. Itrsquos about cutting out a huge amount of the foods wersquove been eating for thousands of years. Problems seem to have occurred with the processed foods wersquove had available for the last  years. Tradition has never done us any harm. Now everyonersquos terried about their health.Sipping milky tea and casting an eye over the ever-forming queue at the counter, she continues: ldquoIt makes me laugh when people come in to our bakery looking for gluten-free. But you can eat our sourdough bread because itrsquos slow-fermented for  hours, which reduces the gluten content dramatically, is more easily digested and therefore better for your gut. I spend a lot of time trying to tell people to try sourdough because itrsquos the best thing you can possibly eat.ldquoI tell them thatthey buy a supermarket loaf they should toast it before eating it to finish off the baking. Itrsquos over-processed and over-yeasted to bake in minutes rather than days and contains  ingredients instead of just three or four. When you eat it itrsquos going to keep cooking in your stomach and make you feel heavy and bloated. Bread should never feel heavy.ldquoEverything processed is why wersquove lost touch with fresh food. E-numbers, additives, colourants, preservatives and so on are all man-made and, of course, theyrsquore going to cause damage and health problems. Naturally occurring ingredients are hardly to blame.Traditional Scottish iced gingerbread, almond and pistachio croissants and chocolate brownies are her biggest sellers. ldquoItrsquos OK to have sugar in moderation. Little and often, she says, smiling. Her own favourites are the sourdough sandwiches made fresh every day and filled with locally sourced greenery. ldquoWe donrsquot do them to order, otherwise wersquod be making cheese and ham every day, she says, grinning.She already has her eyes on the future, and hopes to open a village greengrocers soon. ldquoWe want to stay in Dunkeld and open a village store where things will be properly sourced and we can support the local area, she says. ldquoAt the moment we can only buy plastic-wrapped apples from Spain at the local Co-op. Wersquod like to further help the local growers and producers, while completing the circular system in terms of sustainability, cutting food waste and increasing food security.She concedes that shersquos in the privileged position of being in the main street of a historic village which is popular with tourists with no large supermarkets or fast-food chains to dilute her influence. The local independent butcher, smokehouse, deli and whisky shop are hardly going to do that. In fact, she believes she is part of wider grassroots movement in Scotland that is being fed ndash and in turn consumed ndash by social media.The downside of being part of the Gen Z zeitgeist is she has in the past fallen foul of social mediarsquos more unpleasant side. A self-taught cook who grew up in Dunkeld, Shedden suffered a Twitter backlash when, as a contestant on GBBO, she said shersquod forgotten to switch on the electric oven because her parents had an Aga at home that she had over  cookbooks, most of them French and that she had picked up a recipe for biscotti while travelling in Italy. Such comments resulted in the Twittersphere posting that she was ldquotoo posh, ldquotoo middle-class and ldquotoo professional ndash comments that were picked up by the tabloids.She says now: ldquoI havenrsquot been on Twitter for months. I love Instagram, itrsquos a great way to communicate and a huge part of our business comes through it. It also helped us market our Crowdfunding campaign. It is about sharing. It is far more my vibe and less threatening than Twitter.ldquoThrough Instagram it never fails to amaze me how many fantastic wee independent food places, producers and initiatives there are right across Scotland now, she adds. ldquoI think people are a lot more aware of what theyrsquore eating and where their food comes from. They are aware of sourcing and what theyrsquore putting in their systems. Theyrsquore more interested in that than in price. I like to think that from our tiny part of the planet wersquore changing things bit by bit.Aran, Recipes and Stories from a Bakery in the Heart of Scotland, by Flora Shedden, is published by Hardie Grant at pound.BUTTERNUT SQUASH AND BIRNAM HONEYWe do our absolute best to source as many local ingredients as possible, and always encourage customers to come through the door with any of their own goods.

They give birth to a single calf each year, and those that reproduce earlier in the year have more offspring over their letime.This is partly because of an association between the genes that causes the hinds to give birth earlier and higher overall reproductive success.As a result, genes for breeding earlier have become more common in the Rum red deer over time.Professor Pemberton said: ldquoWe are seeing hinds respond dferently during their letimes. A female that has a calf on a certain date in a cold year will have a calf on an earlier date following a warm summer. Something is changing that the animals are responding to and it seems to be the summer temperatures before the rut which is promoting grass growth.After a warm summer, the animals are coming into oestrus earlier, mating, conceiving and birthing earlier but after cold summers the findings were reversed, said Professor Pemberton.She said: ldquoSome of the changes wersquore seeing is because things are getting warmer and the animals are responding to that in their letimes, which wersquore calling plastic change.Traditionally the calving season has been from mid June but due to the altered environmental conditions, researchers have noted the season beginning as early as late May.The study also shows that the rutting season, antler casting and cleaning are all shting ndash and by a very similar time.The findings indicate that red deer could continue to thrive under changing weather: ldquoIn principle,the population can evolve, which is very strongly suggested by the data, then it will allow it to do well under changed environmental conditions.But more research on the impact of winter weather would need to be carried out to understand the final consequences of climate change.The study is unique in that it is teasing out the ious dferent causes of the calving changes, although researchers across the world are investigating how organisms are adapting to environmental change.Professor Pemberton said: ldquoThere has been a lot of discussion on whether animals are going to be able to change genetically and fast enough so this would be an indication that perhaps they will be able to.The research, published in the PLOS Biology journal, was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council.Sally Thomas, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos director of people and nature, said: ldquoThese findings are a fascinating example of the impact climate change may be having on wildle.ldquoMore and more research is demonstrating climate change is influencing species across the UK and the world. We are seeing growing evidence of the effects on Scotlandrsquos nature.ldquoSome species are finding it dficult to deal with changes, while others are moving northwards as conditions begin to change."},{"url":null,"title":"everyones-loser-brexit-general-election-race","story":"OK: Europe was always going to dominate, but why do all the parties seem to lose any sense of reality as soon as they talk about it :Brexit lsquocould mean border checks between England, Scotland and WalesrsquoJeremy Corbyn made a valiant effort yesterday to pretend that Brexit was really about the NHS.

Based on the suggested p per item charge planned for the Scottish DRS, a -can pack would have £. deposit added to the usual cost price, while four two-litre bottles would incur p in fees.When faced with this choice, two thirds of shoppers currently buying cans in multipacks said they would likely switch to plastic bottles. Even with a p flat-rate deposit, half of those polled said they would still choose larger bottles over multipacks.This could mean millions more plastic bottles being produced each year, potentially ending up as litter – the problem the DRS aims to solve. Alupro representatives are meeting MSPs at the Scottish Parliament today to call for a range of refundable levies to be set, based on the capacity of each container. Rick Hindley, executive director of Alupro, said: “We are very concerned thatthe same deposit fee is applied regardless of container size, it will have a signicant impact on multipacks of aluminium cans. “The majority of consumers buy multipacks, and these will become twice as expensive as the equivalent volume in plastica depositscheme is introduced with the same deposit fee. “This would be a signicant up-front cost for household budgets and, as our survey has confirmed, it will influence purchasing habits.”He urged the Scottish and UK governments to consider the impact of other schemes – the German drink can market is only just starting to recover from a  per cent drop in can sales when a deposit scheme was launched in .He added: “Our survey found  per cent of people are concerned that a depositscheme could increase the consumption of plastic. We must avoid this scenario playing out in the UK.”Unlike plastic, aluminium cans are endlessly recyclable.Three quarters of the aluminium ever produced is still in use today,while three quarters of all plastic made is now in the marine environment.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish wild deer provide early proof animals evolving in response to climate change","story":"Wild deer living on a Scottish island have provided some of the first proof that animals are evolving in response to climate change, new research has found.Scientists have discovered that red deer on the Isle of Rum have undergone genetic changes that have helped them adapt to rising temperatures and shting weather conditions in recent decades.They say the results of the study show Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution in action.Previous studies have shown the dates deer on Rum produce their young has been moving forward since the s, at a rate of about three days per decade.Analysis shows alterations in the animal’s genetic make-up have played a key role in the rapid sht in birth dates that has taken place.This has been partly due to the effects of warmer temperatures on the deer’s behaviour and physiology, but also due to genetic changes caused by natural selection.The research team made the discovery using field records and genetic data collected on Rum over a -year period since .They say the study provides rare evidence of evolution happening quickly enough to be seen over a short timespan.Academics from the universities of Edinburgh, St Andrews and Cambridge and the Australian National University took part in the study. “This is one of the few cases where we have documented evolution in action, showing that it may help populations adapt to climate warming,” said lead researcher Dr Timothée Bonnet, of the Australian National University.Professor Josephine Pemberton, from the University of Edinburgh’s School of Biological Sciences, said: “Long-term studies of inidual letimes are one of the few ways to understand how populations respond to environmental change and how to manage its effects.”Sally Thomas, director of people and nature at Scottish Natural Heritage, which manages the Isle of Mull nature reserve, said: “These findings are a fascinating example of the impact climate change may be having on wildle. “More and more research is demonstrating climate change is influencing species across the UK and the world.”Female red deer, known as hinds, give birth to a single calf each year. Those that reproduce earlier in the year have more offspring over their letime, the researchers say.The findings show this is partly because of a link between the genes that make hinds give birth earlier and higher breeding success. As a result, these genes have become more common in the Rum population over time.The study, funded by the Natural Environment Research Council, is published in the journal PLOS Biology.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"general election 2019 briefing second apology for grenfell comments more tory moderates stand down","story":"Welcome to The Scotsman#s daily election briefing as Britain prepares to go to the polls on December .Here#s all you need to know for the day ahead.Tory MP apologises over defence of Jacob Rees-Moggs Grenfell commentswindow.twttr A second senior Conservative MP has had to apologise after insensitive comments about the Grenfell Tower fire, following outrage over Jacob Rees-Moggs assertion that he would have ignored Fire Service advice to remain in the building.

To take your comment a little further, I would say that the Arts are capable of contributing much more to human le and activity than has ever been so in the past.We are rapidly becoming slaves to science as well as being beneficiaries of its wonderful contributions to le in its widest sense.The attempts that we see to put one on a higher plane than the other are futile.Every facet of human endeavour should be in the mix with the aim of formingrounded rather than fragmented people.Very well put Haydn! The Arts also let people see their inidual and collective issues, wants and needs from dferent perspectives, so also assist democracy.Expressing our creativity is also a FUNdamental part of being human, and happily there are good dancers, singers and storytellers everywhere.If humanity is to survive and prosper an understanding of the Sciences and of the STEM subjects, is vital. Sadly our political classes are mostly in ignorance of the sciences, at every level. Their bizarre and idiotic decisions display that so well. A simple example, Shetland Island Council promotes and acquires battery-powered cars to reduce CO emissions. It only has, at this time, fossil fuel-generated power to charge them with, the result.an increase in CO footprint. How scientically mindless and stupid.Oh and don#t get me started on electric cars. I#ve driven a so called gas guzzler for years. I#ve not seen any so called climate change myself, yet still I drive. It still snows in winter does it not, yet the #green# lobby would have us believe that it will be raining frogs by we don#t change our ways. What utter tosh.Actually Jerry, the winters in Shetland are exceptionally mild these days. You can, literally, count on your hands the number of days it snows. Whether this is due to human activity and this of global warming is maybe questionable, BUT the evidence would suggest it probably is the case human activity being the major cause Is there a connection, overall,between global warming and much milder winters  I sincerely hope global warming is not a situation where, like most progression, some massive disaster has to take place before we do something about Maybe there’s a touch of the prophet in his own country not being recognised.Do I detect a wee bit of sarcasm there, Haydn  lolCan the SIC backing transition to battery powered cars reasonably be described as #bizarre and idiotic# Maybe Ian Tinkler hasn#t fully thought this through.The council#s decision to buy some electric cars helps to extend the necessary infrastructure across the isles, meaning Shetland becomes more ready to welcome visitors with electric cars.The incentives to change over will probably improve and more people will want to swap over.They will need the infrastructure which the SIC#s decision to acquire a greener fleet supports. Shetland#s own generated electricity can and will become cleaner overtime, so it seems a little hard to justy Ian#s claim that the council#s decision was #scientically mindless and stupid#.Its still not entirely clear what self-proclaimed scientic expert Ian#s beliefs and motives are, but climate change deniers might well describe preparing for the future as #bizarre and idiotic#. If Ian can#t come up with a dferent tune, perhaps he can change the record.Perhaps it may just be an intelligent option to wait until Shetland has a clean, non-diesel, power generating capacity be for investing tens and tens of thousands of pounds in an electric car fleet! Especially when tunning these cars vans produce a greater carbon footprint than diesel engine cars would in any case.. A bit too deep for you Peter  Visiting Shetland with electric cars has nothing to do with whatever transport fleet the SIC operate. After all, we have a good towage fleet, when batteries run flat.I agree with Ian. Does this mean he has changed his mind on the Viking wind farm then I see Shetland council have taken delivery of  electric cars. No cars were tunned . They were new.Buying new diesel cars would not have a lower carbon footprint versus buying new electric cars. The embodied energy to produce and ship both is similar. Yes,the electricity is produced through burning fossil fuels it means they are not zero emissions once delivered. But they soon will be as long as Ian doesn#t get his way with Viking. Of course, Ian will not be around to see the worst effects of climate change so can afford to worry about his views. Far more important than the future of humanity, when you balance it up## self-proclaimed scientic expert!!#, your word Peter, just graduate knowledge. Any youngster with Standard Grade science subjects would understand my points, Peter Hamilton. Clearly The STEM subjects were well outside your teaching brief.

If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise. We should now learn to adapt to it, rather than call it #overtourism# and hope that it goes away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH2510NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 25th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Instead, it leads to the booze aisle in thelocal supermarket and to a drinking den out on the moor.In this, the maincharacter in Kevin MacNeil’s novel ‘The Stornoway Way’ is depicted as havingmuch in common with his fellow islanders, whether or not they absorb their localminister’s thunderous moralising. Theplay of the same name, which MacNeil also wrote, pulls no punches so far asdevastating social critique is concerned.There’s a lot in a name. RomanStornoway can be read as romance torn away. He is also R Stornoway. He is a religiouscuckoo in the nest and the key in a roman a clef. The character himselfacknowledges all this. As an everyman outsider, Mister S is meant tocommunicate a great deal about Lewis.Calvinism, alcohol and climatecombine in a pernicious cocktail that permeates people and place. Depression, repression and addiction are endemic.So are dreams of escape.If this is the desolate reality in which MacNeil’s characters are immersed, the play of the novel # staged by Dogstar Theatre at Sabhal Mor Ostaig last week # sugars the pill with scabrous wit, hilarious minor characters, and some truly moving songs, among them a traditional Gaelic lament rendered with crystalline clarity by Lewis-born actor Rachel Kennedy. It is a sublime moment where Roman reconnects with the culture he scorns. But the moment passes, and the song of loss and love is soon replaced with cynicism and tomorrow’s hangover.All good writing, whetherfor page or stage, interweaves the personal, the local and the universal. Roman’s war is with himself and with Lewishis dreams are of finding love and self-fulfilment. The universal arrives inthe shape of Eva, a Hungarian student who initially succumbs to Roman’s scatterguncharm, but who later comes to see him as self-obsessed and manipulative. Roman is certainly that. Heis also vulnerable, funny, and capable of great profundity.Self-fulfilment comesthrough music, and when Roman’s long-suffering best friend Eilidh organises asession for him in a recording studio in Edinburgh, the road to salvationopens. But Roman is a master at self-sabotage. Matters don’t quite go to plan.Naomi Stirrat as Roman,Rachel Kennedy as Eilidh and Chloe-Ann Tylor as Eva are all fine actors, and adeptat lively theatricality. As an ensemble,they tick like a Swiss watch, darting here and there without missing a beat. Andthey can’t half belt out a tune. As with all adaptations,there are issues concerning the episodic aspect of narrative fiction and how thisworks on stage, in real-time. In ‘The Stornoway Way’ scene transitions areheralded by brief drum patterns that wouldn’t sound out of place in an Americansitcom. But that is to cavil. MacNeil’s play is at least as good as his novel, and the novel was very good indeed."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_20191028_101405.jpg","title":"competition underway to create a flag for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoinen.This weeksees the launch of a competition to design a flag, which will be recognised by the Court of Lord Lyon — the body responsible for recording and protecting all heraldry, flags and national symbols in Scotland — and will be flown and displayed as an emblem of the island at home and abroad., Highland Council ward members and tourism body SkyeConnect petitioned the court with the idea for a flag following the example of several other island areas and regions which have, in recent years, adopted a flag.Philip Tibbetts, honorary vexillologist with the Court of the Lord Lyon, is to visit schools on the island next week to deliver a series of workshops and presentations detailing his interest in flags, and discussing the themes which could potentially inspire a flag for Skye.It is hoped youngsters and adults will be keen to have a go at designing the flag, and enter the competition which will run from st November until st December, after which a  — made up of representatives from throughout the community — will compile a short list of final entries which will then become subject of a public vote in February of next year.or by post to Skye Flag Competition, c o West Highland Free Press, Unit B, Pairc nan Craobh, Broadford, Isle of Skye IV AP, the potential for both the design and subsequent usage of a flag for the island is incredible.”In addition to the information provided on this page, these links will be helpful:"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/LOVAT-STUART-MACDONALD-2-adj.jpg","title":"shinty hurling to take centre stage as scotland visit face ireland this","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineTwo Kinlochshiel players, Finlay MacRae and Donald Nixon, are in the Scotland squad for the senior shinty-hurling match.At under- level Alan MacRae has named a -man squad seeking to seal a second win in succession against the Irish.Skye#s William MacKinnon is in line for his debut, while there is also a place in the squad for Johnnie MacAskill, the ex-Kinlochshiel player, now playing for Glasgow Mid Argyll.

Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her.Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she did it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family.Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care.This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  .We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us.This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby.We decided to host Rubys Birthday Fundraiser last year and it was a huge success, raising an amazing pound,. The whole community and local business were fully behind us and couldn’t have done it without them. The NI Childrens Hospice is the only one of its kind in Northern Ireland providing care to  children with le limiting conditions.The annual running cost of the Hospice is pound.million, that is for four rooms of the  the hospice has - the hope would be to get all  rooms funded and running.The government support is only % of this, thats why the Hospice relies so heavily on fundraising events to keep this facility running for families like ourselves.My goal in le is to keep Ruby’s memory alive and by holding her parties its raising money in Ruby’s name for the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice.We will be forever indebted to the Hospice for all the support they gave us during Ruby’s le with respite, end of le care and all the memories we created in Horizon House. I continue to tell my story of grief and Ruby’s le on my blog Chasingladybirds it has been a good way help journey through grief and to also reach out to others in the same situation.Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started.In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief.Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.Admission costs pound for adults and children go free. There will bouncing castles, soft play, face painting, nail painting, little gladiators, cake sale and a raffle with an array of great prizes,as well as Victoria Sponges with filled do-nuts.Raffle tickets cost pound a strip and can be purchased before the partythey can’t attend by contacting Lisa via Instagram: @chasingladybirds or Facebook: Lisa Powell.The fun kicks off at pm until pm and most importantly all money raised goes towards this vital cause - a poignant and fitting way to remember little Rubys legacy.

I really trust him and the cast can see how his mind works as a director.”Known for her comedic roles, Katie spoke of how it was great to sink her teeth into a dramatic role. “This is a real love story of a middle class Protestant who falls in love with an Irish rebel – and we’ll leave it there,” she laughed.“I don’t want to give too much away. Myself and fellow actor Maria Connolly are on stage the whole time, linking the threadsyou like. It is such a lovely piece of writing by Kate.“Kate’s son Sean, one of the forces behind the Dead Rabbit Bar in New York, will be offering an Irish coffee before the show courtesy of the bar as well. It is a very limited run, just over two nights, but it’s wonderful that audiences will be able to see Kate’s final work.”The piece, produced by GBL Productions’ Briege Lynch, is an emotional one for all involved as Briege said she knew Kate since she was four.“I’m very honoured to have Betrothed as my first producing credit,” she said. “I’ve known and loved Kate since I was four running in and out of the Community Arts Forum offices as a young child where my dad, Martin, was director and Kate was the administrator. I probably got under her feet a lot but she was always so kind and caring and would sneak me treats. I’m sad that she isn’t here to bask in the glory of getting this writing from the page to the stage.”Betrothed by Kate Muldoon runs at the Grand Opera House in the Baby Grand from November  and .

The event will also see launch of a groundbreaking new report that outlines a framework for community development.The paper, entitled ‘We Must Dissent’, is the result of a community survey that assessed the human rights of local residents against the major issues facing the area. Amongst the issues identied were concerns around road safety, housing, health, education, and unemployment.Another key issue was the pressures of commercial land speculation in the area, which has presented an obstacle to the community development of the Lanyon Tunnels.Despite planning permission and £.million being granted for the development, plans have been stalled by owners of an adjacent piece of land – which was subject to plans to build a £million office block.In , residents won a legal victory when the High Court ruled that planning approval for office block was unlawful. However, the potential for future plans to develop the land could impede access to the tunnelsgiven the go-ahead.Speaking ahead of next Wednesday’s event, Fionntán Hargey from the Market Development Association said the tunnels development would provide a “massive boost to people’s self esteem”.“It would physically reconnect them to city centre and it would also reconnect them into the economic, social and cultural le of Belfast. “The tunnels got planning permission in , and there is £. million in funding sitting there ready to go, and there are three groups of residents trained up and they’ve got business places developed. We also have updated drawings that have recently been commissioned. “The issue is that there is a private developer who is refusing to grant access to allow the project to go ahead.”He continued: “Next Wednesday will refresh people on the latest concept drawings and give people wider overview of the Redeveloping the Local Economy programme. Our aspiration is that by January we will be launching a report, and we will have several groups of residents with business ideas that are on course for development.” Next Wednesday’s event will take place at pm in the Market Community Centre where guest speaker, Dr Sean Byers, will discuss the economics of community empowerment. There will also be a full project update on the Lanyon Tunnels."},{"url":null,"title":"an a5 public inquiry is the route to","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It’s very important to Kansas City.”"},{"url":null,"title":"491568","story":"IT was an evening of celebration at the Seamus Heaney HomePlace last Monday as members of the Baha’i community gathered to mark  years since the birth of the Baacuteb.Opening the special evening, organised by the Mid Ulster Bahai community, was Martin Kearney.The chair of Mid Ulster Distict Council welcomed those to the very special BiCentenary event, praisin the work of members in the community.Cllr Kearney said: “Locally, the Baha’is have taken part in many of Council led initiatives aimed at integration and have been quietly serving the local community for over half a century in fields as erse as the equality of men and women, protection of family le, protection of the environment, renewable energy, integrated education, support of the arts and training youths to be virtuous and of service to their local communities and this support is welcomed by the Mid Ulster Council.”The chairmans address was followed with a speech by the Rev Dr Adrian Nigel Stringer.He praised the welcome he was given by the Baacutehaacutei community when researching his Thesis and then provided scriptural justicationfor interfaith co-operation. He sent heartfelt greetings from the Christian community to the Baacutehaacutei community on the occasion of the th anniversary of the birth of the Baacuteb. His kind greetings were reciprocated by the MC for the evening Dr Les Gornall, from Ballymoghan in Magherafelt. Dr Gornall provided a short history of the Baacuteb, one of the twin founders of the Baha’i Faith and the example of the Baacuteb’s disciples. Many were killed for their belief.Catalina Suarez also performed on the night with a rendition of ‘She moved through the Fair’.The work of the local Baha’i community was illustrated and one of the Magherafelt Baha’is, Alison Norgate, sang one of the popular settings of the Baha’i writings ‘Blessed is the Spot’, to much applause. Introduced as ‘The Heart of Rathlin’, Poet Mary Cecil read three of her poems beginning with The Poets Dream.The Northern Ireland Baha’i Community has worked hard to put the province on the map and the new film by the Baha’i International Community focused on the work being done.A section of the film Dawn of the Light’ was introduced by one of its stars, Jamie Anderson from Belfast. The film is now available on YouTube. The last and perhaps the most entertaining section was traditional Irish music by the Bellaghy Music Group under the leadership of Leo Neeson.Everyone went away energised and happy. It was a glorious night made possible by the hard working staff of the HomePlace and all the participants. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

DUG states: “University provision is necessary to transform this. In the past three decades, Ireland’s other ‘Atlantic Coast’ cities - Cork, Galway and Limerick – have seen their student numbers soar in tandem with their local economies. “Derry Strabane has a total population of ,, with a third-level student population of, at best, ,. “Corkhas a population of , and, with the opening of a new campus in , will have a third-level student population of approximately , – ten times that of the North West. It has an outstanding reputation for its cultural, tourism and recreational facilities.”It says that Derry  Strabane Council’s Strategic Growth Plan is “entirely dependent” on university expansion which doesn’t seem to be forthcoming, with Derry’s student numbers, “already the worst on the island”, dropping again.Cold water has also been poured on Magee expansion by Head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, when he cast doubt over the long-promised Medical School build.Meanwhile, figures published by the Department for the Economyshow , NI students were in higher education in England, Scotland or Wales in  - a ten-year high.And according to the latest statistics, Derry Strabane is the only region of the North that is a net exporter of its young people.“UU has categorically failed to make any progress on its  promise to have , students at Magee by ,” the DUG says. googletag.cmd.push Curriculum Courses at a new independent university must, the group says, offer as broad an academic programme as is practical, reflecting the traditions, strengths and specialisms of the region within its curricula.Therefore, it envisages a full syllabus boasting courses in Medicine, Law, IT, Engineering, Arts, Commerce, but also specialise in and promote courses which are unique to Derry.Long-standing engineering traditions, evident in the City Walls and homegrown engineering companies such as EI, Seagate and InVistashould be reflected.In terms of innovation, Derry currently houses two science parks, conducting research in Articial Intelligence, robotics, virtual augmented reality. “It was the first Irish city to partner with MITto pursue research into D printing, currently running a number of Fab-Labs in schools and communities. “Thousands of people work in IT business support in the North West, with Pramerica employing , people in North Donegal.”There would also be courses in Irish History with Derry being Ireland’s longest continuously inhabited Christian settlement, and the region once home to a number of High Kings in the Middle Ages. These would be complemented by courses in Marine Military History.As a region “bursting with creative talent” Arts, Drama and Music courses are also high on the agenda.The document cites Derry’s reputation as an international leader in modern literature and conflict resolution - with Nobel laureates in both disciplines.Literature  Philosophy, Conflict Resolution  Trauma Relief, Conflict Journalism and Tourism  Heritage are amongst a plethora of subjects synonymous with the city which could be taught at an independent university. Bridging the border The DUG believes there is an urgent need to mitigate against Brexit by ‘bridging the border’ with a new independent university in the North West, recognised and supported by both the Irish EU and British governments, which would have “the freedom and autonomy to serve, andin, both jurisdictions.“Such a facility, centred in Derry, would immediately establish a partnership with the existing Letterkenny Institute of Technology, less than  miles away. The parent university could apply to become a constituent member of both the National University of Ireland and Universities UK. “This would allow it to benefit from both organisations’ administrative expertise. Formal links with southern institutions would, moreover, solidy the European identity of Northern students and, post Brexit, would help protect the rights of Irish citizens in the North as per the Good Friday Agreement.“It is time to renew and regenerate our powerful scholastic legacy. It is time to repudiate the Lockwood Report and correct this historical travesty by immediately establishing a new, independent university.”The Derry University Group has lobbied London, Dublin and US government officials calling for the establishment of a new city-region university. It has made presentations to the Irish government calling for the new university to become a constituent of the National University of Ireland. The group has received official recognition from Derry City and Strabane District Council and the international Derry-Donegal diaspora association Futureproof North West.In , following visits to the North West by the British Labour peer Andrew Adonis and frontbench MPs Mike Amesbury and Mike Kane, Lord Adonis told the Upper House that the decision to deny Derry a standalone university was a “scandal”. He also called for a review of Higher Education provision in the North which has since been published.

Stephen’s family accepted a request from the College to rename the Year  Class League, which Stephen had been a winning captain of in , in Stephen’s memory.  Presentation of the Shield with Conor Glass, the Quinn family and organiser Mr William McAteer.  The traditional setting of the day of the Halloween holidays has since become Stephen Quinn Shield Final day. As ever this year’s final was a very exciting final, battled out by two teams who had met in the group stages when Pt had come out on top in a high scoring encounter. googletag.cmd.push With the full Year  cohort of pupils giving excellent support Ti opened brightly with Dara O’Kane, Daragh O’Neill and Ruairi Biggs all to the fore. Ryan McGrath was excellent in goals while Danny Mc Goldrick was very solid in defence. Pt though worked their way back in to the game after the early onslaught and as the half wore on they had a lot of play but couldn’t manage to get the crucial scores, despite hitting the woodwork on two occasions and seeing two other goal chances go agonisingly close to the major they needed. Daire Hull, Leon Woods, Jack Rodgers and Corie McKay were proper driving forces for the underdogs while Dara Hassan was excellent in goals but the absence of Padraig O Kane from full back was a huge loss to their team. This was more keenly felt as the underdogs tired through the second-half and it was Ti who finished strongly to send joint captains Dara O’Kane and Daragh O’Neill up to collect the much coveted Stephen Quinn Shield. The Quinn family were present to hand over the Shield and they were joined by another previous winning captain of the event and St Patrick’s legend, Conor Glass, revisiting the St Mary Building while on holidays from his professional career with Hawthorn in Australia. “The College would like to thank the Quinn family for their unwavering support of the event and for being in attendance to do the presentation,” commented Paul Hughes. “Thanks also to Mr William McAteer who organised and ran a fantastic event and to Conor Glass for attending the event. Finally of course a huge well done to all the Year  pupils who took part over many lunch times in the past few weeks.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A spokesperson for Void gallery said: Jarman’s apocalyptic, postcolonial depictions of the ‘fall of England’ - reflecting the country’s desire toto its ‘Imperial days’ - are ever present in the current political landscape, from Brexit, parliamentary suspensions and the absence of a government at Stormont, to the rise of nationalism, fascism and state surveillance. We are at an impasse in Northern Ireland and are once again at the mercy of Westminster decision-making. googletag.cmd.push The film references the AIDS epidemic and the collective trauma that was experienced at that time. It was originally going to be titledGBH The Last Of England,reflecting the destruction of the landscape and culture of England, and more personally the body through AIDS. Jarman said the GBH could stand for “whatever you want it to: grievous bodily harm, great British horror, gargantuan bloody H-bomb”. Instead, he used the GBH title for his painting series, depicting the map of England in ious stages of being inflamed.In exhibiting these works,it punctuates this particular moment in Britians political history, to show the parallels in the political struggle from then and now. The legacy of Jarman’s work and gay rights activists both past and present are demonstrated in recent societal and legislative changes with the legalisation of gay marriage in the North.

It paves the way for the Council to engage formally with Central Government to request financial assistance to secure the sustainability of the City of Derry Airport beyond  March . At the meeting, members agreed toapprove a maximum additional underwrite of funding for CODAbetween now and st March  of poundk from in-year capital savings. The total funding required to ensure the airport can continue to operate beyond st March  is a sum of almost poundm per annum. This requirement includes continued operating subsidy , London PSO subvention as well as capital costs to ensure compliance with aviation regulations. googletag.cmd.push Councillors heard how the City of Derry Airport while facing a number of challenges, currently offers customers five key routes across the UK including London, Glasgow and Manchester, Edinburgh and Liverpool providing better connectivity than ever for both businesses and visitors to the region. The Airport, a key employer that positively impacts on local economy through business productivity and tourism and provides an overall estimated annual GVA to the NI economy of pound.m, is working very proactively on route development to build on this foundation and improve links to the North West to open up the gateway to the City and Region. Members of the committee heard in detail about the signicant amount of work done to secure Government support up to the end of March , and how additional Government funding for a minimum six-year period would assist in retaining this connectivity to key destinations in the UK beyond the  March , while essential rail infrastructure investment across the North West is progressed, in particular the A and A. It was outlined to members that the rationale for additional support for the airport would further consolidate the work that has gone into developing the airport and further developing its potential as a vital link within Ireland, the UK and Europe. The move will protect investment in the region, build confidence in our ability to deliver as a centre for business and promote further interest in the North West. Members were told that ultimately the main objective of Council and its strategic partners is the growth and development of the City and Region. The airport has a pivotal role to playcontributing to the delivery of a number of priorities outlined in a series of key relevant government strategies including the draft Programme for Government, Regional Development Strategy, draft Industrial Strategy for Northern Ireland and the ROI National Development Plan . Members were informed how UK Government funding subvention for the PSO route from Derry to London is currently provided at % until March  but will reduce to % thereafter. Council would not have the financial resources to bear this additional cost beyond that point and the full support of Government or Governments for the continued operation of the Airport beyond March  is required. The Council Chief Executiveoutlined to Members the need for Government to work with the Council to provide additional financial support in the form of continued % PSO subvention as well as operational and capital funding support for the Airport post  to ensure its medium term viability in providing continual connectivity to London and other key UK destinations. Members of the committee heard of the current financial challenges being faced by the Airport. Reduced passenger numbers have had a substantial impact on income and changes to flight schedules has resulted in the airport to stay open longer, which has in turn had an impact on the operational costs. Other challenges include - Air Passenger Dutyof pound the single issue affecting growth in the UK and particularly NI Route development, which is directly linked to APD because the heavy tax burden imposed by APD, makes it more attractive for carriers to start up new routes where. The signicant Central Government funding provided to airports in other regions of the UK and Ireland to ensure the sustainability and operation of small regional airports, the current global economic crisis including the lowering of disposable income, high fuel costs and lowering the tendency to fly and the uncertainty around Brexit. It was outlined how European Commission state aid guidelines acknowledge that under current market conditions airports operating under , passengers are experiencing dficulty covering operational costs. Members of the Committee also agreed that Council underwrite an additional sum up to pound, to keep the City of Derry operational to March  as an interim measure to allow the Airport to operate whilst engagement continues with Government. Members were informed that this additional subvention would be allocated from in-year capital savings and therefore have no recurring impact on rates. Members were informed that this additional support will also directly protect up to  jobs at the airport, a further  jobs through indirect and induced employment and a further  jobs through catalytic impacts of business productivity and tourism and provides an overall estimated annual GVA to the NI economy of pound.m and that said despite the challenges, intensive cost saving measures carried out by the Airport Board over the past number of months were not sufficient to mitigate against these pressures and an increased subvention was necessary. Members were also advised that moving beyond , it is hoped that the proposed formal engagement with Central Government in relation to contributions towards ongoing revenue costs would allow Council’s current funding to substantially reduce with associated savings then being available for other key strategic projects identied in the Council’s Strategic Inclusive Growth Plan. It was outlined at the meeting how the Strategic Inclusive Growth Plan -  recognises that highly effective transport infrastructure is vital for the economy and the integral role played by City of Derry Airport in making Derry-Londonderry and the wider North West City Region a more attractive and competitive proposition for inward investors. Its importance in terms of the development and growth of the region’s tourism potential, whilst also delivering economic and social benefits to local communities and the North-West region as a whole, were relayed to members. Members were informed how a key action highlighted within the Strategic Plan is improved connectivity and frequency of flights from City of Derry Airport to major business hubs. The development and sustainability of the Airport and the need for support from government for City of Derry Airport to help the development of new routes, improve connectivity and boost economic growth for the wider city region by increasing access, is also included in the Strategic Growth Plan. The proposals agreed by members are subject to ratication by Full Council later in the month.

Members of the Committee also agreed that Council underwrite an additional sum up to pound, to keep the City of Derry operational to March  as an interim measure to allow the Airport to operate whilst engagement continues with Government. Members were informed that this additional subvention would be allocated from in-year capital savings and therefore have no recurring impact on rates. Members were informed that this additional support will also directly protect up to  jobs at the airport, a further  jobs through indirect and induced employment and a further  jobs through catalytic impacts of business productivity and tourism and provides an overall estimated annual GVA to the NI economy of pound.m and that said despite the challenges, intensive cost saving measures carried out by the Airport Board over the past number of months were not sufficient to mitigate against these pressures and an increased subvention was necessary. Members were also advised that moving beyond , it is hoped that the proposed formal engagement with Central Government in relation to contributions towards ongoing revenue costs would allow Council’s current funding to substantially reduce with associated savings then being available for other key strategic projects identied in the Council’s Strategic Inclusive Growth Plan. It was outlined at the meeting how the Strategic Inclusive Growth Plan -  recognises that highly effective transport infrastructure is vital for the economy and the integral role played by City of Derry Airport in making Derry-Londonderry and the wider North West City Region a more attractive and competitive proposition for inward investors. Its importance in terms of the development and growth of the region’s tourism potential, whilst also delivering economic and social benefits to local communities and the North-West region as a whole, were relayed to members. Members were informed how a key action highlighted within the Strategic Plan is improved connectivity and frequency of flights from City of Derry Airport to major business hubs. The development and sustainability of the Airport and the need for support from government for City of Derry Airport to help the development of new routes, improve connectivity and boost economic growth for the wider city region by increasing access, is also included in the Strategic Growth Plan. The proposals agreed by members are subject to ratication by Full Council later in the month.

Under a ‘totting-up’ system, a driver who accumulates  or more penalty points within a three year period is liable to be disqualied from driving for six months. If they are disqualied a second time, they cannot drive for a year.However, the Driver and Vehicle Agency say that it “does not have the power to disqualy a person from driving” and that “a disqualication can only be ordered by the court.” This means that motorists can remain on the road despite having a large number of penalty points.In response to an Freedom of Informationrequest from the County Derry Post, the Driver and Vehicle Agencyrevealed that ten drivers in the county have  penalty points on their licence, one motorist have  and two drivers have  points. The DVA has not revealedall  drivers have been disqualied. Recent figures have shown that more than , motorists in the UK continue to drive with  or more penalty points. This includes a -year-old Burnley woman who has  points on her licence, a -year-old Kent man with  points and a Bradford manwho has the worst record in the UK with  penalty points. Road safety charity IAM RoadSmart says that it has been calling for the government to take action on this issue for six years and is “highly concerned” at the number of motorists that remain on the road with so many penalty points.Neil Greig, IAM RoadSmart director of policy and research, said that action must be taken “to get irresponsible and dangerous drivers off our roads.” “Licences need to be removed and drivers who have committed repeat offences encouraged to take remedial courses to bring home the impact of the impact of their behaviour and promote safer, more responsible driving behaviour in future,” he said. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Well vote to stop corporations from polluting the planet. All the establishment parties in the North are complicit in implementing Tory policies through Stormont. They voted to bring in vicious welfare reforms. They voted to cut taxes on corporations. They refused to undo Tory anti-trade union laws. “They have overseen the privatisation of the NHS, the running down of our schools, the destruction of the Housing Executive and disastrous environment policies. They assisted the DUPs effort to block equality for women and LGBT+ community. “Establishment parties here cant be trusted to end Tory rule. They cant be trusted to stand up to corporations and climate polluters. They cant be trusted to stand up for ordinary people. Cllr Harkin concluded: “On December  Vote Shaun Harkin in to get Boris Johnson and the Tories out.” Councillor Harkin contested the constituency at the last General Election in  and polled , votes. His selection brings to three the total of confirmed candidates for the Foyle constituency, joining sitting MP Elisha McCallion and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.

New projects this year included social prescribing mdash helping people who present to their local GP to get out and about in their local area.New investment in multi-disciplinary teams in GP practices in Down was now being rolled out to the rest of Newry and Mourne. He said the Network was central to that roll-out and CDRCNrsquos experience of social prescribing made the organisation a great source of referrals to local community activities.Cllr Casey said CDRCN along with Community Advice and other umbrella support organisations were key to the delivery of Council services.

We are being terrorised in our homes and our property is being damaged.Mrs Smyth said it was almost impossible to report incidents to the police.ldquoIf we can get through the police often donrsquot respond, she continued. ldquoThese temporary gates have been being put up for almost two years now. Torn down and put up again. Itrsquos the residents who suffer, not the council people for delays in signing off on the workthat needs to be done.The residents are being supported by local Independent councillor Cadogan Enright, who accused the council of being ldquonot exactly on top of their game.He said: ldquoThe need for fences and gates to make the area into a cul-de-sacs was triggered by an emergency situation where pensioners were and still are under siege by a small number of nersquoer-do-wells, culminating with the actual burning down of a pensionerrsquos cottage.ldquoThe council have not been treating this as an emergency. Were it not for the Housing Executive repeatedly replacing the eight temporary steel and wood barriers week after week when they are torn down, the area would be unviable as an area where pensioners can live.He added: ldquoI have proposed a workshop between the social partners led by the PSNI, Housing Executive, council and other partners to agree in detail a step-by-step process for gating orders in writing so that we never again have such a series of dreadful delays.A spokesman for the council said last night: Newry, Mourne and Down District Council can advise that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has applied to the council for gating orders in the Model Farm area and that the Council is currently following gating order guidance produced by the Department of the Environment.ldquoThis process requires consultation with the Department for Infrastructure and members of the public in the area.

We will eventually cover all old estates, subject to continuing funds and satisfactory contracts.Movements have already been made with the awarding of a number of pre-paint repair contracts and work on all contracts should begin by March or April next year.More programmes of maintenance work are being prepared and will be starting in the - financial year, subject to the approval of the Executiversquos Board.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Uncertainty has surrounded the recent proposals to establish units for educationally sub-normal pupils at Castlewellan.The South Eastern Education and Library Board give approval in January for two new units to be set up at the local controlled primary school.However, plans were revised when the neighbouring school, St Malachyrsquos Primary, decided it wanted to have special ESN units.Board officers decided thatan ESN unit is established at St Malachyrsquos the demand for ESN facilities at Castlewellan Primary mightand therefore only one unit might be necessary at each school.But confusion arose when the Board placed advertisements in a local newspaper about the plans to establish the units.Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, was unsure about whether or not the Board had changed its policy and was intended to establish the units at St Malachyrsquos instead of at the controlled school.Mrs Smyth, who has raised the matter on several occasions, told Board members, this week that she was aggrieved about the whole affair and thought that Board officers had acted in a ldquovery surreptitious manner.ldquoThis sort of thing raises suspicions in the community and itrsquos just not good enough,: said Mrs Smyth.However, she was assured by Board chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, that Board officers had not acted in an underhand manner and that there had only been a misunderstanding.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh priest had called this week for people to follow the example of friendship shown by more than  Protestants and Roman Catholics who joined together in a special Halloween dinner and concert organised by his church.He is Fr Hugh OrsquoHagan and he was speaking hours after  senior citizens had enjoyed a dinner and concert in St Maryrsquos Hall, organised by the hall management committee.Speaking afterwards Fr OrsquoHagan said that Killyleagh and Shrigley had a unique community, ldquo everywhere has like here, Northern Ireland would be a more peaceful place.Invitations to Thursdayrsquos dinner and concert went out to both sides of the community and Fr OrsquoHagan stressed that he hoped no senior citizen had been forgotten, either Protestant or Roman Catholic.The idea of the dinner mdash which was such a success last year, when he was held for the first time mdash has been widely praised in the town, especially by the senior citizens and Thursday nightrsquos was no exception, with many voting it a big hit.Before the dinner began, Fr OrsquoHagan mdash who has been priest in Killyleagh for over  years and who is the longest serving priest ever in the town mdash welcomed everyone and thanked them for coming.He welcomed especially, the three ministers in the town, the Rev J C Boggs, Rev J D Mark and Rev R E Conn.

preparing to import the generic drug from South America as part of a CF Buyers Club of families.In a desperate attempt to start their son on the drug as quickly as possible, the couple and their family fundraised around pound, to buy Lorcaacuten three months treatment.ldquoWe were so close to getting the generic drug ourselves and that would have been great as Lorcaacuten would have started on it, but we would have still been campaigning and pushing for it, said Jen.ldquoWe have been told that the Department of Health want to copy what NHS England did and get the drug into peoplersquos

and will feature classic songs such as Any Dream Will Do and Close Every Door To Me.Such success has been long on the cards for the Crossgar man who distinguished himself as one of the upcoming stars

Declan has lived with locked-in syndrome ever since.A video of Mark singing Take Him Home from the musical Les Miserables to Declan went viral in , landing him a spot on The Nolan Show.The emotional rendition of the song, which touches Declan and his parents every time they hear it, and the simple story of the brothersrsquo love and devotion, led to further performances for Mark on RTE.However, it wasnrsquot until this June that he won hearts as the runner-up in Britainrsquos Got Talent.His performance wowed judge Simon Cowell who told him it was the best performance of the series.Despite losing out to  year-old Cha Pensioner Colin Thackery, Markrsquos showcase on the hit show led to musical producers noticing his talent and superb voice.The McMullan family managed to keep the exciting news quiet until last week.Father John explained: ldquoMark was approached by the producer several months ago but we couldnrsquot really say anything.

The choral society gave me a taste for musical theatre and my mum really pushed me to do it.

Leading a presentation on Agriculture and Agri-food, Craig Humes highlighted how dairy farmers will be one of the main farming groups to be ldquostruck by Brexit.ldquo. billion litres of milk are collected from across Northern Irish farms each year.  per cent of this milk produced is then exported south to be processed.ldquoThis could make le extremely dficult for farmersexport tarfs are to be introduced, Craig shared, adding that Dr. Mike Johnston, Chief Executive of the Dairy Council Northern Ireland believes that milk prices could drop by  pence per litre should a no-deal Brexit proceed with such excessive tarfs announced.ldquoIn my opinion, to put it quite simply, dairy farmers will not survive in Fermanagh unless there is a deal, commented Craig.In her presentation on Tourism and Hospitality Rebekah Starrett noted how Fermanagh had over , visitors last year who spent an average of pound. million.ldquoThis is a massive amount of money being spent in this local economy. The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things. Brexit has taught me the importance of ensuring that my opinion and voice is heard, especially, when I wasnrsquot the age to vote in the  referendum.ldquoWhilst much of what happens around Brexit is beyond our control one thing for sure is that the potential impact will affect all of our lives. Whatever that may be, it is important that we as students embrace it and make the most of it, he added.Will Greenaway closed the conference by reiterating the potential benefits that could come from Brexit and potential concerns that leaving the EU could have on us in Northern Ireland and especially in Fermanagh.ldquoOur generation of students represent the future of Northern Ireland we are potentially the next generation of business leaders, health care workers and entrepreneurs.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Almost % of the people of South Belfast voted to remain in the EU and it is vital that a pro-Remain MP is ed.“This is a first-past-the-post election and Claire Hanna is best placed to take the South Belfast seat from the incumbent pro-Brexit MP based on previous results.”She added: “Claire Hanna and I have worked well together across a range of issues as South Belfast MLAs and Claire shares my strong pro-Remain credentials.”The development is a blow to Alliance’s Paula Bradshaw because she and Ms Hanna were attempting to persuade voters that they were best placed to defeat the DUP, thus hoping to win tactical votes from the other’s supporters.It is not clear whether the Greens’ announcement is the end of the pacts and quasi-pacts which have unfolded over recent days.The DUP was the first to stand aside, when on Saturday leader Arlene Foster announced that her party would not contest Fermanagh-South Tyrone and instead endorse the UUP’s attempt to take the seat from Sinn Fein.That was followed on Sunday by the incoming UUP Steve Aiken, who just nine days earlier had categorically pledged to stand in all  constituencies, announcing that his party would stand aside in North Belfast in favour of the DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds, who is facing a stf challenge from Sinn Fein.Jeffrey Donaldson: The SDLP must clarythe Shankill bomber Sean Kelly is welcome to canvass for them as well as for Sinn Fein Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"On Sunday night the SDLP shocked many observers when it announced that it was standing aside in key constituencies.The party said that it would not run in North Belfast, helping Sinn Fein’s attempt to topple Mr Dodds, as well as in East Belfast and North Down.That was reciprocated on Monday with a statement from Sinn Fein that it would stand aside in South Belfast as well as in East Belfast and North Down.However, some of the strains and potential contradictions in the de facto alliances yesterday began to emerge.The DUP put pressure on the SDLP over the news that Shankill bomber Sean Kelly has been campaigning for Sinn Fein’s John Finucane in North Belfast. DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said: “Sean Kelly has been canvassing for Sinn Fein in North Belfast but will he now be canvassing on behalf of the SDLP too  “I accept everyone can have a past and can change but Sean Kelly has shown no remorse for murdering nine innocent people, including two children. Do the SDLP endorse his involvement in support of their pact ”However, the SDLP insisted that it had not entered a pact with Sinn Fein, despite standing aside in favour of a Sinn Fein candidate. A spokesman said: “This election is about Remain v Leave but the DUP want it to be a sectarian Green v Orange fight which the SDLP will play no part in. The truth is that it was the DUP’s William McCrea who shared a  with loyalist killer Billy Wright, it was Arlene Foster who was happy to be pictured with Dee Stitt and just last week the DUP leadership was briefing loyalist paramilitaries on Brexit.“Jeffrey Donaldson should clarythe DUP plans to meet loyalist paramilitaries or paramilitary groups in the coming weeks to shore up electoral support and support for their hard Brexit position.

I was shocked by his deliberate isive rhetoric that is stoking anger.Even his own MPs were shocked at his attempt to claim the memory of Jo Cox in support for his demand to leave by October  regardless of the consequences.Describing death threats to MPs as humbug was a new low.Wersquore roughly a month away from potentially crashing out of the EU with no deal on October  and wersquore none the wiser as to how Boris Johnson plans to answer some of the major issues we face.The Prime Minister and his Brexit extremists donrsquot care the damaging impact that a no deal exit would have on our people, on jobs and public services.I have been very clear and consistent about the damage that a no deal Brexit would do.Letrsquos not forget, the people of Cardf South and Penarth voted overwhelmingly to Remain in the  EU Referendum.I will continue to work within my party and across political parties to ensure we arenrsquot dragged out of the EU without a deal against our will.Each day I meet with doctors, nurses, clinicians and patients who are genuinely concerned about the impact of a no deal Brexit on our NHS.Earlier this week I updated the Senedd on how health and social care across Wales are preparing for a no deal Brexit.I agreed to spend poundm of NHS Wales funds to purchase and stockpile essential medical supplies and equipment.To give some context, that poundm could have paid for seven replacement MRI scanners instead.I cannot overstate how much of my time has been taken up on no deal preparation.There is a huge amount of time energy and effort being spent on preparing for the worst possible outcome for our country.That is time energy and effort that should be going into improving health and care services for our staff and the people that they serve.This is not what the people voted for.We have to be honest with ourselves and the public - there is no easy answer to the Brexit farce.That includes my preferred answer of referendum, remain and reform of the EU.The recently announced plan by the Prime Minister to have customs checks in Ireland is a real threat to peace and security.That is not normal.The customs checks that would slow down goods including food and medicines are not normal.The prospect of a Prime Minister breaking the law ndash again ndash at the end of this month to deliver no deal is far from normal.I know any people are tired of Brexit but this is the biggest issue of our generation.Unless we put it back to the people in a referendum then I do not believe we will ever resolve our future within Europe and the UK. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan.

This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey. APCOA sees this investment as strengthening their position in Northern Ireland and providing a  for increased growth.Combining the existing APCOA expertise and customer base across both countries, this acquisition now makes APCOA a leading mobile parking operator in cashless parking providing convenient, cashless and cost-effective payment options to nearly , parking customers.Both APCOA and NCPS see this as a real opportunity to broaden the strength of services to clients and to improve capabilities by bringing together the best knowledge, systems and operational practice. Kim Challis, regional managing director for APCOA UK  Ireland, said: “The businesses complement each other well across dferent geographies and business sectors and both have strong management and operational teams.  “There are opportunities to share innovation and technology solutions from both companies across the whole business, and also to benefit from the on-going investment and business experience that comes from APCOA UK  Ireland being part of a larger European group. We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year. With every acquisition, we have pursued a clear strategy: not to become a property owner. Thanks to its consistent ‘asset light’ business model, APCOA has established itself as a reliable partner, maximising the value of both private and public property owners’ assets. “At the same time, APCOA offers consumers a range of products and services that are increasingly digital and that span the entire market.” These acquisitions have enabled APCOA to expand its presence in each market and position itself for further profitable growth. APCOA Parking Group has almost  years of industry expertise. With its , employees, the company manages approximately . million inidual parking spaces at more than , locations in  European countries. These include parking spaces at , city and shopping centre locations,  hotels,  hospitals and  European airports.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/WEB2.jpg","title":"danske bank the top team shaping the future","story":"Posted on Tuesday November  by Ulster Business Kevin Kingston, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett speak to John Mulgrew Danske Bank has made a big move in creating two deputy chief executiveroles to help boost business, engagement and further bolster a strong public face for the organisation. Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
