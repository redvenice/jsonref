We\u0027re looking forward to working with Ramsay, who\u0027s been making food and travel documentaries for well over a decade, to share the series when it premieres sometime next year.\u0027Production is scheduled to begin this fall, and an official premiere date has not been announced.

The move, published on Monday, will see the new political wing become responsible for \u0027military-patriotic\u0027 work within the Russian ArmyThe defence ministry did not release details of the new directorate, but an unnamed military source told the Kommersant daily that Kartapolov would also be responsible for the activities of the Yunarmiya, a patriotic military youth organisation sponsored by the ministry.After Russia\u0027s 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u0027s Crimea, seen by the Kremlin as a big success, the military has grown increasingly influential in domestic and foreign policy, especially in Syria.The Bolsheviks, wary of the army\u0027s loyalty, introduced political commissars in 1918. In the late Soviet period, political officers, known as \u0027zampolity\u0027, tried to ensure soldiers knew their communist doctrine and where their loyalties lay.

In the Soviet era, the directorate in practice worked in the interests of the Communist Party\u0027s central committee. \u0027It\u0027s not completely clear what military-political work the resurrected directorate will do and more importantly in the interests of which political party.\u0027Others wondered whether the creation of the new directorate was the start of a wider renaissance in ideological education that would draw in schools and colleges, and whether the new instrument would be used to root out young soldiers deemed as too pro-Western.\u0027All of this is reminiscent of a gradual return to the USSR,\u0027 wrote Dmitry Drize, Kommersant\u0027s deputy editor."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/31/14/4EB733F600000578-0-image-m-100_1533044661275.jpg","title":"Boy loses three fingers mobile phone explodes hand India","story":"    V Jagan Achari\u0027s right hand was left horrifically disfigured after the accident in India          The youngster had been listening to music on a Chinese-made device while it was chargingJagan\u0027s father V Maddilety Achari came running after hearing his son\u0027s screams.After seeing his injuries, he took him to Pathikonda Government Hospital and he was later referred to the Kurnool General Hospital. Four-month-old baby is snatched from its mother\u0027s arms by a...Share this articleIn pictures, three of the fingers on Jagan\u0027s right hand appear to have been seriously injured - while a forth seems to have been ripped from its socket.He also suffered burns to his stomach, but is said to be in a stable condition, according to local media reports.           The Chinese-made handset (pictured) reportedly heated up before exploding in the boy\u0027s hand           The youngster also suffered burns to his stomach, but is said to be in a stable condition          After seeing his injuries, the boy\u0027s father took him to Pathikonda Government Hospital and he was later referred to the Kurnool General HospitalDoctors are reportedly considering using surgery to reattach the youngster\u0027s fingers to his hand.    \u0027I was listening to music on my mother\u0027s phone while sitting on the bed,\u0027 Jagan told doctors.\u0027Suddenly, the phone burst into pieces, making a huge sound.

Six hundred users had said they would attend  Eye of the storm: Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg\u0027s social network said it had found a new attempt to meddle in the U.S. elections - this time the mid-terms which will be seen as a referendum on President Donald Trump          Anti-Trump event: This was one of the around 30 fake events created by the fake accounts exposed by Facebook Tuesday          Actual protest: This was the anti-Trump and \u0027anti-fascist\u0027 event in Times Square which the fake account promoted. Facebook did not provide the date of the fake account\u0027s post, meaning it is impossible to know if it was the first to suggest it or was repeating calls made elsewhere          Memes: The fake accounts created pages which were clearly designed to be shareable. By reacting to them, genuine users prompted the pages to show up in their own timelines, meaning that their friends would then also see them          Protest: The \u0027reSisters\u0027 page said \u0027The Trump regime is illegitimate\u0027 and was one of a series of profiles revealed by Facebook on TuesdayAmong the new accounts were one called \u0027Resisters\u0027 which promoted a fake anti-right wing protest in August in Washington D.C. It said 2,600 people had expressed interest in the event, with 600 planning to attend the protest at a park close to the White House. Other promoted anti-Trump memes, including one calling for him to resign, while others were related to African-American and Native American movements.One encouraged participation in a demonstration against fascism in Times Square last November.Hundreds of people turned up for the event, but it was widely advertised on other profiles, and it is unclear if the fake account was the one which started the event. \u0027This kind of behavior is not allowed on Facebook because we don\u0027t want people or organizations creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they are, or what they\u0027re doing,\u0027 Facebook said in a posting.During a conference call Tuesday, Facebook executives declined to paint a broader nature of the pages, including whether they included a range of political positions. Chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said that the attempts to manipulate public opinion would likely become more sophisticated to evade Facebook´s scrutiny, calling it an \u0027arms race.\u0027\u0027This kind of behavior is not allowed on Facebook because we don\u0027t want people or organizations creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they are, or what they´re doing,\u0027 the company said in a blogpost. The Facebook exectives also did not say whether any of the activity mentioned specific candidates or politicians, and were careful to say that Facebook is not \u0027publicly\u0027 linking the activity to any group or government. But it added that it still does not know who was behind the coordinated campaign saying they had gone to great lengths to keep their true identities secret. \u0027It\u0027s clear that whoever set up these accounts went to much greater lengths to obscure their true identities than the Russian-based Internet Research Agency (IRA) has in the past,\u0027 it said.\u0027We believe this could be partly due to changes we\u0027ve made over the last year to make this kind of abuse much harder.\u0027Virginia Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, called the disclosure \u0027further evidence that the Kremlin continues to exploit platforms like Facebook to sow ision and spread disinformation.\u0027 Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, in a statement urged Facebook to move against foreign groups trying to sway American voters and to warn legitimate users that such activity, as seen in 2016, is recurring this year.\u0027Today\u0027s announcement from Facebook demonstrates what we\u0027ve long feared: that malicious foreign actors bearing the hallmarks of previously-identified Russian influence campaigns continue to abuse and weaponize social media platforms to influence the U.S. electorate,\u0027 Schiff said.  The earliest page was created in March 2017. Facebook says more than 290,000 accounts followed at least one of the fake pages. The most followed Facebook pages had names such as \u0027Aztlan Warriors,\u0027 \u0027\u0027Black Elevation,\u0027 \u0027\u0027Mindful Being,\u0027 and \u0027Resisters.\u0027Facebook didn\u0027t provide detailed descriptions of those pages. But the names it released are reminiscent of groups set up by Russian agents to draw in and manipulate Americans with particular ethnic, cultural or political identities ahead of the 2016 election. That effort targeted people with both liberal and conservative leanings.           Racial charge: Some of the material appeared to be an attempt to piggyback on tensions over race, highlighting a news story which told how Colombus Day had been canceled in Los Angeles          Created community: One fake account produced a vast number of people interested in it. It appeared to be part of an overall intention to create more racial tension  Anti-white rhetoric: Many of the examples published by Facebook were not explicitly about party politics but referenced Aztlan, the historical - or possibly mythical - home of the Aztec people. Its location is unclear but some people have placed it in the modern-day southwest United States and linked the Indian Wars to it          Also in the cache: This was one of the messages which Facebook released. It has not disclosed the entire output of the fake accounts  Also in the cache: One account was called \u0027mindful being\u0027 and the examples of its posting published by Facebook had no clear intentAmong the techniques used to cover their trails were virtual private networks, and internet phone services. None had Russian IP addresses, the unique number ever computer or server has which allows its location to be discovered.However Facebook said that it had found links to some of the Facebook pages set up by the IRA in 2016. One page, the Resisters account which was trying to organize a fake rally, had an IRA account as an administrator for eight minutes. Facebook briefed lawmakers earlier this week on the discovery the New York Times reported. The company will hold a conference call later on Tuesday.It said that 290,000 users followed at least one of the accounts.The most followed Facebook pages were \u0027Aztlan Warriors,\u0027 \u0027Black Elevation,\u0027 \u0027Mindful Being,\u0027 and \u0027Resisters\u0027, the network said. In total the accounts had 9,500 posts, all but one of them on Facebook, the other on Instagram.They paid for around 150 advertisements, at a total cost of $11,000, some of which also ran on Instagram.The ads were paid for in both U.S. and Canadian dollars, starting in April 2017 and ending in June 2018.They also created 30 fake \u0027events\u0027, with one event - which Facebook did not name - having 4,700 people saying they were interested in going, and 1,400 users saying they would attend.Because Facebook did not name the event, it is unclear if it happened or not. Washington imposed punitive sanctions on Russia following U.S. intelligence agency conclusions that Moscow interfered to undermine the 2016 U.S. elections, one of the reasons U.S.-Russian relations are at a post-Cold War low. Both U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have said, however, that they want to improve ties between the two nuclear powers.Facebook disclosed in September that Russians under fake names had used the social network to try to influence U.S. voters in the months before and after the 2016 election, writing about isive issues, setting up events and buying ads.U.S. intelligence agencies said Russian state operators ran the campaign combining fake social media posts and hacking into Democratic Party networks, eventually becoming an effort to help Republican candidate Trump, who scored a surprise victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton.Over the past several months, the company has taken steps meant to reassure U.S. and European lawmakers that further regulation is unnecessary. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg says the company has 20,000 people working to police and protect the site.Costs associated with that effort are part of the reason Facebook said last week that it expects its profit margins to decline. The revelation caps a disastrous week for Facebook, which has seen its share price plunge and billions of dollars being wiped off its total market value and the personal wealth of Mark Zuckerberg, its founder. But Facebook\u0027s share price was not affected by the announcement, going up slightly in the course of the day from its $170.67 opening.However it remains far from its peak price of $217.50 last week, which was followed by the plunge in value as it unveiled lower than expected user growth and lost $120 billion of value in just one day. Stuck in Hell until 2020: Trump Chief of Staff John Kelly...\u0027The hell with Mueller!\u0027 Fox Business host Lou Dobbs says...It IS getting harder for immigrants to gain asylum in the...Trump tweets about Mexico\u0027s record murder rate after last...Share this article"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/31/17/4EB7E9E500000578-0-image-a-5_1533055144051.jpg","title":"New pictures reveal dolphin survived extreme sunburn stranded ashore","story":"    Spirtle the bottlenose dolphin managed to survive this extreme bout of sunburn          She was stranded on shore for more than 24 hours when she suffered the sunburn          Over the past two years, Spritle\u0027s skin has managed to recover and she is behaving normallyBut new images have revealed how the six-year-old dolphin\u0027s injuries have continued to heal - more than two years later.University of Aberdeen scientists and Whale and Dolphin Conservation field officer Charlie Phillips have been monitoring her ongoing recovery.Mr Phillips took the latest image of Spirtle close to Fort George, near Ardersier, on the Moray Firth. University Challenge is at the centre of a sexism row after...Father-of-two, 37, dies in his sleep after being punched on...Share this articleDr Barbara Cheney, a research Fellow at the Lighthouse Field Station, University of Aberdeen, said: \u0027Spirtle was in a group with four other dolphins near the Sutors of Cromarty last Friday.\u0027It is difficult to know exactly how her recovery is going as we are of course judging only on photographs and her behaviour.\u0027But we weren\u0027t optimistic when we first saw her two months after the stranding in July 2016 when we saw the extent of her wound and the damage to her skin.\u0027However, since then we have been happily surprised by the progress of her healing, and when we spotted her last Friday the wound was completely healed over.\u0027Also when we saw her initially after the stranding she was often on her own, but now she is interacting more with other dolphins and her behaviour is what we would expect to see from any other six-year-old dolphin.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/31/18/4EB5938200000578-6012143-image-a-8_1533059830927.jpg","title":"The elephant thinks giraffe Animal stands hind legs reach high leaves","story":"In the delightful snaps, the big male can be seen stretching up on his back legs while reaching out for leaves with his trunk          Taken by Duncan Taylor while he was on a family holiday in the Kruger National Park in South Africa, the photos reflect the agility of the enormous mammalsThe behaviour is usually only seen by circus elephants and is rarely spotted in the wild.Duncan, 48, said: \u0027We were standing in the camp site and a bull elephant walked up the waterhole to get a drink of water.Stunning photos of animals in their natural settings are not...Threats to lift ban on trophy-hunting in Botswana - dubbed...Share this article\u0027It first walked to the tree, lifted its trunk to smell and then positioned itself under the branches.\u0027It then raised itself up until it was standing on its hind legs and stretched as far as it could reach with its trunk and pulled down some food to eat and then gently lowered itself to the ground.

comments come amid growing debate over whether studying for a non-vocational degree really is the best option for people who just want to get stuck into a career.For many years, schools have been directing bright pupils towards general degrees at good universities in the belief that this is the best route to a professional job – even if the skills learned have only limited use in the

difficult circumstances. \u0027Character, resilience, virtue, upstandingness – there\u0027s a lot of education in that book and a lot to be learned from that character,\u0027 he said.Gregory Peck won an Oscar for his portrayal of Finch, who defends a black man wrongly accused of rape in Alabama, in the 1962 film.                                                    \u0027For a long time, one of the

have \u0027real currency\u0027 in industry, said Mr Hinds. \u0027Our goal is that all young people, whatever their background, will have much better choices when they start thinking about their post-16 and post-18 destinations,\u0027 he added.Asked later if he thought it would give these routes more credence if middle-class children took them, he replied: \u0027Yes, I do.\u0027University participation has expanded over the past few decades, but because the job market is now over-supplied with graduates, a good university degree is no longer a guaranteed passport to a skilled job.Mr Hinds also used his speech to dismiss claims that elite universities are institutionally biased against disadvantaged students. However, he acknowledged that more must be done to encourage such students to apply.He urged the elite universities of the Russell Group to \u0027reach out\u0027 to poorer pupils and do more to make sure they are admitted – for example, by making socio-economic background an admissions consideration.Mr Hinds also said disadvantaged parents should encourage their children to tackle tougher subjects because they can be a \u0027signalling device\u0027 to universities and employers that a pupil is clever."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/31/21/4EB992C100000578-0-image-m-7_1533070607126.jpg","title":"The modern family businesses run children","story":"    Family affair: Jordan Weller and his mother Julie prepare clothes for his online businesses which rakes in some £500-a-dayJordan, who lives at home with his parents in Essex, pays his mum a weekly wage of £80 to collect up to 50 items of vintage sportswear once or twice a week, which she\u0027ll wash and iron. She also prepares the quarterly report for the accountant.\u0027She takes the lead on all the things I don\u0027t have time to do\u0027, Jordan says. \u0027I could give her more work but it\u0027s difficult as the business is online and she\u0027s not very good on the computer.\u0027How to stay safe when banking and shopping online - and...Backlash! Customers furious as Nationwide axes vital phone...ASK TONY: Is TUI allowed to bill me £85 to sit with my five...Shoppers will need a special code when they pay with a card...Share this articleWhile his mum is busy preparing the stock, Jordan has more time to list the Eighties and Nineties sports gear, made by popular brands such as Adidas, Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren, on three websites: ASOS Marketplace, Depop and his own site.Having Julie on board also means he can put more energy into negotiating with suppliers across the world.These are iniduals based in Canada, Ukraine, Indonesia and Thailand, who source vintage garments and send Jordan pictures of what they pick up each day.Jordan began selling vintage clothes five years ago, when he left school aged 16. He says he was always into fashion, and knowing what people wanted wasn\u0027t difficult because he was selling to other young people with similar tastes to his own.While the business was small, Jordan was able to operate alone from his parents\u0027 house. But when sales took off, he quickly found he needed more space.\u0027There were cardboard boxes everywhere and we were getting in the way of each other,\u0027 Jordan says. \u0027There was so much stock in the house and I knew my Mum and Dad didn\u0027t like it.\u0027Jordan found a unit in East Tilbury, a 15-minute drive from his parents\u0027 house. It serves as an office, photography studio and stockroom for 1,000 vintage garments.He now rakes in around £500 a day, of which £350 is profit. His best return was on a pair of Nike Air Max trainers, which he bought on eBay for 99p and sold for £80.He says his mum saw the potential in his business from the start and was keen to get involved.For the most part Jordan says he and his mum get on like a \u0027house on fire\u0027, but he admits they still bicker from time to time.\u0027She takes the job seriously, but I\u0027m a perfectionist,\u0027 he says. \u0027If she makes a mistake I\u0027m always like, \u0027Oh Mum\u0027!\u0027Julie seconds this: \u0027I\u0027ll do something one way and he\u0027ll say, \u0027Not quite like that, Mum\u0027. But you know what, it\u0027s his business and I\u0027m here to help.\u0027He\u0027s built this up over the last five years and I\u0027m really proud of him.\u0027Dimitrios Tsivrikos, a consumer and business psychologist at University College London, says enterprising young people such as Jordan dispel the myth that all millennials want success handed to them on a plate.But he cautions that, while the internet has created a world of opportunities, this comes with downsides. For example, it can be hard to know where to start or how to make a success of a business as a young person. That\u0027s where parents and grandparents are filling the void.\u0027Unlike their parents, many of whom had a fairly prescribed route to success, with plenty of examples to follow, young people today are navigating untrodden paths as online entrepreneurs,\u0027 Dr Tsivrikos says.SEVEN-YEAR-OLD SISTER MODELS CLOTHES While some relatives work away behind the scenes, others are becoming the face of the modern family business.          Cool kid: Seven-year-old Oberta  Vodenicharova models a jumper for her sister KristinaKristina Vodenicharova decided her seven-year-old sister Oberta, known as Bertie, would be just the thing to make her brand, The Cool Kid, stand out.Kristina, 22, used to make her boyfriend Stanislav, 23, pose in the vintage sportswear she sold, but says he didn\u0027t enjoy it.After a few months, she started putting Bertie in front of the camera wearing the Eighties and Nineties Fila, Nike and Puma \u0027treasures\u0027 she finds in shops around the East Midlands. Bertie, who has long dark hair and a mischievous grin, throws herself into the work.\u0027She\u0027s very creative,\u0027 Kristina says. \u0027As soon as she\u0027s dressed she starts making faces and posing, and I take photos the whole time. She keeps changing her expression until I get the right look.\u0027While Kristina says she and her sister have a lot of fun together, working with a seven-year-old isn\u0027t without its challenges.\u0027I took her to the lake in the centre of Coventry on a photoshoot and there were ducks, which proved a big distraction,\u0027 she recalls. \u0027I told her that once we were done she could go play with the ducks, and that seemed to do the trick.\u0027Bertie has also developed a penchant for fashion, which can cause problems if she takes a liking to something that\u0027s up for sale. Kristina says she and her young assistant once had an argument because Bertie wanted to keep an Adidas crop top for herself.\u0027She said, \u0027I\u0027ve always wanted one, please, please, please\u0027. My mum said, \u0027No, she\u0027s only seven\u0027.\u0027But we ended up making a deal if it wasn\u0027t sold in two weeks she could have it. It sold straight away — she was very disappointed.\u0027Kristina, who can make up to £300 a day, sometimes gives her little sister some pocket money — £5 here and there — or takes her shopping for sweets as a thank-you treat.GRANDAD WHO\u0027S A TRAINER WHIZZDaniel Wilmot has picked a relative from the other end of the family tree to help run his online business selling rare trainers.He says his grandad Brian, 81, who was nicknamed \u0027the brain\u0027 at school, is \u0027the kind of person you\u0027d go to for advice\u0027 — and most of his family do.And Daniel, 24, says Brian\u0027s experience running a seaside sweetshop in Great Yarmouth has proved invaluable.Brian got involved with Daniel\u0027s business three years ago. He was already sourcing and selling rare trainers online while studying at Nottingham Trent University. He had planned to join the police, but decided it wasn\u0027t for him. His mum didn\u0027t have his room ready at her house in Elford, Staffordshire, so he went to stay with his grandad, whom he has always been close to.          Sole traders: Daniel Wilmot and  his grandad Brian, 81, show off pairs of rare Nike trainers He\u0027d been used to going shopping and trawling websites such as Gumtree on his own. But when he moved in with Brian, they started going out together to visit Nike stores in Birmingham.Daniel says: \u0027Grandad was recently retired and would have been sitting at home. And I\u0027d just be going out on my own.\u0027Brian took on the book-keeping while Daniel focused on purchases and sales. He turned over £40,000 in the first nine months.\u0027I was so wrapped up in the trainers I didn\u0027t think much about the books. In just a year, we\u0027d gone over the VAT threshold and I needed to be responsible.\u0027That\u0027s where my grandad really helped. We got the books out and made a list of everything we sold.\u0027Now Daniel can sell between 20 and 50 pairs of trainers a day on online marketplace Depop under the name @hookedbhm, with an average mark-up of £20.Daniel doesn\u0027t pay his grandad and says the only time they have discussed money has been in jest.\u0027Grandad used to tell his friends in the pub that he was being exploited and he\u0027d have me impounded for slave labour. But he would never take any money.\u0027Brian, whom Daniel dubs a \u0027Clarks man\u0027 for his traditional taste in shoes, has never had much interest in trainers.Daniel bought him a pair of Adidas shoes when he had a heart bypass and had to do more exercise, but says he rarely wears them. Now Brian is on the mailing list of every trainer retailer just in case they have rare shoes to sell, and keeps an eye on which ones he should be buying for the business.\u0027Grandad\u0027s really knowledgeable and knows what it takes to run a shop. He\u0027ll think of all the things I don\u0027t, such as what you\u0027re supposed to do when you want to go on holiday.\u0027Brian says: \u0027I\u0027ve only had one pair of trainers in my life and I couldn\u0027t tell you what they were.\u0027But I was interested in spending time with Daniel, who\u0027d come back from university a confident young man. He\u0027s like a mini-me — we\u0027ve got the same sense of humour and we\u0027re both very laid back.\u0027I give him support and go with him when he bulk-buys. I\u0027m also around to bounce ideas off and tell him when something sounds daft — but that\u0027s just being a grandad, really.\u0027MUM\u0027S A VINTAGE BARGAIN HUNTER  When your business revolves around the latest trends, as a millennial you might not trust your parents to know what young people want.And Natacha Petajamaa says when her mum, Mirva, first got involved in her Dark Paradise Vintage clothes business four years ago, she made a few dubious choices. Natacha, 28, says the worst item her mum picked was a long leather gothic trench coat.The conversation that followed was awkward: Natacha had to explain that the coat wasn\u0027t really the type of thing people were after and Mirva was quite upset.          Natacha Petajamaa and her mother Mirva  converted a room in her home from where her they sell vintage clothesNatacha had been selling online with a friend for a few years, starting with clothes that were gathering dust in their wardrobes and then looking for bargains in charity shops. Natacha would also sell her mum\u0027s unwanted items for her. And when Natacha\u0027s friend went away to university her mum stepped up.Natacha moved to London and Mirva offered to send the sold garments to buyers from her home. She wanted to sell her own vintage finds on the website, too, and Natacha agreed. Mirva keeps the money she makes from these sales.Natacha says her mum\u0027s tastes have improved over the years, and she rarely has to say \u0027no\u0027 any more. \u0027She found this amazing Sixties leopard print jacket at a car boot sale for £5 and we listed it online for £65,\u0027 Natacha recalls.\u0027It was snapped up straight away and we kept getting messages from people wanting it.\u0027Every weekend Natacha travels from London to her parents\u0027 three-bed house in Crowborough, East Sussex, and she and Mirva go off to trawl countryside car boot sales. They take their haul back home and store it in one of the rooms they\u0027ve converted into studio and storage space.Natacha uploads pictures of their stock on to shopping websites Depop, Etsy and ASOS Marketplace. Mirva is then responsible for communicating with customers, packing the orders and sending them. Natacha deals with the websites and social media.In total, they make £4,000 to £5,000 of sales a month — each keeping the gains from the garments they selected. They make more in winter, when they can sell expensive coats.While Natacha says her mum has become the \u0027other half\u0027 of her business, and couldn\u0027t run it without her, they\u0027re also in competition.\u0027There were occasions early on when Mum was a bit resentful if I was selling more than she was and she had to pack and send all my stuff. But you\u0027ve got to have these arguments in order to learn.\u0027Mirva says it took some time to get used to what Natacha wanted.\u0027I wore these vintage clothes the first time round,\u0027 she says. \u0027I thought anything \u0027vintage\u0027 would work. But Natacha would say they weren\u0027t fashionable and young people wouldn\u0027t like them. So what she didn\u0027t like I wore myself!\u0027Now I know what people want and your confidence grows when people appreciate your taste.\u0027Mirva says she loves working with Natacha because it keeps their relationship close.She adds: \u0027When you have children and they grow up you can grow apart.

This weekend, the judiciary announced 60 people had been arrested for fraud and trying to undermine the banking system, with more to come.Spokesman Gholam Hossein Mohseni-Ejeie said several had direct ties to the government, allowing them, for example, to illegally import luxury cars, and could face the death penalty on Iran\u0027s infamous charge of \u0027corruption on Earth\u0027.The arrests follow mounting anger against profiteers who use political connections to access dollars at artificially low rates, and then use them to import goods on the cheap, or simply sell them on the black market for a huge profit.In a radical departure from usual government practice, in June the young telecoms minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi exposed a group of mobile phone importers who were gaming the system.Israeli Arab woman is sentenced to five months in prison for...Trump \u0027enjoys watching\u0027 media go \u0027crazy\u0027 covering his...ISIS releases video of \u0027Tajik attackers\u0027 pledging allegiance...How a mother and daughter spent their last days making their...Share this articleThey had been granted $250 million at the cheap rate to import phones, he said, \u0027but less than one third was used for the purpose,\u0027 implying the rest was stashed away or sold.The 36-year-old minister\u0027s move proved wildly popular on social media, but saw a backlash from some of his cabinet colleagues such as Industry Minister Mohammad Shariatmadari, who said doing something similar in his ministry would amount to \u0027a war against the private sector\u0027.Still, the episode showed a new willingness among Iranian officials to \u0027be transparent and introduce accountability into the system,\u0027 said Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, founder of the Europe-Iran Forum, a business network.\u0027Hopefully, more officials will understand that this is what the public is looking for.\u0027The other priority is fixing the chaotic policies that have facilitated profiteering in the first place, particularly the disastrous decision in April to set a single, fixed rate for the dollar at 42,000 rials.To enforce the decision, the authorities shut down currency trading shops and made it illegal to sell dollars above the official rate, which only fuelled a boom in the black market.

Salman Abedi, who attacked the Manchester arena was rescued from Libya onboard HMS Enterprise, pictured arriving in Valetta, Malta on August 4, 2014. Abedi was among 110 Britons - including his brother Hashem - rescued from the war zone by the Royal NavyThey also demanded to know why the Abedis – British-born sons of Libyan migrants – had been allowed to visit the Middle Eastern state without apparent scrutiny and subsequently fell off the security services\u0027 radar.Robby Potter, 48, who almost died in the attack after shrapnel from the bomb punctured his heart, told the Mail: \u0027The authorities have definitely hidden this information from us. They haven\u0027t been honest. Brother of Manchester bomber \u0027tells family he is scared of...Share this article\u0027The Government should have told us straight away or it should have been in the reports. We have been left to find out through the Press.\u0027John Woodcock, the independent MP for Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, said: \u0027It is deeply concerning that the Royal Navy\u0027s role in extracting Salman Abedi has had to be uncovered by a media investigation rather than being volunteered by the British Government.          Robby Potter, pictured with his wife Leonora Ogerio. They were both wounded in the attack\u0027In particular, David Anderson QC needs to explain why he did not include this in his report into the Manchester bombing – was he kept in the dark or did he choose to hide it from the public?\u0027Either way, this undermines the important role he had as Britain\u0027s independent reviewer of terror legislation.\u0027I believe the Navy acted perfectly properly in rescuing these British citizens but unnecessary secrecy leaves the unfortunate impression that the Government has something it wants to hide.\u0027 It is understood that the Ministry of Defence was the first Whitehall department to discover that Abedi had been rescued by the Royal Navy.          Abedi was already being monitored by the security services seven months before his rescueHis name emerged on passenger lists handed to the sailors on HMS Enterprise. The information was subsequently passed on to Number Ten, the Foreign Office and the Home Office.Whitehall sources said that Abedi\u0027s rescue did not come to light in the Anderson report because it had no relevance to potential security failings.But Elkan Abrahamson, a solicitor representing relatives of victims of the bombing for the forthcoming inquests, said: \u0027The trouble with the Anderson report is that we are not allowed to see the primary sources – that is, the MI5 or other security service documents.\u0027I am sure that the security services have not told us the full story. We may need an inquiry to get at the truth.\u0027He added: \u0027Both Abedi and his brother ought to have been tracked better, there are certainly concerns around that.\u0027           The Daily Mail yesterday uncovered how Abedi was rescued by the Royal Navy from LibyaThe Anderson report revealed that Abedi was already being monitored by the security services a full seven months before the rescue and that MI5 closed his file as a result of mistaken identify a month prior to his evacuation from Libya in 2014.Senior security sources insist Abedi had not been radicalised at the time of the rescue and instead was brainwashed after watching bomb-making videos on the internet.However, other sources have claimed that Abedi was seen on the front line, fighting alongside jihadis in Ajdabiya, eastern Libya. Survivors of the atrocity said it was difficult to understand why the Abedis were not detained or monitored following the rescue on their return to the UK.Mr Potter, who was blown up while waiting for his daughter after the concert, said: \u0027The security services must have known the Abedis had gone to Libya to fight. They\u0027ve got questions to answer about why they let them back in the UK as free men.\u0027The security services should have questioned the Abedis about what they were doing in Libya, at the very least. They should have been taken back to Libya and not allowed into Britain.\u0027             Hashem Abedi, 21, brother of Manchester suicide bomber Salman Abedi has claimed he is afraid to be extradited to the UK to face terrorism charges The UK government requested his extradition last October from the United Nations-backed government in Tripoli. But the high-level negotiations appear to have stalled.And in May Libyan judicial sources told the Mail that Hashem could escape justice by refusing to face trial in the UK. His opposition to being extradited might hold weight because he has joint Libyan citizenship, a source said.Mr Salem suggested however that Hashem, who was born in Manchester to Libyan migrants, might not be able to veto any attempt to bring him to Britain. \u0027He was afraid and he didn\u0027t want the Libyan Government to hand him over to Britain,\u0027 he said. \u0027He was very scared and the matter was still very hot but the decision is not in his hands. To me it\u0027s obvious he has committed a crime in Britain – of course he wouldn\u0027t want to be handed to them.\u0027Hashem is believed to have played a key role in the attack in May last year, including helping to buy materials for the homemade bomb set off by his brother Salman.He has also been linked to a plot to kill Peter Millett, the UK\u0027s former envoy to Libya. It is alleged he was in a four-man cell planning to carry out the attack using a suicide bomb. Brother of Manchester bomber \u0027tells family he is scared of...Share this articleIt was claimed they also plotted to kill former UN envoy Martin Kobler and Libya\u0027s prime minister Fayez Al-Sarraj. Mr Salem said: \u0027This case is quite difficult, it is not going to be that easy for Hashem to be handed over. He is a Libyan citizen and yes although he is a British national as well, it is considered that he has also committed a crime here in Libya.\u0027Mr Salem said the decision over Hashem\u0027s future was for the Libyan government to decide and not his militia: \u0027The decision to hand him over is not in our hands.\u0027But he said his Special Deterrence Force unit would willingly release Hashem from its jail, which is holding around 250 Islamic State suspects, should they be asked to do so. He said: \u0027We cannot say no. What concerns us is that we want to reassure the British people.\u0027I understand so many innocent lives were lost, and the British people feel they we are not giving them the justice they are seeking because they presume that because he is a Libyan citizen and currently in Libya that we are providing him a safe haven.            Salman Abedi, pictured, murdered 22 people during a terrorism attack on the Manchester Arena \u0027On the contrary. We do want him to face justice.\u0027Our main concern is that he does face justice no matter if it is in Libya or Britain.\u0027Of Hashem\u0027s brother, he added: \u0027It is unfortunate that they had accommodated Salman for several years in their country and he has the British passport and he committed such a thing to a country that sheltered him and served him and that he would blow himself up and that he would kill innocent children.\u0027Even his own family were shocked. We met with them and have spoken to them.\u0027Mr Salem said there was enough evidence to convict Hashem, and he had \u0027confessed to everything\u0027.He added: \u0027He is facing two things. Either he is going to be tried in Libya or he is going to be tried in Britain. If the British government and the Libyan government reach an agreement for handing him over he will be then tried in Britain.\u0027He denied any suggestion that Hashem could have been tortured into confessing his role in the Manchester attack. And he said the suspect did not get his warped ideology from Libya: \u0027He was watching a lot of the videos on YouTube, watching videos of children in Iraq and Syria.\u0027The SDF has been tasked by the Tripoli government with hunting down Islamic State fighters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/874ee1381aca562c35abe94e418758d77ba47e54/148_559_1352_811/master/1352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea9307fda034a6b6873b1406c03041af","title":"bored tourists in pictures laurence stephens photography","story":"Tourist tat, tired sightseers and the fundamental absurdism of the selfie catch British photographer Laurence Stephens’s eye"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0424dbdca3077a3b7aec243599fd24b059927dc5/0_507_4119_2472/master/4119.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=849ff20b1a23ee12f9e81bd967e136b0","title":"libraries world most beautiful in pictures","story":"In a new Taschen book, the Italian photographer Massimo Listri travels around the world to some of the oldest libraries, revealing a treasure trove of unique and imaginative architecture"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8633e1224bc51641df4588ff74a91596a3859ae/0_78_4873_2924/master/4873.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc550d3dd0955affe325ed07cd303404","title":"theresa may must push for even softer brexit says thinktank","story":"Prime minister urged to offer more concessions to EU to minimise economic damageTheresa May will be forced to offer further politically difficult concessions to the EU to minimise damage to the economy caused by Brexit, said one of the UK’s leading economic thinktanks.The National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said Britain was gripped by an epidemic of uncertainty about the terms of its EU departure, and warned that the government would have to pay a bigger financial contribution or accept higher migration to get the deal it wanted.May has already lost two cabinet ministers – David Davis and Boris Johnson – after announcing plans for Brexit that involved prioritising trade in goods over services, while aiming to limit free movement of people. But in its latest quarterly health check on the economy, the NIESR said May’s version of a soft Brexit was still not soft enough. The government was aiming for market access similar to that enjoyed by Switzerland but with a much tougher migration system. “In our view, the government will have to make significant concessions to the EU,” it said.It added, however, that even these modest growth rates relied on the UK continuing to have close to full access to the EU market for its goods and services.The more limited proposals for market access in the recently published white paper would lead to a loss of output amounting to £500 per person over time, compared to a soft Brexit.“The loss would be around £800 under a ‘no deal’ Brexit. These estimates do not include the likely impact on productivity which could, on some estimates, double the size of the losses,” said the thinktank. Jagjit Chadha, director of the NIESR, said: “In the UK, uncertainty about exit from the EU seems to be limiting the development of policies to promote more inclusive growth.” Brexit, he added, was a demanding agenda that was causing political stasis. “Things are not happening that should be happening.”Chadha said pre-Brexit Britain was “gripped by an unusual amount of uncertainty, you might call it an epidemic of uncertainty – we haven’t worked out how to do it”.The NIESR said the Bank of England would need to take account of the uncertainty when setting interest rates. While supporting a quarter-point increase in official borrowing costs this week, the Bank should make it clear that it was prepared to reverse the decision, the institute added. “The UK is just eight months away from the March 2019 EU exit date and the range of outcomes remains as wide as ever. We are by no means sure that there will be a deal by then, and even if there is a deal it is not clear how policymakers, businesses and households will respond to the new arrangement. And, all along, the chance of a second referendum is rising.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27dd872ece5ff700dd9bb5703a08f10b8644daeb/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ab8fc2ef58a0c62002f10acbbe19822","title":"germanys china city duisburg became xi jinping gateway europe","story":"For much of the 20th century, the city of Duisburg in Germany’s industrial west was a steel-and-coal town whose chimneys cloaked the skies in smoke. And yet there is something about this soot-stained spot in the Ruhr valley that seems to encourage a particularly clear-sighted view of the rest of the world.In 1585, it was in Duisburg that Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator published a book of maps of European countries – the first ever “atlas” to carry that name. And it was here that Mercator first presented his new world map, the “Mercator projection”, that was so revolutionary for maritime navigators keen to steer merchant vessels across the high seas in the straightest possible line.If in 2018 Duisburg is slowly rediscovering its cosmopolitan past, it is not just because four centuries after Mercator, traders are still trying to find the most direct route from A to B. As the threat of Donald Trump’s tariffs and Brexit-related trade barriers is driving wedges between the EU and the Anglosphere, this former rust-belt town town allows one to see in real time how Germany and China are intensifying their economic ties.China’s Belt and Road Initiative is a huge, $1tn infrastructure project to better connect China – and Chinese goods – with the rest of the world. It is meant to be a 21st-century silk road, made up of a belt of overland corridors (including roads, bridges and railways) and a maritime road of shipping lanes.Its wider ambitions are harder to pin down. Is it a bid by China for world domination, or simply a move to prop up Chinese companies at home? Is there a grand strategy, or is it just a rebranding of existing projects?In\u0026nbspCities of the New Silk Road\u0026nbspwe have endeavoured to find out, by exploring the project\u0027s tangible results so far – from the newly built city of Khorgos on the Kazakhstan border to Duisburg, dubbed “Germany’s China city”. Our correspondents have reported from\u0026nbspthe “next Dubai” rising out of the sea in Sri Lanka, the nascent port of Gwadar in a restive province of Pakistan, the sleepy Tanzanian village that could be transformed into Africa’s largest port, and more.Nick Van MeadRead more: Cities of the New Silk RoadEvery week, around 30 Chinese trains arrive at a vast terminal in Duisburg’s inland port, their containers either stuffed with clothes, toys and hi-tech electronics from Chongqing, Wuhan or Yiwu, or carrying German cars, Scottish whisky, French wine and textiles from Milan heading the other way.In Duisburg’s port, where train tracks run straight to the edge of the Rhine River, goods are loaded straight on to ships, stored for further dispatch in one of several football pitch-sized storage units, or sent on by train or truck to Greece, Spain or Britain.Local politicians, while still proud of the city’s links to the 16th-century mapmaker, also like to compliment the perceptive eye of modern Chinese cartographers: in a map of Europe displayed at Shanghai airport, they point out, Duisburg’s name is printed larger than London, Paris or Berlin.“We are Germany’s China city,” says Sören Link, Duisburg’s Social Democrat mayor. For years, his city has been a symbol of the challenges of long-term structural changes facing industry in the Ruhr region: in 1987, photographs of thousands of Krupp steelworkers barricading a bridge over the Rhine protesting against imminent factory closures travelled around the world.The trains’ return journeys, however, remain Duisburg’s achilles heel. For every two full containers arriving in Europe from China, only one heads back the other way, and the port only earns a fifth of the fee from empty containers that have to be sent back to China.And while the west’s appetite for gadgets made in China shows no sign of abating, one of the main European products heading east is powdered milk – a result of low trust in domestic brands following a 2008 food safety scandal. If that trust returns, even fewer containers may be heading east from Duisburg.“The ratio used to be 4:1, so it has improved, but we still have an imbalance,” admits Erich Staake, the port’s CEO. A former TV channel manager, he is not shy to take credit for the entrepreneurial spirit of the port. Since taking charge in 1998, employment at Duisport has soared from 19,000 to 50,000.While other German port cities such as Hamburg run their harbour “like a landlord”, Staake says, Duisburg has worked to court new trade, modernising its logistics infrastructure and even setting up its own railway company. He is building a new 20,000 sq metre storage unit where China Railways will be able to neatly stack 2,000 containers.Staake’s aspiration doesn’t stop there. For Duisburg to permanently establish itself on the New Silk Road, he says, rail travel between China and Europe needs to outstrip other freight methods.“Rail freight between Chongqing and Duisburg is almost twice as expensive as shipping, but takes 12 days instead of 45. Air freight is at least twice as expensive as rail freight, but takes on average five days. If we can reduce lead times even further, below 10 days on average, then that opens up a lot more potential.”But in Germany, some have been quick to sound a note of caution. If the still-recovering industries in western Germany make themselves too reliant on China, they warn, it could provide economic leverage for an authoritarian regime that wants to project its geopolitical power into western Europe. “What’s good for Duisburg isn’t necessarily good for the world,” cautioned one recent article.For now though, China’s soft power barely registers in the region. The number of Chinese citizens living in the city has doubled in the past eight years – but from a low base of 568. The local Duisburg-Essen University houses a Confucius Institute and attracts the largest number of Chinese students in Germany, most of whom study engineering and economic sciences. They support a growing network of relatively authentic Asian fast food joints which now compete with the kebab houses introduced by a previous generation of migrants.The reasons journey times from China are still far too long, as Staake sees it, lie mainly with the heavily unionised rail companies in Europe rather than their counterparts in Asia: trains take on average six days to travel the 1,300km (800 miles) from Brest on the Polish-Belarusian border to Duisburg, while the 10,000km from Chongqing to Belarus is often completed in five-and-a-half days. “The Chinese and the Kazakhs drive thousands of kilometres a day, they really work hard. It’s ridiculous, really. Of course we are trying to work out why this is happening. You know how many train drivers’ unions we have, and the Poles are not much better,” says Staake. At the Duisburg city museum, visitors can still listen to the chants and jeers of the workers who went on strike over the closure of the steelworks in the 1980s and early 90s. A button hidden inside a wall made of original Ruhr valley coal triggers a recording. The modern Duisburg port with all its modern marvel, however, has yet to find its place in the city’s memory. In the entrance hall to the museum, a wall greets visitors with the words for “welcome” in the languages of all the migrant workers who have shaped the city, from Kurdish to Greek to Polish. For now, the Mandarin or Cantonese phrases for “welcome” do not feature.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e16e3588b33218be628a87d205be7c07c9c3f2a/0_80_2301_1381/master/2301.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4f0c933fa1a4d010947f189025c7817","title":"emmanuel macron vladimir putin syria","story":"The French president has made a serious mistake in allowing Russia to distribute French aidOn 21 July a Russian military Antonov cargo plane landed on an airstrip in Châteauroux, central France. It was loaded with 50 tonnes of humanitarian aid – medical supplies, tents – and flew to Russia’s Khmeimim military base in Syria. This is a stronghold from which Vladimir Putin’s forces have launched relentless attacks on cities and neighbourhoods since 2015, as they threw their military might behind Bashar al-Assad’s brutal regime.In many ways, this was the moment Emmanuel Macron sold his soul to Putin in Syria. But this awkward mission wasn’t just about France’s image. The entire episode said something about a wider western malaise about how democracies can too readily sacrifice principles and how authoritarian regimes capitalise on that weakness.Macron and Putin had agreed to this joint operation during their meeting in May in St Petersburg. According to a Franco-Russian statement, the aid was destined for the people of eastern Ghouta – a suburb of Damascus that has been besieged by Syrian government troops and severely bombed by Russian aircraft. Eastern Ghouta is also where chemical weapons were used by Assad’s forces as recently as April, a crime Russian diplomacy has been busy denying in various international forums. The aid was officially meant to be distributed under UN auspices, but that turned out to be untrue: the UN itself later denied it had been involved. Only the Russian army and Syrian authorities controlled where the medical supplies went. In a nutshell: France allowed itself to be part of a Russia-Syria propaganda stunt that was aimed at showcasing cooperation with a European country whose diplomats had for seven years consistently denounced Assad and Putin’s policies in Syria. Why and how Macron agreed to aid this “humanitarian” gloss to Russia’s involvement in Syria remains unclear.Unsurprisingly, Kremlin-controlled media such as Sputnik and RT (the very outlets Macron lambasted publicly in 2017) were swift to talk up the news. But in France it received little or no attention. This summer the country is entirely focused on the Benalla scandal (involving a security guard Macron employed, who beat up demonstrators during May Day demonstrations in Paris). But the lack of scrutiny around Macron’s spectacular turnaround in Syria is striking all the same. And at this stage it’s not clear if unpleasant questions will ever be asked. Following a French tradition, Macron’s presidency organises no regular on-the-record briefings, so the Élysée gets to choose when it is publicly held to account.But the episode’s significance goes well beyond France’s borders. Macron’s duet with Putin in Syria could be a potential harbinger of more western capitulations over Syria, a human rights catastrophe in which an estimated half a million people have been killed and millions made refugees. Through this ill-advised action, France became the first western democracy to allow itself to be used in an exercise of high-level Russian spin – hardly a small gain for Putin.Perhaps you are wondering what is wrong with providing aid through the Russian army? The answer is in the question: even as a one-off operation, it is morally debasing. Not least because there was no guarantee the aid would reach the right people, or that it would not partly benefit forces that have massacred local populations.The gesture of transferring aid to the Russian military condoned its presence on the ground – along with the Syrian organisations working with it – as a credible conduit for relief. This from a country, France, whose representative in the UN in January was rightly asking what credibility could possibly be given to Syrian government statements or to those who support them.“Syria fatigue” set in long ago in western societies. It draws on a sense of powerlessness in the face of seemingly unstoppable horror and intractable complexity. Confusion and complacency have also been deepened by the spread of far-right ideas (bear in mind that Italy’s Matteo Salvini, France’s Marine le Pen, Austria’s Freedom party, and others, all approve of Putin’s actions in Syria) as well as the what-aboutery of the far left.It doesn’t help, of course, that the US president consorts with autocratic foreign leaders who exploit his narcissism and shallowness, nor that his one and only goal in Syria seems to be to protect Israel from the Iranian regional threat – entirely indifferent as he is to the suffering of Syrian civilians.But France had in recent years maintained a firm position on Syria’s bloodbath and Russia’s role in it. Now that the Élysée has in effect whitewashed the Russian military, it has taken the risk of abrogating whatever humanitarian principles upheld its choices – and that makes it look morally bankrupt. To what purpose? One explanation, suggested by sources in Paris, is that Macron wants to “stay in the diplomatic game” on Syria. With Donald Trump proving such an unreliable ally on Syria as on other issues, Macron seems to have concluded that he needs to get closer to Putin.Putin has certainly played his cards well in Syria,catching the west off-guard, and taking the upper hand militarily alongside Iran, Assad’s other key ally. Now that the last remnants of the 2011 anti-Assad popular uprising are being methodically crushed, he is intent on recruiting western support for so-called reconciliation plans, as well as western contributions to Syria’s “reconstruction”, all of which would take place under Russia’s control. It’s one thing for Europeans to be realistic about a dire imbalance of forces and to try to build a strategy aimed at preventing the worse-case scenario of yet more repression and radicalisation in Syria, still a potential breeding ground for terrorism. But it is very different to pretend Russia can be an ally in humanitarian matters, after its key role in the mass atrocities that have occurred, and after multiple vetos and other diplomatic obstructions at the UN.Macron’s presidency is racked by the fallout from the Benalla case. But this is another scandal, that ought to be closely looked into, regarding how a key European democracy responds to crimes against humanity and those who have helped perpetrate them on a mass scale. Putin is seeking western complicity in his cover-up of atrocities in Syria. He is seeking to rewrite recent history by drawing western countries into a narrative that casts Russia as a potential force for good rather than as the murderous accomplice of Assad.Recently Putin even went as far as mentioning Europe’s refugee problem as a further reason for the west to cooperate with him and with Assad, who has every intention of staying in power. This at a time when the Syrian regime has admitted to having tortured thousands to death in its prisons since 2011.The question now for European countries is whether they will willingly follow in Macron’s footsteps and become pawns in Putin and Assad’s game to secure validation as a first step towards securing western funds for reconstruction.Macron is a young French president who wants to lead Europe, and who has often displayed his taste for philosophy. As he courts Putin in the hope that it will help prevent France getting sidelined in Syria, he might want to consider what one philosopher, Reinhold Niebuhr, had to say about “the irony of history”. The irony, wrote Niebuhr, comes when “our dreams of pure virtue are dissolved” as a result of “taking morally hazardous action” and “courting prospective guilt”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e35c331f8f9f2bb9681075f2fe3a031eea5888af/0_98_3047_1828/master/3047.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e67d22f27635524f79648924d679dc0a","title":"heatwave climate denial summer 2018 sceptics","story":"The blazing summer of 2018 has led to a shift in tone from some rightwing sceptics who can no longer deny the obviousIt’s not always easy to recognise a historical tipping point when you see one, but I believe I spotted one when I walked into my local newsagent last Wednesday and saw the front page of the Sun. Over a map of the world which was coloured bright scarlet, the splash headline screamed: “THE WORLD’S ON FIRE”.Britain’s biggest-selling daily newspaper was not mincing its words. The subheading on the left-hand side proclaimed “PLANET GRIPPED BY KILLER HEATWAVE”, while the right-hand one announced: “HUNDREDS DIE IN EUROPE AND JAPAN”. And if you were wondering what the cause of all this might be, the accompanying news report carried a quote – just the one – from Len Shaffrey, professor of climate science at Reading University, who said: “Global temperatures are increasing due to climate change. The global rise in temperatures means the probability that an extreme heatwave will occur is also increasing.”I nearly choked on my KitKat when I read that. Is this really the Sun? The shoutiest outlet belonging to Rupert\u0026nbspMurdoch, the media mogul who famously characterised climate change as “alarmist nonsense”? Is something happening here?I think something is, and I think what the appearance of this front page in a rightwing tabloid signals is that the summer of 2018, which is throwing up extraordinary\u0026nbspclimactic extremes all over the northern hemisphere, from north Africa to the Arctic, is finally puncturing the bubble of so-called climate scepticism, at least in Britain. Let us at once say that it will take a lot more to puncture that bubble in the United States, where unabashed and brazen denial of the overwhelming scientific evidence for global warming is an article of faith not just with Donald Trump, but with the Republican party as a whole.But still it’s a start. Because what we are witnessing now is a historic shift in the way that the threat of climate change is perceived by the world, from prediction to observation. Remember: from the first report by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in May 1990, the whole argument that global warming is a potentially disastrous danger has been based on the predictions of supercomputer models of the climate system they were essentially the same computer models that forecast the weather up to six days in advance, but were now being tasked with forecasting the climate up to 100 years into the future. So most of the biggest climate change headlines for the last three decades have been based on prophecy, as it were, from successive IPCC reports calculating that unless we cut our greenhouse gas emissions, global average temperatures will rise by four or even six degrees celsius by 2100, and that sea levels will rise by up to a metre by the same date, and so forth. There have been five IPCC reports, and with each one the computer models have been more refined and the predictions more reliable, so the conclusions are likely to be more robust. Yet the uncertainty of predicting the future remains.These predictions have been the scientific strength of the argument for acting to combat the warming to come, but also, its political weakness. The large degree\u0026nbspof uncertainty they inevitably contain has provided the soil in which climate denial has sprouted and flourished,\u0026nbspafter the issue so lamentably became politically polarised between left and right. It has allowed climate action to be characterised by its rightwing opponents merely as an unnecessary and colossally expensive bet about the future, without overwhelming numbers of ordinary people – voters – disagreeing. This is because for the 30 years that ordinary people have been\u0026nbsphearing these predictions, they have not seen anything much to worry them when they look out of their windows.But observation is different. Seeing things happening around you cannot be gainsaid like predictions can, and in this remarkable summer of 2018, events in the real world have been starting to catch up with the climate models’ forecasts of an overheating globe. Not only has Britain sweltered in the five-week heatwave that finally ended last Friday, record-breaking heat has subjected Norway, Sweden and Finland to unheard-of temperatures – above 32C, that’s 90F, recorded 60 miles north of the Arctic Circle. Meanwhile in Ouargla, a Saharan desert city in Algeria, a temperature of 51.3C (124.2F) recorded on 5 July is thought to be the highest ever reliably measured in Africa. And so in Japan, and so in Greece, and so in Canada: all over the northern hemisphere, record-breaking heat.The reaction to all this from the Daily Mail last week was very much the traditional and expected take from the rightwing newspaper. It strenuously avoided the term “climate change” as long as it could on the same day as the Sun, it used the second sentence quoted above from Prof Shaffrey, but not the first one. The next day it could no longer avoid it, by reporting that the Commons environmental audit committee had forecast a trebling of heat-related deaths by 2050. But to set the balance right it wheeled out the reliable climate sceptic Christopher Booker to proclaim, in a truly feeble piece of polemic, that linking climate change to the heatwave was, as the headline put it, “Just Hot Air”.The Sun also carried an opinion piece from Rod Liddle, which looked at first sight like a climate-sceptic rant, but wasn’t – it was a scolding of the Met Office for nanny-state advice to stay indoors. Last Friday the Sun splashed again on the story with the front-page headline “BAKE TO THE FUTURE” and once more, climate change featured prominently in the news story. It quoted the climate scientist Peter Stott blaming\u0026nbsp“human-induced climate change” for the increasing global risk of extreme heatwaves. As a sub-headline summarised: “Scorchers could go on for decades say boffins”. I am fascinated by the Sun’s reaction to these events, so different from the Daily Mail’s, because I think it marks the moment when someone on a rightwing populist newspaper – someone clearly possessed of sharp news antennae – recognises that the time has\u0026nbspcome when people are finally realising beyond doubt that something abnormal is happening to the global climate. Who knows? Maybe Murdoch will order a different tone to be set in the Sun next week. But I still think it marks a tipping point, when observation begins to replace prediction in the headlines, and the start of a process that will eventually throw the perverted ideology of climate denial into the dustbin of history – where it belongs.• Michael McCarthy is the author of The Moth Snowstorm: Nature and Joy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fe782423e60270aa02a23e7b516d78c57f2cc69/4_278_5068_3041/master/5068.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66804d31e6daf0ac8a8c7c201a6a6c99","title":"people brexit brits government new political party","story":"I’ve always subscribed to Michelle Obama’s golden rule that when your opponent goes low, you go high. I don’t think one moment that we should sink to the levels of the Brexiters – the dodgy money, the electoral lawbreaking and the\u0026nbsplying – but I do wonder if those of us who remain deeply concerned about the consequences of Brexit are really landing all the\u0026nbspblows that we can.We need to, because the best interests of our country are at stake. If our generation fails to put up a proper fight, the generation that follows us will neither forgive nor forget, as theirs will be a diminished and, quite probably, dismantled United Kingdom. Leaving the EU is only the first phase of the Brexiter agenda to shake us free of the laws, rules and rights that many see as a constraint on the implementation of their\u0026nbspfrighteningly\u0026nbsprightwing vision of Darwinian\u0026nbspcapitalism.What is the right strategy for those of us who oppose this? I remain unconvinced that it lies in a new political party. The EU referendum in 2016 amounted to a fight between a group of well-meaning career politicians and their professional advisers, and a collection of obsessive haters of the EU prepared to do whatever it took to win. It took us a while to get our act together in the remain corner, and too often we allowed ourselves the indulgence of arguing among ourselves, becoming preoccupied with what Vince Cable memorably described as the “narcissism of small differences”.This will only become worse if the rumours that some of the remain campaign groups are contemplating metamorphosing into political parties turn out to be true. I’m bored of the jostling for position by big egos, the confused messaging, and the outdated talk of both remainers and leavers. Although there are some very brave politicians in Westminster – some who have risked their personal safety to stand up to claims they are traitors, simply for arguing for what they think is in Britain’s best interests – the political classes have, by and large, let us down. Two ruthless party machines have done a very good job of stopping anyone from either side of our so-called debating chamber from asking awkward questions, or standing in the way of impending chaos.So I don’t see a new political party helping. Neither do we need a general election, where the Tories and the Labour party can only offer a choice of Brexit, Brexit and still more Brexit. I am not, I might add, about to enter the political fray myself as the leader of the Liberal Democrats, as was absurdly rumoured in\u0026nbspthe media last week (ignoring the fact that I am not even an MP).A clean vote on the real options is the only right and democratic way forward. Three options should be put to the public: the deal Theresa May negotiates, the special deal we already have with the EU (so cannily negotiated by Margaret Thatcher), or no deal. And given that Brexit supporter Jacob Rees-Mogg has conceded it could take 50 years to see any economic benefits, 16- and 17-year-olds should be allowed to vote, as Brexit’s negative consequences will be felt for most of their adult lives.The facts are now colliding with the soundbites and the personalities, and it is making for a bonfire of vanities. Both of our main parties face the real possibility of fracture if the people are not given the chance to have their say. We have had enough of decisions that are fundamental to our future – so many of them never even mentioned during the referendum campaign – being made without any reference to what the public thinks.The British are a people who are generally happy, under normal circumstances, to trust politicians to tell us the truth and to leave them to run the country as we get on with our lives. But we reserve the right, always, to make it clear that they are our servants, not our masters, and, when necessary, we can and will take charge. We now wish to exercise that right with a referendum on the options facing Britain once the prime minister has\u0026nbspnegotiated her deal.• Gina Miller was the lead claimant in the successful legal fight to allow parliament to vote on whether the UK could start the process of leaving the EU"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c04f6106689ba97e105c76359f0396de745a0337/0_352_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72caff081f7ded30f21132b401aaba46","title":"cruel britannia banter humiliation selfie","story":"If vulnerable people are being targeted for the sake of a selfie, it’s a symptom of a deeper sicknessIt hasn’t been a good 24 hours for British banter merchants. Two incidents reported yesterday demonstrated that if you thought acts committed in the almighty name of bantz couldn’t get any worse, you were wrong. Having hit rock bottom, banter has found a trapdoor in the floor, opened it up and ed in.In Benidorm a group of British tourists on a stag party allegedly paid a homeless man €100 to have the name of the stag tattooed on his face. Pictures of Tomek, a 34-year-old Pole, were put up on social media and then taken down following an outcry. The man whose name appears in the pictures to have been tattooed on Tomek’s forehead says the story has been misreported.In the Suffolk town of Bury St Edmunds, a group of teenage boys allegedly spat at a 49-year-old disabled woman, pelted her with eggs and covered her in flour. Their assault complete, they posed for a series of triumphant selfies. It makes you wonder what might be next for banter.Will the nation’s top bantersaurs live-stream homeless people fighting to the death on their own YouTube channels? Will they throw children that can’t swim into the deep end and take bets on how long they take to drown? Will they rip off the clothes of elderly couples in the supermarket and then pose with them for a series of legendary selfies?The truth is that we are already living in that world. Last January two teenage friends killed a homeless man with a machete because they thought it was “funny”. The murderers were later seen recreating scenes from the attack, laughing as they burned their own clothes.Last year Snapchat footage showed a Cambridge law student in white tie goading a homeless man by trying to burn a £20 note in front of him. Members of Oxford’s exclusive Bullingdon Club – past members include David Cameron, George Osborne and Boris Johnson – are said to burn a £50 note in front of a homeless person as part of their initiation.What makes these stories so depressing is the power imbalance. At a time when homelessness and poverty are on the rise and wealth inequality is soaring, banter is here to make the situation bleaker still. Being the victim of banter merchants – who essentially feel that vulnerable people are not fully human and therefore fair game – is part of this equation.It is also a micro example of a macro problem: vulnerable people are treated with contempt by our government, business and public institutions, so why should it be a surprise that they are then treated in the same way by iniduals? The boredom experienced by the banter merchants combines with the insatiable need for social media content in a toxic mix. The removal of inhibitions provided by drink and drugs only adds to this.On that night out in Benidorm, the stag party are said to have found someone they could use to create what they hoped would be a legendary bit of banter, something that would rack up the likes and the views on social media. His feelings were not considered because as a homeless person, he had no power to assert them. This is what we talk about when we talk about toxic masculinity – a macho, narcissistic performance that regards the vulnerable as weak and humiliates them for it.The sadness is not only with the victims, though. There is an emptiness driving these sadistic stories that can’t simply be explained away with a line about bad apples unhinged by drink and drugs. Social media offers everyone the chance to have their 15 minutes of fame, but in doing so encourages people to up the ante – perhaps it’s only by getting a homeless guy to tattoo your mate’s name on his forehead that you are going to get the attention you crave.It speaks, also, to the relative lack of opportunity available to the banter merchants. They have the prospect of puncturing lives of boredom and struggle with moments of performed cruelty. Conducted among a group of relative equals, banter – or something like it – can be a bonding experience, it can give people the feeling of community they long for and doesn’t have to humiliate the vulnerable. The problem is that in our society, the vulnerable are forever targets for humiliation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51dd5135a7598f34cb03a51ff700815922364a5f/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf52d2673f905072d93524f0a8349edf","title":"nightlife is a vital space to shed inhibitions why doesnt britain value it more","story":"East London has gained a bad reputation for its ungodly rents and an over-saturation of people who call themselves trend forecasters. But for decades it has also been the subcultural engine of the UK. It is the birthplace of the Aba Shanti-I sound system, grime and hipsterism. The photographer Gavin Watson described it as rave’s spiritual home and I once saw Rihanna go into a pub on Columbia Road wearing fishnet cycling shorts.Last week, Hackney council did its best to bring that era to a close. In a unanimous decision, it decided to ban all new venues from opening past 11pm on weekdays and midnight on weekends. It is a curfew more familiar to Year 10s who have to call home first if they are going to stay over at someone’s house than to Britain’s supposed nightlife hub.What is particularly galling about the Hackney decision is the way the council is still trying to pretend it is down with the kids. Writing in the  on Friday, Hackney’s mayor Philip Glanville defended the decision, claiming that while he was bang up for a good time, and nightlife “is at the heart of the borough’s creativity”, he also had to think about vomit in the streets, extra policing and a major clearup operation – so if we could all kindly be tucked up in bed before the shipping forecast, that would be tickety-boo.That is the problem with recent half-hearted attempts to save Britain’s nightlife. They are all focused on the abstract concept of cultural value. Clubs are deemed worthy only if they have some artistic output, not in and of themselves – so the Barbican can put on more late nights and cabaret bars are saved while actual clubs continue to close.Certainly, exciting new substrands of dance music can emerge at 5am when someone plays a record at the wrong speed, and certain spaces can become safe havens for marginalised communities. But those can’t be planned for, they are corollaries of a nightclub’s central purpose: to be a space of abandon and freedom where you can be inebriated and uninhibited. Clubs are the engine of the following week’s gossip, over quieter dinners and swift halves. They are the difference between a “fine” and an “oof” when someone asks you how your weekend was on Monday morning.Of course, nobody wants a situation where nightlife is making the lives of other residents a misery, but Glanville’s binary between streets flooded with vomit or an entire borough taking itself to bed at 11pm is bizarre. The problem is bad licensing and poor provision: as more clubs close, the ones that remain become tense and overcrowded. Chain cocktail bars on the same strip of one street all chuck out at the same time, leading to inevitable screaming matches over mistaken Ubers and gin-in-a-tin-fuelled loitering as clubbers realise they have nowhere else to go. If you are lucky, things might continue in someone’s living room – which is probably why there are nearly eight times more noise complaints about residential properties than there are about nightclubs.I have just spent a few months in New York, where nightlife is accessible and relaxed – clubs have DJs playing outside in sweltering back gardens and restaurants open up into dancefloors. It means people – even, gasp, people in their 30s and 40s – have a natural disposition to stay out late, to be with each other, to throw caution to the wind. New York has many problems, but few of them seemed to be caused by bars being open later.Hackney’s decision mirrors similarly draconian rules across the country, from the Glasgow licensing board’s forced closure of the Arches to Westminster council revoking the licence of Soho’s Madame JoJo’s to Mac’s Bar in Preston eventually closing after six years of disputes with the council and the police. If we can’t give some special dispensation to nightlife in one of the most creative boroughs in the capital, where 52 out of the 57 seats are filled by Labour councillors, many of whom will have enjoyed considerable support from young people, what hope is there for venues in Tory districts on the south coast?I have long been a fan of Demi Lovato, a surprising and relentlessly honest singer who has suffered from addiction and severe eating disorders on and off since graduating from her early acting career on the Disney Channel. Last week, she suffered a dangerous overdose, shortly after she released Sober, a song that contains striking lyrical similarities to Amy Winehouse’s Rehab, albeit with a more helpless tone.Of course, some people’s demons will catch up with them whether they are a popstar or working on a supermarket checkout. But it is hard to ignore how often child stars end up having a serious breakdown in their mid-20s. After Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, Mary-Kate Olsen, Amanda Bynes, Justin Bieber and Mischa Barton have battled with some combination of addiction, mental health issues and eating disorders, you wonder why anyone would let their child sign away their life to tween stardom.The past year has reminded us how cruel Hollywood can be to women, but does there need to be a reckoning over how it treats children, too? An increasing number of former Disney stars have said they sustained psyschological trauma at the network. Selena Gomez, a close friend of Lovato’s, has said: “It’s really dysfunctional to be in this industry at a young age where you’re figuring out who you are. I don’t recommend it.” Cole Sprouse, another Disney graduate, has said he developed “horrifying” anxiety from being “raised on a sound stage” and sought to dissuade others from following in his footsteps.Must the house of Mickey Mouse take some of the blame for what happens to its stars after they leave the channel? If the gloves fit.I have just got back from New York, where you can order 39 different flavours of cream cheese and the streets are paved with high-fructose corn syrup. I was quite looking forward to escaping yet another glum July – yet I have apparently missed the Summer of Our Lives™. I expected a thunderstorm of schadenfreude but one never materialised. Instead, I was flooded with Instagrams of seemingly endless summer nights, grim parts of the Thames becoming emergency swimming spots and, for a while at least, a bizarre national sense of unity at the suggestion that football was coming home.

They will go on display to the public along with more than 50 notebooks containing notes on two of the Pythons’ films, Holy Grail and Life Of Brian. Material deemed controversial at the time was reportedly discarded and would still be seen as too risque today.Palin, 75, has given permission for the sketches to be reproduced and admitted the group often produced more material than was needed.“Sometimes you have things like that.

Sabry Mosbah from Tunisia, Wazimbo from Mozambique and members of Niger’s Tal National were prevented from entering the UK, Smith said. Indian sisters Hashmat Sultana, who also experienced difficulties entering the country, arrived 24 hours after their scheduled performance.Gabriel, who co-founded Womad in 1980, said: “The right to travel for work, for education and even for pleasure is increasingly being restricted and often along racial and religious lines.Smith said it was the latest example of the government’s “hostile environment” policy affecting international acts scheduled to perform in the UK. He said this year marked the first time artists declined invitations to perform at Womad, with many citing the difficulty of entering the country under the automated visa system that first created issues for the festival in 2017.“Whether their perceptions are real or inflamed, the reality is that artists are deciding that the hassle and cost of entering the UK are neither worth the return nor the exposure to rejection that the process might bring,” Smith said. “For now this is a trickle, but how do we prevent it becoming a flood?”Womad asked Home Office and Foreign Office contacts to intervene in inidual cases, which led to some visa cancellations being overturned. “Sometimes this works but not consistently,” said Smith. “At Womad it is our intention to embark on urgent discussions with our contacts at the Home Office and our partners in the cultural sector to find a way to welcome international artists and ask them to continue their contribution to making the UK a tolerant and forward-thinking focal point of the global cultural community.”Gabriel said: “There have been, and continue to be, good people within the Foreign Office who try to help us every year, but the warnings are becoming clearer: if we want a country which is open to people with ideas, traditions, food and culture different from our own, we have to change the current visa processes and find ways to turn back the growing anti-foreigner tide.“Musicians travel for a living, and almost everywhere I have travelled I have been met with kindness and generosity. Do we really want a white-breaded Brexited flatland? A country that is losing the will to welcome the world?”Freedom of movement for musicians has come under scrutiny since the EU referendum vote. Last week the House of Lords published a report recommending a “touring visa” which would improve access to the EU for British performers post-Brexit and vice versa.Smith questioned whether the hostile environment policy reflected the will of the nation. “I strongly believe it is not how British people feel, and the 35,000 people who attended the Womad festival last weekend agree. “Britain is a country built on a foundation of erse cultures it is a country that respects and is excited by ersity and a country that wants to take its place on the global stage.” “Tragically, this is not the message that is being projected beyond our borders and the potential damage to our communities, culture and economy as a consequence of that is, frankly, heartbreaking.”"},{"url":null,"title":"jimmy kimmel rudy giuliani rabies late night","story":"Comics discussed sexual harassment claims against Les Moonves and Kimberly Guilfoyle, and Giuliani’s evolving defense of TrumpLate-night hosts on Monday discussed the sexual harassment allegations against CBS chairman Les Moonves, Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, and Rudy Giuliani’s evolving defense of Donald Trump.“I heard there was an article about CBS chairman and man-I hope-isn’t-watching-tonight’s-monologue, Les Moonves,” began Stephen Colbert, who joked that the reporter behind the story, Ronan Farrow, told him all he needed to know.“Ronan isn’t exactly known for his puff pieces about glamping,” said the host. “The CBS board met today and announced they’re in the process of hiring outside investigators. I don’t know why they’re outsourcing this: they could just use the cast of the new CBS procedural: CSI: CEO.”Colbert went on: “There’s also, by the way, allegations against somebody I don’t work for, because last week we learned that Kimebrly Guilfoyle allegedly left Fox News amid accusations of sexual misconduct.”According to sources, Colbert explained, Guilfoyle has been accused of showing personal photographs of male genitalia to colleagues and identifying whose genitals they were. “Which is horrible workplace behavior,” said the host, “and also the least popular edition of the board game Guess Who?”“This story becomes way more interesting when you know Guilfoyle is currently dating presidential son and man-reacting-to-his-girlfriend’s-photo-collage Donald Trump Jr,” said Colbert. “Which means, and brace yourself for this, there’s a good chance Guilfoyle was forcing people to look at Don’s junior.”Comedy Central’s Trevor Noah discussed reports that Robert Mueller is looking at president Trump’s tweets in his ongoing obstruction of justice investigation.“Late last week, it was reported that the Mueller investigation has entered a new phase,” began Noah. “Even though Mueller hasn’t been able to interview the president yet, last week he figured out how to do the next best thing.”After showing news coverage about Mueller’s investigation into Trump’s tweets, Noah said: “I know some people are saying this is ridiculous, but remember: the president told us many times that @realdonaldtrump is the real Donald Trump.”The host then cut to videos of Trump saying Twitter is his way of “bypassing dishonest media” and getting his message out. Noah joked: “When Mueller does finally get Trump into court, forget the Bible, they should make him swear on his phone.” The host then briefly plugged The Daily Show’s own book, the Donald J Trump Presidential Twitter Library, an organized compilation of Trump’s tweets.“Investigating Trump’s tweets for obstruction of justice is a good idea, but you don’t have to go on Twitter to do it,” said Noah. “Because we at The Daily Show have already combed through Trump’s tweets and we’ve come up with our own definitive analysis.” “And it turns out,” Noah concluded, “Crooked Hillary and the FBI are the real Russians.”Meanwhile, ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel discussed Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani’s appearances on cable news, where he tore into Michael Cohen and argued collusion is not a crime.He began: “The president lashed out at his former lawyer Michael Cohen, who made the potentially devastating claim last week that Trump had advance knowledge about the infamous meeting between his son and the Russians at Trump Tower.”Kimmel then read aloud Trump’s tweet in which he slammed Cohen for retaining former Clinton attorney Lanny Davis as his lawyer. “That is interesting,” said Kimmel, noting that Trump’s own defense team includes Emmet Flood, a former Clinton impeachment lawyer. “Who in this situation would hire one of Bill and crooked Hillary’s lawyers? Oh, wait a minute, you did!”“Cohen must have something good because the president’s attack dog Rudy Giuliani was all over TV this weekend calling him a liar,” said the host, showing a clip of Giuliani claiming Cohen has “lied all his life” and is “an inherent, pathological liar.” Two months earlier in a television interview, Giuliani called Cohen an “honest, honorable lawyer.”“I think Rudy Giuliani might have rabies,” Kimmel quipped.“On top of all this, this morning on Fox, Rudy added a new twist, questioning whether collusion is even a crime,” Kimmel noted, before showing a clip fo Giuliani and Fox \u0026amp Friends host Steve Doocy agreeing that collusion is not illegal.“Say what you like about Rudy,” said Kimmel, “but when it comes to collusion he has been nothing if not consistent.”The host went on to dig up past videos of Giuliani saying allegations of collusion are “fake news” and not supported by “a stitch of evidence.”Kimmel concluded: “He’s gone from no one in the Trump campaign had any contact with Russians, to a few people might have met with some Russians but they talked about adoption, to, okay, they were talking about helping Trump win the election but they weren’t colluding to, even if they were colluding, not a crime.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/740bce887f702768d746e6cec7ed754a38717a40/0_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d71daab108e45c99f487cbfea3a17761","title":"chinas most populous area could be uninhabitable by end of century","story":"The most populous region of the biggest polluter on Earth – China’s northern plain – will become uninhabitable in places if climate change is not curbedThe deadliest place on the planet for extreme future heatwaves will be the north China plain, one of the most densely populated regions in the world and the most important food-producing area in the huge nation.New scientific research shows that humid heatwaves that kill even healthy people within hours will strike the area repeatedly towards the end of the century thanks to climate change, unless there are heavy cuts in carbon emissions. “This spot is going to be the hottest spot for deadly heatwaves in the future,” said Prof Elfatih Eltahir, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, US, who led the new study. The projections for China’s northern plain are particularly worrying because many of the region’s 400 million people are farmers and have little alternative to working outside.“China is currently the largest contributor to the emissions of greenhouse gases, with potentially serious implications to its own population,” he said. “Continuation of current global emissions may limit the habitability of the most populous region of the most populous country on Earth.”The new analysis assesses the impact of climate change on the deadly combination of heat and humidity, which is measured as the “wet bulb” temperature (WBT). Once the WBT reaches 35C, the air is so hot and humid that the human body cannot cool itself by sweating and even fit people sitting in the shade die within six hours. A WBT above 31C is classed by the US National Weather Service as “extreme danger”, with its warning stating: “If you don’t take precautions immediately, you may become seriously ill or even die.”The research, published in the journal Nature Communications, found fatal WBTs of 35C would strike the north China plain repeatedly between 2070 and 2100, unless carbon emissions are cut. Shanghai, for example, would exceed the fatal threshold about five times and the “extreme danger” WBTs would occur hundreds of times. Even if significant carbon cuts are made, the “extreme danger” WBT would be exceeded many times.The scientists also analysed south Asia in 2017 and found it too is at risk of killer 35C WBT heatwaves in places. Even outside the extreme hotspots, three-quarters of the 1.7bn population – particularly those farming in the Ganges and Indus valleys – would be exposed to “extreme danger” levels of humid heat towards the end of the century.Prof Chris Huntingford, at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology and not involved in the study, said: “The research finds that if greenhouse emissions continue at current levels, there will be many more days when unsafe thresholds are crossed. This will make work outdoors almost impossible across much of the agricultural regions of China.”“Work like this is especially useful, as it allows governments to plan better future agricultural practices, including what is needed to support farmers to operate safely and thus ensure food security,” he said.The most extreme temperatures in all the analyses were found in the Gulf, but those occurred over the sea. In the case of the north China plain, Eltahir said: “This is where people live.”Climate change is the key driver, but the massive irrigation used on crops on the north China plain was found to be significant too, adding about 0.5C to the high WBTs. This is because the evaporation of irrigation water leads to higher humidity and because water vapour is itself a powerful greenhouse gas.The scientists did the analysis by running detailed computer climate models for the past 30 years on the north China plain. Those models that closely replicated the actual measurements were then used to project the climate of the region from 2070-2100 for different levels of carbon emissions.Even with cuts in greenhouse gases, Eltahir said public health measures would be needed in China, such as air-conditioned shelters and education of the population about the dangers of extreme heat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1dcbcd922a4a2999acc803d01f5d1a8991a658ec/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4395a4d8a61b8982ceb9f836d1054a5","title":"amphibious dressing swimwear outerwear","story":"Fashion delights in new ways to wear old things. This is how the trainer ended up on the front row, how the Ikea Frakta bag went from the car boot to the catwalk and how slip dresses slipped into Céline’s spring 2016 collection.But rarely does it encourage you to extend the wear of things you already own. Still, these are desperate times. We can’t and shouldn’t keep buying new clothes simply because of the weather. And if last weekend’s rain brought with it a mix of flooding and respite from the heat, it also bought us time to gear up for the second wave. Because a new reign of hot terror is coming! And this time we need to be prepared – so get ready to wear your swimsuit as daywear.Unpacking this trend, which you may be doing if you are on holiday, is simpler than it sounds. For one, a swimsuit is designed to be both wet and dry, which is good for the hot human body since most don’t show up sweat. And while this is not a trend for the office, the headline is misleadingly daft: fashion writers talk about day-to-night dressing (how to dress for a temperature drop without bringing a whole extra outfit to work) a lot. Amphibious dressing is simply beach-to-street dressing.The roll call of evidence is already pretty convincing. Topshop suggests you wear its textured swimsuits “beyond the beach”. Cossie + Co, a new brand that sells proper one-piece swimsuits in grown-up colours, are also “not reserved for the beach”. Zara, meanwhile, has styled a white swimsuit with a pencil skirt fit for the boardroom.A recent image of Julie Pelipas, fashion director of Vogue Ukraine, wearing a “swimsuit-like top” and loose trousers was declared “the most perfect outfit of the summer” by the fashion blog Man Repeller. In a recent article, the New York Times suggested pairing the bestselling swimsuit from a new collaboration between Staud and Solid \u0026amp Striped with Levi’s jeans. And then there’s Alexa Chung, who posted a swimsuit-and-denim skirt selfie last Friday on Instagram Stories with the caption: “Swimwear as workwear was the only option.” When something becomes normalised by Chung, it is usually here to stay.Perhaps we could have seen it coming after Marni “superimposed” a swimsuit shape on to a dress in its current collection. And we have certainly seen a version of this before, with underwear worn as outerwear, a trend explored by Rihanna and Beyoncé that has become so pervasive it now has its own Wikipedia page. Wearing your swimsuit as a top is probably an extension of this.Huddart says she has seen the firm’s swimsuits “take on a erse new role – worn as much off the beach as on”. Natascha Wittgenstein, founder of new Swedish brand Tooshie, concurs (although she prefers the word “multitaskers” when talking about wearing hers out at night). Still, they agree this is an era of textured swimsuits. As Huddart says: “A swimsuit no longer means just that.”These are weird times for swimsuits. While Love Island messed with their very essence (contestants’ swimsuits this year had enough cut-outs to trigger trypophobia), the one-piece recently came under scrutiny after the Miss America pageant announced it will eliminate one of the most contentious aspects of the competition: the swimsuit round.If underwear continues to be a battleground about primal sexuality, then it’s time for swimwear to take on a new role."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a38359e67cc8afcba6267eea16efe00cb5a2b2d1/0_74_3807_2286/master/3807.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ed533413b516fc0864b926b7d40257a","title":"manchester united wrap up us tour with win over real madrid","story":"It will take much more than a pre-season win to cure José Mourinho’s ever darkening mood. Beating a Real Madrid side who have just begun their own preparations for the new campaign means little in the grand scheme of things yet for Mourinho, who made few friends and even more enemies in Spain during a typically tempestuous three-year spell, it perhaps carried a touch more significance than most of these tune-up encounters.Excellent first half goals from Alexis Sànchez and Ander Herrera placed United firmly in control of a game they deserved to win against, it must be said, undercooked opponents who barely got out of first gear until the second half. Karim Benzema’s 45th-minute strike gave the predominantly Madrid supporting crowd of 64,14 here something to get excited about, yet it was not enough.The Old Trafford manager would have been pleased to see Sànchez looking near to his busy, creative best while there was an assured first start for Brazilian midfielder Fred. Herrera and Juan Mata also impressed. It has, nevertheless, been an extremely long two weeks in the US for Mourinho – this was their first victory in regulation play (AC Milan were defeated on penalties in Los Angeles last week) – who has reverted to miserable type with aplomb.“I didn’t learn anything (from this tour),” Mourinho said. “I know what Herrera, Mata and Sànchez are, I know the kids are very young and need time to grow up. The boys gave everything and we tried to fight for the best result, but tactically it means nothing.”The Portuguese will be delighted to get back to Manchester although whether the problems which have blighted a tempestuous pre-season will be solved before the start of the Premier League season remains to be seen. The absence of Anthony Martial continues to prompt questions, and when asked again whether the Frenchman would return to join the team in Manchester, Mourinho said, “I don’t know.”The manager’s travails, which came to the fore last weekend in Michigan with an astonishing broadside against some of his own players while privately fuming with executive vice chairman Ed Woodward’s lack of transfer activity, would certainly have raised a smile in the Real Madrid ranks. The 55 year-old never felt truly loved during a rollercoaster spell at the Bernabéu from 2010 to 2013 which saw everything unravel in true Mourinho style – falling out with almost everyone before heading for the nearest exit door with a knowing grimace.His situation at Old Trafford is yet to reach that kind of meltdown level though new signings – a central defender and a winger are his priority – are needed to diffuse unhappiness and breed confidence ahead of what promises to be a testing campaign trying to keep free-flowing Manchester City at bay. This was United’s fifth game of this trip but for Real, a visit to Hard Rock Stadium was the first of a three-match International Champions Cup schedule which sees further encounters with Juventus and Roma.With David de Gea making his first appearance since returning from a post-World Cup break and new signing Fred, the Brazilian midfielder who cost £52m this summer from Shakhtar Donetsk, enjoying his first start, at least Mourinho was able to see some of the 12 key first team players who have missed most of this trip return to action. There was, of course, no Cristiano Ronaldo on show for Real following his move to Juventus, so it was left to Gareth Bale and Benzema to produce the kind of star quality an expectant crowd at the home of the Miami Dolphins came to see. The Madrid pair teamed up early on, the Welshman starting a move which saw the French striker shoot past the post from close range.Fred acquitted himself well as United began to get a foothold in the game and on 18 minutes, Sànchez swept them ahead. It was a passage of play which could have even made Mourinho smile – Herrera sent Matteo Darmian free on the right and the Italian’s cross was steered in by the Chilean forward. It was a superb move yet the one which followed nine minutes later, was arguably better. Darmian lifted the ball to Mata and once the Spaniard had regained his composure he crossed for Sànchez who was able to ert the ball into the path of Herrera. His finish was precise and clinical. Bale curled wide soon after yet Madrid’s attacks were so sporadic, it was a surprise to see them pull one back just moments before the end of the first half, Benzema steering in an excellent Theo Hernández cross.Bale, a one time target for Mourinho, was withdrawn for the second half as Julen Lopetegui shuffled his pack and one of the substitutes introduced, Martin Ødegaard, should have levelled on 56 minutes when he blazed over the bar from eight yards. The young Norwegian also saw a free-kick saved by De Gea on 73 minutes but Mourinho’s side held firm. Now, however, the hard work really begins."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e451fa130ffa6d346b8a2c1ac0b22b839b9693b5/738_271_940_564/master/940.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a678b740cb0f55e30cd3a2fd979e2de","title":"efl managers red yellow cards","story":"Managers will receive red and yellow cards this season in a bid to clean up touchline behaviour. Although Premier League managers will only receive verbal cautions for “irresponsible behaviour” in the coming campaign, in the FA Cup, Football League, Carabao Cup, EFL Trophy and National League, they will be shown cards.The EFL has said that the change of rules, piloting an International Football Association Board (Ifab) scheme will help “protect the reputation” of its competitions. Meanwhile, the Premier League will adopt the same rules of “accumulated stage 1 warnings” – any activity by the manager or his staff in the technical area considered irresponsible by the match official – but verbally and without the use of cards.Managers will receive yellow cards for incidents such as kicking a water bottle, sarcastic clapping or any other gesture that could be considered as attempting to undermine the match official. A red card would be handed out for actions such as violent conduct, spitting and stopping the opponent restarting play. The manager would also be culpable for punishment should any member of his or her staff in the technical area or dugout be deemed to have behaved irresponsibly. Only the match official – not assistants or the fourth official – will have the power to issue cards to a manager, although there is a hope that, over time, that could change.The EFL’s chief executive, Shaun Harvey, said: “If the behaviour of any one of the members on the bench, usually led by the manager, gets to the level where it’s not appropriate, as like a caution on the pitch, the referee will issue a yellow card to the bench.“If the behaviour continues in a manner that he doesn’t feel appropriate – effectively like a totting up of a number of fouls – then there’s the opportunity for a second yellow card to be issued at which stage the manager leaves the bench area. If there’s a serious incident deemed by the match official, the manager will be shown a red card and go to the stands. It will hopefully improve behaviour in the technical areas. This is not about creating a drama. It is about making sure behaviour doesn’t decline further.”If a manager accumulates four yellow cards, they would receive an automatic one-match ban, eight a two-match ban, 12 a three-match ban and 16 or more would result in a visit to Wembley to sit in front of a Football Association disciplinary panel. Subsequent fines or stadium bans for repeat offenders – if deemed appropriate – also will be determined by the FA. There will also be an end-of-season amnesty to avoid managers missing matches of great magnitude.Harvey added: “We don’t want managers missing play-off games and play-off finals because he has had four warnings.”Harvey hopes the rules will have an impact far beyond the Football League, including at grassroots level. “Professional football forms opinions and is what people look up to what professional footballers do and indeed managers do is often deemed as being the acceptable norm,” he said. “We do hope this changes the behaviour away from the professional game as well. But, we have to start somewhere, this is the pilot and hopefully it will be something that is followed by everybody else in the future.”Ifab has said the experiment was designed to make it possible “for disciplinary action to be taken against persistent offenders”. The measures, which will also be implemented in the Checkatrade Trophy and National League competitions, will be introduced from Friday, when Reading play Derby County in the Championship season opener."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37b0e28632bf637a8e6edee0a62888fd4e17f92a/0_247_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e027497e9b54de0415d97a38005f447","title":"manchester united v real madrid international champions cup live","story":"The first three minutes of the Barcelona-Roma game had more action than the entire second half of this one.

Unfortunately, he wasn’t fouled. Shot! A shot on goal! From the top right of the box as De Gea sees it, and he sees it all the way to his hands.90+3 min: Real play the corner short and pass a few more times before a pass is deflected high in the air for De Gea to collect. 90+2 min: United have nine field players back ... oops, wait, the 10th comes sprinting back. They concede a corner.90 min: Nearly the same situation, and this time, they shoot. Shot hits a red wall. Only three minutes of stoppage time.Then out of nowhere, Nacho unleashes the best shot of the half, just going over the bar and nestling in the top netting from 25 yards out.89 min: Real Madrid set up a promising opportunity to shoot. They pass. Sigh.88 min: Stats thus far -- Manchester United have six shots, three of them on target. I honestly can’t remember the third.Real Madrid have 13 shots, two on goal. One was a goal, the other was a free kick from a tough angle that would’ve hit De Gea’s head had he not punched it clear.But Madrid have surely completed hundreds more passes.87 min: Paul Moody asks, “if utd win what will media angle be on ongoing mourinho crisis.”83 min: A final change for United (because you can only make substitutions at three distinct times in this competition), and we’ll see James Garner, known to American audiences as the star of The Rockford Files. 81 min: A rare United foray forward ends with a e. Meh.At the other end, Isco chips it for RDT, who tries to pull it back across the box.Then CHANCE -- and two Real players collide while trying to get to the ball in the 6-yard box.79 min: McTominay takes a boot to the head. He’s not hurt, but Demetri Mitchell steps onto the field in his place anyway. So, yes, United remembered to use a substitution.RDT fails to connect in the box. A follow-up Real corner is defleted wide.78 min: Real make their final four substitutions, with Toni Kroos among the newcomers.74 min: Shaw trips Valverde just outside the box to De Gea’s left. The free kick is whipped directly at the goal from the tough angle, and De Gea punches clear.71 min: Manchester United complete 1-2 passes a few yards into Real Madrid’s half of the field. Then back to business as usual.69 min: A touch at last for Real Madrid’s second-half keeper ... oh no ... what was his name? Ah yes, Andriy Lunin, a teenager signed from Ukraine’s Zorya Luhansk. He receives a 50-yard back pass with no trouble.67 min: It’s Spain vs. Russia redux. Pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, now pass it forward ... oops, no one’s there. Manchester United finally make a substitution. Fred claps his massively linked arms as Tuanzebe steps onto the field in his place.65 min: So Real have made 6-7 substitutions. Manchester United have made none. Could we get a shot of the bench area, please?

Also on: Oscar Rodriguez. To me, the photo of Fred (20 mins.) explains why the new United signing came with such an... inflated... price tag. Speaking of Slurpees. As you probably know, Free Slurpee Day at 7-Eleven stores here in the U.S. is on 711, July 11th. I’ve always wondered if in the UK (and elsewhere) it falls on 7.11, 7 November. Also, I hate Sergio Ramos.Is anyone awake in the UK to answer the question? About Slurpees, not about Sergio Ramos. 57 min: CHANCE -- The crowd has started to recognize the good things that happen when Vinicius has the ball. In this case, it’s a shot that Odegaard blasts over the bar from close range.55 min: A brilliant catch by ... a supporter in a plain white T-shirt maybe 20 rows behind the goal. Javi Sanchez will not make the case for inclusion in Real’s senior team with that effort.54 min: A long ball finds Mayoral in the United box, but he is quickly swarmed by players in red.53 min: Still Real possession, still no real shots. 50 min: Real Madrid with several minutes of possession. Fred gets the ball and is dispossessed, leading to a powerful shot just wide, but the referee tells us Fred was fouled in the process.48 min: Real Madrid squander a free kick so quickly the cameras didn’t even catch it. They were busy showing us the foul -- Pereira on Odegaard. De Gea comes out to play the ball with his left foot, sending it out of play, which was probably the best possible outcome.46 min: Out for Real Madrid -- Bale, Benzema, Casilla (the keeper) and Theo Hernández.No, the second half hasn’t actually started yet. I should’ve gone out for a Slurpee at halftime.Time to play “spot the second-half subs”! Ready, everyone?Halftime stats give Real Madrid a 66-34 possession edge. Weren’t those roughly the same numbers we saw when Spain played Russia?So every time I say the game has hit a lull, the opposite happens. Let’s see if I can use these powers for good ...All three of these will now be untrue, right?Just a superb buildup -- a backheel, a cross inside the 6-yard box and Benzema sticks out a foot to redirect it past De Gea.45+1 min: Shaw brings down Odriozola for some reason, but the United defense copes with a rather half-hearted attack. Maybe Real are content to let Isco, Kroos and company lead the comeback after halftime.45 min: And whenever I say we have a lull, Manchester United unlock the Real defense. A good give-and-go, and Real are forced to head the ball out for a corner.We’ll have four minutes of stoppage time thanks to the water break and whatever was ailing Bailly.44 min: This continues to be a game of spurts and lulls, and we’re currently in the latter.42 min: Might not be a cramp after all, as a replay shows the ball that was deflected out for a corner may have deflected off the part of the body players guard when they’re in the wall for a free kick. The corner is finally taken to no effect.41 min: And we have our second cramp of the night. Appears to be Bailly.40 min: And we have our first cramp of the night. Appears to be Bailly.39 min: Real Madrid enjoying possession between the midfield stripe and the top of the box. Then Bale finds Llorente in the box, and the end result is a corner.36 min: Nothing of interest. Fred hasn’t played badly, but he has been mostly invisible while the quick strikes have been provided by Alexis, Herrera et al.34 min: The game has resumed. In fairness, it is rather humid in Miami. That’s because it’s ... Miami. Stuart Graves writes: “The “e” on Bale’s shirt is an English pound sign – lol.” Wouldn’t it be a Euro? Looks like fans are working out the parking issues ... The reaction shots after the Herrera goal were priceless. Tons of United supporters looking on in disbelief. Too stunned to smile.31 min: CHANCE-ish. Or maybe Bale is just impatient, whipping in a shot from outside the box and over the bar.And we get a water break, though it’s hotter in much of Europe right now than it is here in the USA.30 min: Bale wins a corner against a succession of sliding United defenders.

The ASA said in its ruling: “Whilst we acknowledged that a proportion of services were delayed due to exceptional or unforeseeable circumstances outside of Gatwick Express’s control, such as track faults, fatalities and power supply failures, we considered that a significant proportion of services were delayed for reasons that were within Gatwick Express’s control. As such, we concluded that the claims ‘non-stop to Victoria station in half an hour’ and ‘in just 30 minutes’ had not been substantiated and were misleading.”Separately, the ASA also banned a Eurostar ad campaign promoting £29 fares for trains to France. A complainant said they had been unable to find a ticket for London to Paris at that price. The watchdog investigated and found that only a very small percentage of the promotional tickets were made available, and travellers would have to book as far as 18 weeks in advance to have the best chance of getting them.In 2015, the ASA ruled that the Heathrow Express had to drop its claim that the train ran “every 15 minutes” after a customer complained that the frequency dropped to once every 30 minutes late in the day.A Gatwick Express spokesman said: “Just a third of Gatwick Express delay minutes were within our control, however we acknowledge the ASA ruling and began withdrawing these adverts many months ago.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/965532aeec9022df58a13754c7b20bc35a6c5ece/0_398_5915_3549/master/5915.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e265447697449dfe34f0ceb9dc6df2f","title":"viagogo ticket prices fees delivery costs","story":"I cannot afford to lose this money. I am a student and need it to pay my rent. I recently used Viagogo to buy two tickets for George Benson at the Royal Albert Hall. I guess I am a victim of its hard sell as the site reminds customers tickets are selling fast. Their face value was £75 but only after completing did I realise they had cost £430. I have been told by staff at the Royal Albert Hall that the majority of its high-value tickets were sold directly to an inidual on Amazon who used Viagogo to resell at a huge premium. I purchased tickets for the rugby autumn international Ireland v New Zealand from Viagogo. I believed I was paying €390 for five tickets and was constantly under pressure on the site with countdown clocks. It was only when I confirmed the purchase that I realised the cost was €2,400 for the tickets that haven’t even been released yet. Viagogo’s apparent brazenness has been breathtaking and, so far, it’s managed to profit with impunity.In April the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) threatened it with legal action for failing to comply with its demands that it make its pricing more transparent.A month later, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) reported it to National Trading Standards for similar defiance.The company has been cocking a snook at regulators since 2015 when the CMA ordered it to display the face value of tickets it was reselling. It didn’t. In 2017 the ASA told it to make its exorbitant fees and delivery charges clear at the start of the transaction. It didn’t.Until recently, the final cost price of a ticket, including Viagogo’s fees, did not appear until the completion stages when customers were about to pay – resulting in some overlooking the total. This month, however, over a month after ASA’s deadline for compliance, it has started specifying add-on fees beneath the advertised ticket price, albeit in faded grey eclipsed by the lurid countdown clocks.However, it has still failed to respond to the CMA’s demands that it identify sellers, make clear the face value of tickets and warn customers that some venues do not accept tickets from secondary ticket websites.The CMA is also concerned about the countdown clocks that hasten customers into a transaction before they’ve digested the small print.The Royal Albert Hall says that the show’s promoter allocated tickets in PR’s row to Amazon, as it was a legitimate agency for the show. “It appears a member of the public purchased them and then resold on Viagogo,” it says. “We do everything in our power to prevent tickets from being bought for resale, and are very clear fans should avoid firms like Viagogo.” Amazon ceased operating as a ticket agency in March.Viagogo has not responded to requests for a comment.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

The pair will hope to show they are in a different class by earning more money than Bez and Rowetta Idah, who will be representing their Manchester-based musical rivals.It is unclear whether Cocker will drive a hard deal with antiques dealers and pretend he’s got no money – or whether the singer will be looking for opportunities to make profits from the piles of mis-shapes, mistakes and misfits available for purchase.However, advance publicity photos appear to suggest Cocker declined to wear the distinctive coloured polo shirts handed out to contestants and instead elected to remain wearing a suit jacket.Pulp have not performed for a paying audience since a Sheffield homecoming show in 2012 concluded a brief series of reunion concerts. Cocker has since concentrated on other interests including his art, his BBC 6 Music radio show, providing voiceovers for Sainsbury’s supermarket adverts, performing at the KLF’s reunion gig, and working on a new solo project.The special episode of Bargain Hunt will air on BBC One to mark the corporation’s annual Music Day on 28 September, which will involve hundreds of special events being held across the UK.Other events to mark the day include Kylie Minogue recording announcements that will be played on the UK transport network, while choirs will sing at 40 railway stations to entertain commuters. The BBC Singers will perform for passengers travelling on the Euston to Birmingham railway, and Manchester link will have performances from “local music legends”.There will also be a special edition of the game show Pointless featuring BBC radio presenters joining with musicians Lianne La Havas, Ella Eyre, Lesley Garrett, and Amy Macdonald.The choir leader Gareth Malone will host a special All Star Music Quiz programme, and Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour will be drawing up a list of the 40 most important women in the global music industry in the Women in Music Power List."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa001b582bbed9b9cab3e0d8eb5f5a7a52de2a56/0_0_5168_3101/master/5168.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c431b8b05c72093046b16ce4795a8d54","title":"nevis how the worlds most secretive offshore haven refuses to clean up podcast","story":"The years since 2008 have seen a global crackdown on offshore finance.

It will also depend on the post-Brexit customs arrangements reached with the European Union. Therefore, the ‘temporary’ traffic-management system Operation Brock will be in force for some time.”The document expresses concern at the slow pace of work on Operation Brock, and states “there does not appear to be a plan B”.The report says: “The freight vehicles currently only take seconds to clear the port of Dover but if Brexit ends up creating regulatory and tariff barriers between the UK and the EU, it is predicted that there could be gridlock around the town and through to Maidstone and beyond.“If increased waiting times persisted then perishable goods could be damaged and supply chains interrupted. There is also a potential impact on air quality of any increased traffic queues at border controls.“Customs checks on imports from outside the common market can take between five minutes to 45 minutes per vehicle. Port officials have warned that increasing the average time it takes to clear customs by as little as two minutes could lead to 17-mile traffic jams.”The council, which acts as the health authority responsible for food safety checks at Dover and the Channel tunnel, also raised concerns about its powers.The document asks whether the government fully understands that the port health authority “has powers to examine and detain food, but not to physically stop vehicles in the first place”.It adds that officials are “in the large ... blind as to what is entering the port”.The layout of the port is open with no physical boundaries, which means there is nothing to stop vehicles leaving, and the health authority has “inadequate facilities at the port to inspect food or appropriately store food”.The document states: “We ask that the government fully engages with us to ensure that the food safety function is fully understood and any proposed controls are outlined ... to ensure that they are relevant, workable and logistically feasible bearing in mind the current status.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/392bc39edec87d0eeed0184a4ae11236634d592f/95_221_3330_1998/master/3330.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b992e08b771bd467522054a03848cff6","title":"england trust adil rashid india test series","story":"The five Test series against India condensed into little more than six weeks will determine whether this is an annus horribilis or mirabilis for England. The drawn Test series against Pakistan was a disappointment although it was countered by ODI victories against Australia and India. But this is what will define England’s summer.Both captains have their issues though it was hard to establish that as they trod a stately path through their obligatory press conferences on the eve of the match. Virat Kohli leads the No 1 ranked team in the world but he is forever asked about his (very modest) record in England and the disparity between his side’s home and away record, which is substantial.The focus on Kohli’s previous output here and his struggles against Jimmy Anderson must be manna from heaven for all his other batsmen. On Tuesday he was serene, soft-spoken and mellow, when answering questions exclusively from Indian journalists. He spoke in generalities and his words were received as if he were a very senior politician or a minor deity.The problem for Joe Root is that England have won only one of their past nine Test matches, the last one they played at Leeds. He naturally tends to regard that victory as the platform of a revival. This series will test the validity of that theory. We were assured that both sides were “in a good place”.In reality the selection processes of both sides may indicate their state of mind just as clearly. England announced their side 22 hours before the start of the match which suggests a forthright, uncompromising attitude, though this is not necessarily confirmed by the names selected. At Edgbaston there was the opportunity to allow Root a wide variety of options, four pacemen and two spinners even before the captain considered himself (Root, remember, managed to polish off Lancashire’s lower order in the Roses match with remarkable speed last week – Adil Rashid could not have done it any quicker).The surface at Edgbaston had changed hue by Tuesday. The pitch itself now has very little green grass visible it looks brown, dry and reasonably hard unlike the outfield, which is verdant green, a source of angst, one surmises, to water boards and reverse swingers. With a weather forecast that predicts more sunshine and high temperatures, there is a good chance that spinners will have an impact on the game.When explaining his chosen side Root said: “This team gives us great balance. It gives us a huge number of options. I feel it gives us the best chance of taking 20 wickets. That’s the thinking. It gives us great variety, different angles, different spin options and some world-class performers with the ball.”Well, that sounds reassuring. The bold approach would have the pacemen doing most of the damage in the first innings with the spinners having an impact in the second. But to have the maximum number of options with the ball in this side Dawid Malan would have been replaced by Moeen Ali.But Moeen, who has a fine Test record at the ground where he started his professional career, has been omitted and Rashid is the solitary specialist spinner (with due deference to Root). This means that there are just two changes from the side that beat Pakistan in Leeds.Maybe they were uncomfortable about making more changes than that after such an overwhelming victory. If confidence really was high there was surely a strong case for playing Moeen. It is not obvious how much this weakens England’s batting lineup.Admittedly Moeen has not scored many runs this summer – neither has Malan – but in his last Test against India he did score 190 runs in the match at Chennai in December 2016. One never quite knows what Moeen is going to do, which remains one of his charms. Without Malan, Moeen would have been a candidate to bat at four so would Ben Stokes, who seems to have swayed towards becoming an old-fashioned blocker since his return. Or England could have drawn straws to establish the order from four to seven, which may not go down so well in the scientific 21st century.The absence of Moeen makes Rashid’s role trickier. He has never played a Test in England he has never been the solitary specialist spinner in the side. And he has never started in a Test match with the words “He’s a spoilt brat” from Geoffrey Boycott ringing in his ears.Moeen has been Rashid’s mentor in recent times and it might have been helpful to have him in the side to help carry the spinning burden. Now Root has to bowl Rashid in the first innings, whether he likes it or not that situation would have been eased with Moeen’s presence. This selection makes life more difficult for the returning leg-spinner.Kohli was far less forthcoming about his side. In the recent past India have tended to play just one spinner in England and they could do the same on Wednesday with Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Shami and Ishant Sharma supported by the all-rounder Hardik Pandya.The unusually talented Kuldeep Yadav, the left-arm wrist-spinner, was included in the squad but it would be a surprise if he played. England have seven left-handers in their team, most of whom were neutered by the off-spinner Nathan Lyon in Australia, so Ravi Ashwin will surely play. Ravindra Jadeja skittled Afghanistan in his last Test and he knows how to bat. Two spinners, Ashwin and Jadeja, would seem to be a good idea for the tourists."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0496f07539918a3cdf4fdf1f8e9ad69fec85d03/0_58_5184_3113/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0514f1acaa61f1b85762a5f89201e4d","title":"kareem open letter nfl owners","story":"To deny professional athletes the right to express dissent in a peaceful manner is a disgrace to the Constitution, the opposite of patriotism and shameful moral weaknessWhew! What a tumultuous year for your league. Slipping attendance and ratings. Continuing concussion controversy. Lawsuits from cheerleaders who refuse to shut up and smile. Domestic violence accusations against players. The Papa John’s founder mouthing off about something or other. Players taking a national anthem knee (NAK, for short). President Trump’s “problematic” rambling. Commissioner Roger Goodell under siege from, well, everybody. Bet it makes you fellas long for the good old days when all you had to worry about was Janet Jackson’s nip slip. Where’s faithful Hodor when you need someone to hold the door against relentless attackers?Then you made it worse.In May, you implemented a childish policy about how grown men must respond to the national anthem: a player can stay in the locker room during the anthem, but if he takes the field and then protests, the team and the player can be fined. Oh, Dear Owners. You stood at the precipice of history tasked with deciding whether to choose the principles of the US Constitution over profits of commerce, patriotism over pandering, morality over mob mentality, promoting social justice over pushing beers. Sadly, you blinked. Courage, it seems, is expected only of players.Now, following the Miami Dolphins channeling of the abusive students in Stanford Prison Experiment by over-punishing protesting players, the May agreement is frozen and new negotiations have begun, this time including the NFL Players Association. A kneejerk reaction came on 26 July when Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones announced he would require all players to stand during the anthem – or else. President Trump was not too busy with his tariff wars to claim a personal victory: “Way to go Jerry. This is what the league should do!” (Too busy to put in that comma after “go,” though.)Why aren’t you NFL owners outraged by that? If it were white people suffering those same statistics, you wouldn’t even play the national anthem. Then again, you wouldn’t have had the opportunity to become owners in the first place.To be fair, not all you owners have cowered under the false flag of patriotism to hide their shame. New York Jets chairman and CEO Christopher Johnson said the team would not discipline a player who protests and he would pay the league’s fine. Giants co-owner Steve Tisch has also said that his players will not be punished for protesting during the anthem. Jeffrey Lurie, owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, released a statement vaguely supporting his players right to “influence positive change”, Jed York, the CEO of the 49ers and the sole abstainee from the May vote, has not elaborated on the club’s policy. I’m sure your players appreciate your loyalty to them. The rest of us respect your integrity in the face of political pressure. And there is the $90m the NFL has earmarked for social justice causes over the next seven years.We all are entitled to our opinions, but when those opinions translate into actions that affect the whole community at large, we have a responsibility to scrutinize those opinions, to hold them to a higher standard of reason. Denying your players their freedom to express their concerns sends a clear message that you don’t value your black players’ values. You’re telling them that they must abide by your white perception of social justice even though you have no experience with the kind of institutional injustice that robs their community of lives, hope and a future. You are owners in that you own the franchise, but you don’t own the players or their hearts and minds. I’m reminded of the song from protest singer Phil Ochs, “I’m Gonna Say It Now”:Ooh, you’d like to be my father you’d like to be my dad,And give me kisses when I’m good and k me when I’m bad.But since I’ve left my parents I’ve forgotten how to bow,So when I’ve got something to say, sir, I’m gonna say it now.If not now, when?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57b3dfcb32956f2a2a6b8a2f3223f9867b4258de/226_328_4799_2879/master/4799.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b9f1ce975de5513f1697d42cbc09a55","title":"lizzy yarnold i wanted to scream winter olympic double gold medallist","story":"Britain’s most successful Winter Olympian spent four months on medication due to an ongoing back condition but she is hopeful a spinal operation will enable her to finally enjoy her successLizzy Yarnold avoids lingering in her sitting room because of the bad memories it stirs. She lives in a cottage 10 miles inland from Portsmouth, thoughtfully decorated, including intricate Lego models of Tower Bridge and The Simpsons’ house, constructed with husband James, and a small vegetable patch in the back garden. It is an idyllic setting but in the four months since winning a second Olympic skeleton gold it has been the scene of an agonising daily battle.“I try not to go in that room too much because there is a grey sofa in there which I spent weeks just lying on and crying,” she says. “In the morning I’d take an industrial amount of painkillers and lay there waiting for them to take effect.”It is only now that Yarnold, 29, feels comfortable enough to talk in detail about the chronic back pain which meant she underwent spinal surgery in June and has still not been able to properly celebrate becoming Great Britain’s most successful Winter Olympian. “I know this is a conversation I need to have,” she says, “to try and show the truth behind the smiles and everything you might see on social media. There’s the price of having been successful.“At the moment I can see this gold medal but I can’t pick up the letters that drop through the letterbox. I’m hoping over time when I recognise the impact of the gold medal, through going to schools and talking to kids, that it will feel like it was worth it.”Yarnold had been hoping to avoid surgery and is glassy eyed when recounting the moment she realised there was no realistic alternative. “The doctor said: ‘You can’t stay on this amount of medication.’ As an athlete that’s hard to hear but I had to face up to that. They cut a hole in my spine and chipped out bits. On the notes it says “harvesting loose fragments from Lizzy’s spine”.Yarnold started her career as a track and field athlete, specialising in heptathlon. Even before switching to skeleton a decade ago, she had a bad back. But she is also aware that hurtling down an icy track at 80mph an estimated 1,500 times, in training and competition, will not have helped. “Yes, my back is going to be worse in 10 or 20 years because I’ve been an athlete but I wouldn’t have ever chosen a life without sport so it wasn’t a sliding doors thing. In 2012 I had a back seizure in a gym in Calgary and couldn’t move for hours.“The muscles on either side of the spinal column seize up and it’s intense pain. At the world championships in Königsee in Germany in 2017 we were packing up afterwards and I was crawling on the floor in the bathroom to get the shower gel, crawling over to my bag to put it in, and I didn’t really think anything of it because I’ve always had a bad back.”At the Sochi Olympics in 2014, Yarnold won gold to justify her position as favourite having dominated the season, but four years later in South Korea it was a different story. She had taken a year out after Russia and had mixed fortunes after returning.What her fellow competitors did not know is that six months before Pyeongchang, she had also discovered a growth in a knee. Yarnold was warned the tumour could be cancerous but only a biopsy would be able to determine the cause of the problem and the medical team said the risk was low. She opted to continue on to the Games without having surgery.Further obstacles were thrown up on arrival in Pyeongchang. First, there was the onset of a chest infection. “We were staying on the seventh floor of the hotel and had Belgium and New Zealand above us and only one lift. If I was coming out at the seventh floor I could see the other nations thinking: ‘Why can’t you just walk up the stairs?’ They weren’t heated so there was ice on the windows. I started walking up and down everyday and the pain in my chest worsened to the point I was unable to speak. The first day of competition I was in the warm-up bit on the bike coughing up sweet-corn-sized bits of phlegm and struggling to breathe. The doctor listened to my chest and said: ‘You’re really ill, you’ve got a really bad chest infection but there’s nothing I can do for you now.’”On the first day of competition she also suffered a flare-up of a vestibular disorder which makes her dizzy and disorientated. “After my first run I went to the bathroom, took off my suit and couldn’t see anything,” she says. “I said to Louise Turner, the physiotherapist: ‘If I go again is it going to kill me?’ It sounds dramatic but it felt extreme, like life and death. I don’t know if I’m going to lose orientation within the first few corners and then you’re just going to be a rag doll at 80mph. She assured me there would be doctors at the bottom of the track who knew what was going on.”Yarnold managed to maintain third position overnight and her condition improved the next day she created history by becoming the first Briton to successfully defend a Winter Olympic title. She overhauled Janine Flock of Austria on the fourth and final run, while her British team-mate and close friend Laura Deas claimed bronze.She had been looking forward to lengthy celebrations but just weeks later underwent a knee operation. Being on crutches seemed to worsen her back pain and she was diagnosed with two displaced discs.“I went to friends’ houses and I’d be able to sit and have dinner for five or 10 minutes and then I’d have to go to lie down in their lounge in my one no-pain position,” she says. “When I got the honour of the OBE, the British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association office sent me this amazing bunch of flowers and I had to go and collect them. I was so angry because I was thinking, ‘I don’t want flowers, I want to be able to go to the toilet without having pain.’ It made it really difficult that people were saying well done, without knowing what I was going through.“I wanted to scream: ‘I wish you knew the truth.’”Yarnold did not get into sport to be a role model but it is a responsibility she takes very seriously. She is also outspoken about the need for mental health to be of paramount importance in athletes. “I’m seeing someone for support. If everyone could see a therapist that would be an amazing thing. The hardest thing is admitting you are struggling.“I haven’t been able to drive so I’ve been getting the train to school appearances. Because I can’t sit up I would have to lie across two train seats with my feet dangling off the end. Someone even tweeted me saying: ‘I thought it was you and wanted to say hi but you really didn’t look like yourself.’ I felt very guilty that I wasn’t the athlete that they wanted me to be.”Because of the cocktail of powerful painkillers Yarnold has been taking for the past four months, her memory is fuzzy and she cannot yet contemplate returning to competition. What she really wants is to be healthy and enjoy the fact she had made history.At the side of Yarnold’s fridge are several unopened bottles of champagne. She bought a case from a vineyard in New Zealand and gave a bottle to each of her coaches. “Because I can’t drink alcohol on this medication it’s all just sat there,” she says. “It’s a simple thing but I’m a Guinness person and I could really do with a pint of Guinness right now.”Hopefully she will be able to properly toast her successes soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/460a4903ad9c3641fb347be7b50a3bcf5db576fe/0_19_4169_2501/master/4169.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=889b4e9d3baa6fdc9761c6135bcfd414","title":"sophie bray lily owsley england hockey world cup","story":"The phoney war is finally over and now England face a potentially tournament-defining night against the most dangerous of foes. They overcame the banana skin of South Korea in this crossover match for a last-eight place, winning via goals from Sophie Bray and Lily Owsley at either end of the match it means hot favourites the Netherlands, free-scoring so far, lie in wait for Danny Kerry’s side on Thursday.After a series of profligate group stage performances, England knew a fast start would aid their cause against opponents who had already conceded seven times to the Dutch. They came out flying and Alex Danson had already threatened when Bray struck in the ninth minute.It took her two attempts to beat Hwang Hyeon-a after superb work from Sarah Haycroft and the celebrations were put on hold as Korea sought recourse to the video umpire. Their appeal, for a possible foul by Haycroft, failed and England had the platform they wanted.That was the cue for England to assume near-total control and chances to increase their lead followed. Bray, Susannah Townsend and Danson – twice – all came close to a second, while there had been next to no threat from their opponents before half-time. By then, the shot count stood at 9-0 in England’s favour.They were almost punished midway through the third quarter when Cheon Seul-ki forced an alert save from Maddie Hinch. It was tighter, tenser fare now, the Koreans more assertive and England more frayed. Danson came close to a breakaway goal but as the minutes ticked down the home side were increasingly under the cosh.In a frantic finale Hinch saved brilliantly from An\u0026nbspHyo-ju and then, 60 seconds later, Owsley made the game safe. Her second goal of the tournament came with South Korea stranded upfield and she had the relatively simple task of rolling the ball into the open net from an angle.“I really enjoyed the first half,” Kerry told the BBC afterwards. “We absolutely smashed it. In the second half, we lost some shape up front, but the first half was fantastic.“I knew the second half would be cagey as fatigue set in, but I’m a pretty proud coach. We have a few things up our sleeve for the Dutch.”England’s quarter-final will start at 6pm on Thursday. Immediately after it Ireland, one of the World Cup’s early success stories, will battle India for the last of the semi-final slots. India defeated Italy 3-0 earlier on Tuesday, Lalremsiami scoring early on before Neha Goyal and Vandana Katariya added goals in the second period.Wednesday’s last-eight ties see Germany take on Spain in a rematch of their final Pool C fixture before Argentina, who have stuttered up to this point, face Australia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04298830155237a9ccce4564e8472fb19b6fe367/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=caf88a3d4d0cd5669b087902dabb94d7","title":"matt rees beth vyse adam hess standup edinburgh","story":"A former alcoholic, a cancer survivor and a man who lost all his money in a Bitcoin crash are among the comics coming back from the brink at the Edinburgh fringe‘I didn’t start drinking until I was 18,” says Matt Rees. “That’s quite a rarity for someone in the UK. But straight away, I recognised that I liked it – and I knew that one day I’d have to stop.”Rees, who was born in Maesteg, south Wales, is making his debut at this year’s Edinburgh fringe with Happy Hour, a look back at his battle with alcohol. He started performing in 2010 and quickly scooped up some new act awards. Then, two years ago, his comedy career stalled as he experienced problems with addiction.Being a standup, Rees “got away” with his drinking for longer than most. “It’s quite normal to go up on stage after a few pints, and it’s fine to be hungover the next day. Someone with a normal job would’ve been fired. But I was just getting on with it.” In 2016, after a visit to his GP, the damage became clear. “There’s an enzyme called GGT that shows how hard your liver’s working. It should be under 50 in a healthy adult. At that point, mine was over 1,700. My doctor said, ‘You’re going to kill yourself if you don’t stop drinking.’”Happy Hour makes Rees part of a new wave of comedy at the fringe, as standups share stories of coming back from the brink. Last year’s Comedy Award was shared: Hannah Gadsby won for her passionate diatribe against homophobia and sexual violence, and John Robins for his raw account of his reaction to a breakup. This year, to name just a few, Dave Maher describes surviving a coma, Louise Reay explores free speech after being sued by her ex-husband, Jim Tavaré relives his near-fatal car crash, and Lou Sanders tackles addiction.Which brings us back to Rees who, on Good Friday last year, stopped drinking completely. “I was physically dependent by that point,” he says. “The shops weren’t open and I wasn’t so much craving a drink as physically needing one. My only option was to go to hospital for Valium. I went to my first meeting on Easter Monday and it’s been abstinence from then on.”On Easter Sunday – two days after checking himself into hospital – Rees went on stage and talked about his addiction, and the material has now been bolstered into an hour-long show. Although standup, which mostly exists in pubs and clubs, is a boozy environment, the 28-year-old says the support of the comedy community has been a huge help with his recovery. “There are a lot of comedians who are ex-drinkers, so I had no shortage of people to ring when it was getting too much. You could argue that it’s a risky environment, but when I did my first gig two days after hospital, it helped – it gave me a boost. I like comedy clubs. If I’m giving up booze, I’m not giving up comedy as well.”Beth Vyse is another comic who has turned life-threatening experiences into comedy. As Funny As Cancer, her acclaimed absurdist show from 2015, tackled her battle with breast cancer via dreamlike bus rides with Michael Jackson and a pile of ping-pong balls. Her latest show, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, which finds her in character as desperate daytime TV host Olive Hands, deals with no such hardship. But it does come to the fringe a year later than planned.“Last year,” says Vyse, “when I was eight-and-a-half months pregnant, my partner started feeling dizzy. After finally going to hospital, they found a cavernoma in his brain. They’re basically abnormal cells and they’d haemorrhaged, so there was blood in his brain.”Luke Chaproniere, her partner, was told surgery wasn’t possible. The only option was to wait for the blood to be absorbed back into the brain. After three months, he had recovered – by which time Vyse had given birth to their son, Henry. They decided to take a show to Edinburgh but, with a month to go, Chaproniere’s symptoms returned and they were forced to cancel.“It would’ve been silly to do it,” says Vyse. “Especially with the new baby. I could’ve gone up on my own, but I wanted to be with Luke. I couldn’t have done this show with anyone else.” Indeed, Chaproniere isn’t just Vyse’s partner, he’s her comedy team-mate. He advises on scripts, directs her shows and operates all the technical aspects. The second wave of symptoms turned out to be a scare – not another bleed, but the old blood becoming dislodged. Within a couple of months, Chaproniere was feeling better. The show was back on for 2018.But a major aspect of it has changed. In The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, Vyse explores juggling her career and motherhood through madcap games and set pieces, but it features a starring role for young Henry. “Not to be rude,” she says, “but last year Henry would’ve just been a cute, breathing prop. He was only three months old. Now he’s a bit older, he reacts to things. I’ll use his responses as part of the show. Whether Olive Hands takes them on board or just ignores them, I’m not sure.”The comedian Adam Hess has no such dependents – and that became a factor in the experiences he has turned into his show Seahorse. “What happened to me,” he says, “made me realise, in both the saddest and happiest way, that I don’t have any heirs. I’ve got nothing.”Last year, the 29-year-old hit rock bottom, after losing all his savings when a tech investment crashed. Hess has always been fascinated with technology and, after reading about the rise of Bitcoin, invested £200 in the cryptocurrency. A few hours later, his portfolio was worth a whole 50p more. “I thought, ‘Oh my god, just a few hours and 50p return – great!” So he kept investing and soon most of his savings were tied up in the digital currency.For a while, all was good. The value steadily increased – but then it started to plummet. “I failed to realise that all of the articles I was reading were written either by someone with an incentive to make me buy more, or by people as deluded as me. I mainly wanted to pay off my university debt so I could say, ‘Now I can be a proper grown-up.’”Instead, Hess found himself revisiting his childhood: having lost his shirt, he was forced to move back in with his parents – and that was the inspiration for Seahorse. “The fact that I’m 29 and the parent-child dynamic still exists is so funny,” he says. “Like, I’m given less dinner than my dad – and fair enough, he’s in charge of me. But I’m bigger than him.”Cohabiting with his folks isn’t the main focus of Hess’s show, though. After moving back home, he went through old photos and childhood possessions that brought back memories of his school days. “The show’s about sexuality and kind of about me thinking I was gay. I preferred wearing dresses, I fancied a couple of boys, and I loved everything that was ‘fabulous’. And then I was told it was wrong, so I just had to repress it. At the time, I thought it was being gay, but maybe I was just woke as fuck!”Hess insists he has “nothing new to bring to the table” in terms of opinions: the show is simply his personal stories. But being at home has made him feel more comfortable talking about his experiences. “I feel safer there,” he says. “I’m constantly surrounded by people I love. It’s been a silver lining that funny stuff has come out of me losing a bit of money.”But, as any comedian will tell you, taking a show to Edinburgh is expensive. Most comics don’t break even over the month-long festival. So after his financial disaster, how is Hess justifying spending cash on this year’s fringe? “It’s so funny,” he says. “In order to do this show about losing money, I’m having to lose more money. But no matter what, I will probably go to Edinburgh every year till I’m dead.”• Matt Rees and Adam Hess are at Pleasance Courtyard.

Those accounts sometimes used Russian IP addresses and paid for advertising in roubles. The people behind the accounts removed on Tuesday, which had a total of 290,000 followers, used virtual private networks (VPNs) to conceal their locations and internet phone services to hide their identities. They paid third parties to spend approximately $11,000 (in US and Canadian dollars) for about 150 ads on Facebook and Instagram.“At this point we don’t have enough technical evidence to state definitively who is behind this, but they have shown similar activity and have connected with known IRA accounts,” said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy.In one case, a known IRA account was a co-admin on one of the pages for seven minutes before the account was removed from Facebook. “We think that is interesting but not determinative,” said Alex Stamos, the company’s chief security officer. Stamos said it was not clear whether this was the “IRA with improved capabilities or a separate group”.Stamos said intelligence agencies were in a better position to make an attribution by combining the technical details from Facebook with their own knowledge of the political motivations and goals of countries and other threat actors.“If they want to make an attribution decision, it’s up to them,” he said.In spite of Facebook’s caution over attribution, members of Congress who had been briefed by the company this week were quick to ascribe blame to Russia.“Today’s disclosure is further evidence that the Kremlin continues to exploit platforms like Facebook to sow ision and spread disinformation, and I am glad that Facebook is taking some steps to pinpoint and address this activity,” said Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat.Some of the deleted pages include “Aztlan Warriors”, “Resisters” and “Black Elevation”. The “Resisters” page created a Facebook event for a protest on 10-12 August titled “No Unite The Right 2”. Admins for the page connected with the admins of five legitimate pages to promote the event and post logistical information for protesters. About 600 users said they would attend the event and 2,600 expressed an interest in attending.“We disabled the event earlier today and reached out out to the legitimate admins of five other pages,” said Gleicher. Facebook also pledged to inform the people considering attending the protest about what happened. There was also coordinated activity around #AbolishICE, a leftwing campaign aimed at shutting down the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, the New York Times reported. The activity appears to echo the Kremlin’s creation and promotion of black activism pages such as “Blacktivist” in the run-up to the presidential election.Facebook revealed that the bad actors had created 30 Facebook events since May 2017, most of which had been scheduled over the past year. The company said it did not know if people had showed up to those events.Facebook said it would continue to investigate the activity and share any further findings with law enforcement and Congress. “Security isn’t a problem you ever completely solve,” said the company’s chief executive officer, Mark Zuckerberg, in a Facebook post. “We face sophisticated and well-funded adversaries, including nation states, that are always evolving and trying new attacks.”The cybersecurity researcher Lukasz Olejnik said: “Artificially inducing civil unrests or protests via internet platforms is a worrying development, and incorporation of Instagram is quite novel.”He added: “This development touching Washington indicates that concerns about European parliament 2019 elections might now be viewed in rather intriguing light.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12007a9d55bdcabfeff37f687e3bfc6eeb16d4bd/563_536_3287_1973/master/3287.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e83ac4671aeef136d00dfaf9dae145c","title":"the community space bringing scandinavian chic to glasgow","story":"For Fika Sake has become the centre of a thriving community in the heart of Scotland’s largest city, as part cafe, part learning space and lifestyle hubThe idea for an events space centred around coffee and cake was inspired by a place where so many good things originate – Scandinavia. Fika is the most recent Swedish tradition spreading across the globe. “It’s about taking time out of your day to actually sit down and maybe relax with someone or maybe yourself – usually over coffee and cake,” says Simon Forsythe, Glasgow-based owner of For Fika Sake.Forsythe’s space is part cafe, part community hangout and part creative workplace. Covering 185 sq m (2,000 sq ft) in the centre of Glasgow, For Fika Sake is drawing in everyone from students and freelancers to yogis and parenting groups who want to engage with other locals and like-minded people while learning something new.Forsythe brought the idea to life in January 2016, opening the doors after a year of planning. “It started when I was having fika at a cafe in town with a friend,” he says. “I was working a part-time job in a normal cafe and was fed up with that experience. She was running music workshops in Glasgow and wanted to work on a different project.” After bringing in one other partner, they came up with the name: For Fika Sake. “We thought up a funny, controversial title, a play on words and we stuck with that and went with it,” says Forsythe.The sense of community created by the cafe extends beyond its doors – the coffee, tea, and cake that give the space its name are sourced from local suppliers. On any day of the week you can walk into For Fika Sake to find people filling the space with music from an old piano donated by a local social enterprise, in pottery workshops run by local artists up on the mezzanine, discussing their latest reads during a book club, or catching up with friends.“It’s great to have this kind of community coming in and using the space for what it was originally designed for,” says Forsythe. “One in particular that stands out is the community for young parents. The big space means they can come in and store their prams in the corner and hang out with other parents and their babies.”After a challenging start, seeing the space come to life has been the big payoff for Forsythe. In December 2016, he had to take on the business himself after his two partners left to pursue other projects. “It was a bit of a shock,” he says. “But the business seems to have taken off since last January.” While he admits it was tough, particularly with the other stresses that come with starting a new small business – like big overheads – he says one of the perks to come out of it is being able to make decisions quickly and easily. “There was no compromise-with-partners involved, so I was able to get things done and out of the way,” he says.Now word of mouth has spread and the business is growing, and that quick decision-making is allowing Forsythe to try new ideas and systems to keep things running smoothly. He recently switched over to a new platform to help him get on top of his cashflow. He chose Square because he liked the “cool and simple” card machine – but also because he could access his funds the next working day.“It’s made a massive difference,” he says. “With this kind of business the most important thing for survival is cashflow, so being able to access your funds the next working day is a serious win. If it’s over the weekend you get your cash on Monday rather than Wednesday.”It’s also given him the time and freedom to focus on drumming up creative ideas for new workshops and events to help the cafe thrive. But if creating a community hub was the grand idea behind the space, it’s the cafe and fostering the tradition around fika that Forsythe reckons is the powerhouse of the enterprise. “It keeps the business going and it creates that space for people to use the workshop side of things,” he says.Using Square’s app, he can create a product button for a new kind of service on the spot – a convenience he appreciates, given the ever-changing use of the space and the introduction of new workshops and events. “Overall, it’s running nice and smoothly and going with that original plan, which is amazing to see.”Where does he see himself next? Hopefully with a second space, in a few years, although perhaps somewhere sunnier. “I’d love to see it grow and take on another premises in another part of Glasgow or potentially in another city,” he says. “But working on what we have right now and just gearing up more towards the community and growing it within this community is still number one.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1221a000d94e24d8f325ace38dd0edc63f511116/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4f89819a8fbe8f735dd4cfecddae9c0","title":"the traditional cash only bakery thats making dough after accepting cards","story":" It took Plum Duff bakery 45 years to embrace modern payments systems, but owner Ian Moore now reckons it’s a piece of cakeFor business owners who have relied for years on traditional ways of working, the prospect of embracing change and getting to grips with new technology can seem daunting. In reality, many new solutions are easy to incorporate and can transform the way businesses work, opening up a range of exciting opportunities.Plum Duff is run by chef Ian Moore, who has worked in some of the world’s top kitchens, such as London’s Dorchester hotel. He joined in 1989, becoming the bakery’s owner in 2004 and maintaining it as one of the last local shops in west London to bake everything on-site. Steeped in history, the patisserie is famous for its fresh breads, cakes, and pastries.The bakers was successful, but Moore became increasingly aware of the need to introduce modern payment technology. “Plum Duff had been a cash-only business since it opened its doors 45 years ago,” he says. “After serving customers who paid cash for so long, I was a little bit wary about taking card payments, but I also realised that Plum Duff needed to join the 21st century.”He discovered Square and its mobile-based point-of-sale (POS) system that allows anyone with a mobile device to accept card payments, anywhere, at any time. In January he took the plunge and signed up, and now uses the mobile-connected Square Reader to take credit and debit card payments, without the need for complex infrastructure. He admits that one of his initial concerns over switching to digital payments was how his staff would learn to use Square’s app, but says this proved unfounded. “It’s well-designed and easy for staff to pick up – not vastly different to something you’d use in your personal life, and very intuitive.”For those looking to extend customer payment options beyond face to face, there are opportunities to create an e-commerce store and take online payments. This can be done via one of Square’s partners, including BigCommerce, Wix, Weebly, and Ecwid, where an online store can be created quickly using premade templates and themes, with no coding required. Online stores can also be built via Square’s open source partners, WooCommerce, and Magento, which all have prebuilt Square integrations.Having transformed Plum Duff from a cash-only business to one with digital payment options, for now Moore is content with taking card payments in person. However, he is aware of the benefits that the platform can bring to the business via its additional commerce features. He says: “I’m well aware there’s a lot more that we can do with Square that we haven’t yet explored, for example, loading up the inventory so that we can see what we sell and when. Right now, though, we are just delighted to be able to take card payments, which is something our customers had been requesting for quite a while.”  The payment platform’s UK lead, Sarah Harvey, says: “We are confident that our simple to use, affordable, out-of-the-box solution has a great future here in the UK. In the year since our launch we have met so many small business owners who are benefiting from our technology.” And for many like Moore, who were under pressure to move with the times and bring their businesses into the digital age, there is the added benefit of discovering how easy it is to start using Square, regardless of any limitations to their technical knowhow. “Ian was wary of technology and the prospect of taking cards was daunting for him,” adds Harvey. “However, he realised that he was missing out on a lot of sales because people could only pay in cash. The technology was easy to set up and train staff on, he got his money the next working day, and it has proved fast, efficient and simple for him. The difference has been amazing.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2057ebaf6b28e4c535dfc7158fe1ffc2fac17a5/190_313_2522_1513/master/2522.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e445b72e2e5845c8472eecb0f786239","title":"meet the makers behind some of londons top market stalls","story":"From pork loins to concrete planters – traders at the capital’s fourth Urban Village Fete in Greenwich share their passions and productsThe Greenwich peninsula is undergoing a transformation from concrete jungle to a buzzing design and creative space. To celebrate this, each year the peninsula springs to life with music, colour and dancing, as creators from all over London come together for the Urban Village Fete. Curated by Wayne Hemingway, co-founder of Hemingway Design, the event delivers his vision of recreating the type of free festival that once attracted some of the brightest creative minds to Camden and Kensington markets.“Free festivals were the way we communicated,” he says. “There were loads of young designers who went on to become pretty famous. We want to recreate that in Greenwich: getting young creatives in front of tens of thousands of people at a price they can afford.”The fete is now in its fourth year and stretches through an area that is becoming a hub for design. Hemingway hopes that with 15,000 new homes, plus spaces designated for work and play, a sense of creativity and community will blossom on the peninsula, with creatives sharing the area with families. “The event feels generous, and generosity should be a part of urban life,” he says.Hemingway’s company produces dozens of festivals around the UK each year – from Liverpool’s Fine Tuned event to the National Festival of Making in Blackburn. One challenge facing market traders and craftspeople across these events is that shoppers are carrying less cash than ever. Hemingway Design and payments platform Square partnered to equip cash-only traders with Square Readers so they could take cards, many of them for the first time. Here, we meet some of the dozens of makers and creators who brought the Greenwich fete to life. Emily Griffin lives and breathes east London’s creative scene. A Hackney local for 20 years, during the past three she’s built her homewares and accessories business Mahala from the ground up. But while she makes and designs most of what can be found inside her store, the brand is also a family affair. “My husband joined Mahala a year ago and designs the clothes, which we have made in Bow,” says Griffin. “His aunt has a small orchard, so she makes all the lovely oils for us.” Mahala’s clothes and accessories are made to endure, reflecting the family’s thrifty past. Griffin uses military canvas and saddlery to create her bags, and her designs are centred around slow fashion. “I want people to have them for a really long time. I always repair stuff – I’d rather repair than replace,” she says.Building relationships with her customers at events such as the Urban Village Fete is key. “It means we’re not relying on footfall on our street, which is really quiet. Plus, we get to meet people from all over London and farther afield,” she says. The concrete planters found at From the Land (formerly Conpot) are far from the rigid grey slabs the material usually brings to mind. Architect Alastair Mitchell and textile designer Kezia Regan began experimenting in their home with planters made from concrete, before expanding to homewares and surfaces. “Each one uses a different stone source from around the country – Shropshire, Lancashire, Derbyshire – so we’re trying to show that concrete can have all these regional dialects,” says Mitchell.As the business grows, he says the aim is to move away from third-party retailers and sell more through his online store and specialist ceramic fairs, and at events like the Urban Village Fete. To do this, and to make the most of footfall, he has started using cashless payment platform Square. “If you only take cash, most people go away and never come back,” he says. “Just the other day we had someone come to our house who wanted to buy a planter. We were able to take a card payment in our living room.”Sarah Harvey, UK lead for Square, says: “None of us want to have to walk away from a unique item on a market stall just because that trader won’t accept cards, and with our partnership we wanted to make it as easy as possible for shoppers to support independent and creative businesses.” Ayse Özden loves creating with paper. She is one of the founders of WeAct, a London-based stationery store and brand agency with its roots in Turkey. “Greeting cards are a very big thing in Europe, whereas in Istanbul they’re not,” she says. Her family made the move to bring their collections to London two years ago. Her stall at the Urban Village Fete was filled with quirky designs from dictionary clippings underlying colourful illustrations designed by her husband to comical faces splashed across greeting cards and notebook covers. “There’s been a really nice response to the face collection,” she says. “Lots of people are laughing and that was our aim – to help people have fun.” Before making bespoke, one-of-a-kind bags to sell exclusively at markets, Anna P was designing 250-piece collections twice a year for high-street stores. Now she works for herself, and has spent three years collecting vintage textiles that she uses to design and make leather and cloth bags by hand. The designer prefers to sell to people direct, and doesn’t have an online store. Because of the nomadic nature of her stall, she makes sure she has a cashless payment system whenever she’s selling at markets. “I use Square and it’s so quick to take payments – if you have a lot of people and they all want to buy at the same time, just tap it on there and it’s done,” she says.  The bright pops of colour coming from the Keeler \u0026amp Sidaway stall captured the Urban Village Fete’s sunny, holiday vibes. Joe Keeler began his print and stationery company two years ago, as a way of combining his loves of illustration, photography and travelling – the latter of which inspires his art, which often features Californian poolsides and graphic beaches.“I’m an avid photographer, so I’ll take loads of photos and come back and draw from them, or sketch scenes while I’m on location and then work it all together from there,” he says.With a studio based in Bermondsey, Keeler sells his prints through his online store, but makes an exception when it comes to the urban village fete. “This one is the best summery festival things to do in London,” he says. “There are lots of people here.” Visitors to Imogen Johnson-Gilbert’s stall could try on her first collection, made at a Fairtrade factory in Bangalore, a new milestone for her business. Previously, Johnson-Gilbert made all of the Gillian June clothes herself, but the business’s popularity has made that tricky. “We’ve grown to a point where I’ve stopped being able to make it all,” she says.  Isabelle Laight really loves hip-hop, and at the Urban Village Fete she found she was in good company. “You can see everyone being really surprised when they walk past. It’s one of those things you don’t see that often,” she says of her illustrated designs of hip-hop and R\u0026ampB greats on the sides of mugs, plates, and stationery. “Kanye is the most popular. I don’t want him to be, but he is,” says Laight. “My favourite at the moment is Tupac – I’m going through a bit of a phase.” Using Square for payments at the fete, Laight says: “It’s really easy, I just keep it in my pocket, and there’s been no need to troubleshoot because I haven’t had any problems.” Sheffield native Alastair Mason knows a thing or two about pork. “It’s always been a family tradition that we have our pork brined or dipped by the butcher,” he says of his favourite snack. Mason started the Salty Loins food truck in 2015 through sheer frustration: he was unable to get a “decent” pork sandwich in London. “After raving to my friends about not being able to find this kind of pork, I decided to take it upon myself to experiment and came up with my own brine recipe.”Since then, the trained graphic designer has been a staple at London markets such as Maltby Street and Borough, as well as on the Bermondsey “beer mile”. Mason’s menu has expanded to incorporate one of his hometown’s favourite dishes – chips and gravy – plus baby back salt ribs, which he cooks up in front of hungry punters. “It’s good theatre when you’ve got a street food stall, obviously. That and the smell is key to people coming in and trying something new,” he says.Cathryn Quail’s stall on the peninsula looked straight out of the pages of a trendy interiors magazine – but she wants plants to be a part of a sustainable lifestyle rather than feeding an expensive trend. She opened The Botanical Workshop last September to sell plants and teach people how to arrange and take care of them. “It should be something that is affordable, that brings you joy and helps with mindfulness,” she says. “When you buy plants and they stay alive, it’s way more sustainable.”To curb the frustration generated by his bureaucratic job, where he was stuck at a desk each day, Ross Mitchell started curing food. Over three years, his hobby grew to become a business, now called Smoke and Cure. This was his first gig at the Urban Village Fete. “It is always good to meet a new bunch of customers. We were sitting right next to the music stage and among other peer businesses, so we were in good company,” he says.Mitchell has also learned that catering for card payments is now a necessity. “A year ago I wasn’t too fussed about using them, but what I found is it absolutely opens up a whole new line of business,” he says. “With Square you’re allowed to take payment over the phone, which is becoming increasingly important for our particular business.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebfb8206faa45b2f4c8c8b7d8c99f40e25dcfb90/126_153_2303_1382/master/2303.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83dcf0226ea47ad8dcb0711c63aef04c","title":"readers travel photography competition july the winners","story":"This month’s selection of travel imagery mixes quiet moments and superlative views.

Then one day in June, his life changed.  Ed Pilkington tells his storyThe placenta was the trickiest part. How to dispose of it without it making a mess that would alert the guards that a child had just been born in a prison cell?There was no medical equipment, no painkillers, no sterilized wipes or hygienic materials of any sort. When it came to cutting the umbilical cord in the absence of scissors, well, that was the easy part: just use your teeth.But Debbie Sims Africa was more stressed about the placenta. It was 1978, she was 22 years old and five weeks into what would turn out to be a 40-year prison sentence.She was determined to give birth on her own without any involvement of the jail officers so she could spend some precious time with the baby. In the end, a co-defendant helped her out, scooping up the placenta in her hands and secreting it to the shower room where she flushed it down the prison toilet.The plan worked. Debbie Africa got to spend three wonderful days with her baby son. She hid him under a sheet and when he cried, other jailed women would stand outside the cell and sing or cough to obscure the noise. She knew it couldn’t last, as jail rules prohibited mothers being with their children. At the end of the three days she informed the jailers of the baby’s existence and, once they had got over their astonishment, they arranged for the mother and son to be separated and for the child to be taken to the outside world. So begins the extraordinary life of Mike Africa Jr, a man born in a prison cell, and his incarcerated parents. As he approaches his 40th birthday in September, he reflects on what a crazy ride it’s been. He was born to a mother accused and later convicted of third-degree murder in one of the most dramatic confrontations with law enforcement of the 1970s black liberation struggle. Not only was Debbie Africa sentenced to 30 years to life for the death of a police officer, so too was her husband, Mike Africa Sr, father to Mike Jr, who was caught up in the same confrontation and given the same punishment.Which makes Mike Jr a penal orphan of the black power movement. For almost 40 years, he visited both his parents in separate penitentiaries but never saw either of them outside prison walls. Last month Debbie was finally released from prison on parole, but his father remains in captivity and to this day he has never seen the two of them together. Debbie and Mike Sr, both now 62, are two of the Move Nine, the group of black radicals who were collectively held responsible for the death of Officer James Ramp during a massive police shoot-out at their communal home in Powelton Village, Philadelphia on 8 August 1978. The group, whose members take “Africa” as their last name as a political badge, were resisting eviction.Move was one of the more extraordinary elements of the 1970s black liberation struggle. Deeply committed to fighting police brutality in African American communities, they were also devoted to caring for animals and the environment. They were like the Black Panthers crossed with nature-loving hippies. Black power meets flower power. They lived in a communal house along with dozens of stray dogs and cats where they would preach their political beliefs day and night at high volume through bullhorns, driving their neighbors to despair. Over time they came to be seen as dangerous non-conformists by the Philadelphia police and city government, leading to a drawn-out confrontation that culminated in the 1978 siege and gunfight involving hundreds of police that saw the death of Officer Ramp and sent nine of the black radicals to prison, potentially for life.The Move Nine were accused of firing the first shot and of killing Ramp. Yet they have always claimed innocence. They deny that they shot at anybody and blame the officer’s death on accidental “friendly fire” from other armed police. Ramp, 52, was a former marine who had served with the Philadelphia police department for 23 years. He was killed by a single bullet. Yet all nine Move members were convicted of his murder.I met Debbie Africa and her son as part of research into incarcerated black radicals that began more than two years ago. The starting point was the Angola Three, former Black Panthers who had endured unprecedented stretches in solitary confinement in Louisiana’s notorious Angola prison.That began a journey that would bring me to interview several members of the Move Nine as well as former Black Panthers and members of the Black Liberation Army who remain incarcerated in some cases half a century after their arrests. It would culminate with a day spent with Debbie and Mike Jr, mother and son, as they celebrated their first time together beyond prison walls.Debbie Africa was eight months pregnant during the 1978 siege. During the shoot-out she was holed out in the basement of the Move house, where she was bombarded by water cannons and tear gas and had to fumble her way out in the dark carrying her first child, her two-year-old daughter Michelle.No evidence was presented at trial that she pulled the trigger or ever touched a gun. But she was convicted nonetheless as a murderer and conspirator.Mike Sr remains behind bars in Graterford correctional institution in Pennsylvania. But last June, Debbie Africa became one of very few black liberationists convicted of violent acts from the 1970s to be released on parole having convinced the board she was no threat to society.Debbie and Mike Jr talked to me at his home in a small town outside Philadelphia just two weeks after she had been released on parole from Cambridge Springs prison. They were both still clearly awestruck to be in each other’s company after so long – Mike’s sporadic prison visits to both his parents were nothing like this.It’s the little things that have dumbfounded Mike Jr most. The first morning after they got back to his house, they were sitting at breakfast wearing no shoes.“It was the first time I’ve ever seen her feet, and it was the first time she’d ever seen my feet since I was three days old in her cell,” he said.Debbie Africa described waves of overpowering emotion. “I can’t believe this is happening,” she said. “I’ll just start hugging him in the supermarket and people will be giving us strange looks.”She talked about the wrench of letting her son go when he was three days old. “It was a hard, hard decision. I wanted what was best for him and I knew that was not to get close to me at any level. So I had to break the bond.”Mike Jr was raised during his childhood by his grandmother and by a succession of different female members of the Move organization as part of its communal ethic. “I was a community kid, I had many mothers,” Mike Jr said in a deadpan voice, as though describing the weather.Every Mother’s Day he makes the rounds of his “mothers”. He drives around bearing cards and flowers which he drops off at the homes of at least six women. He rattled off their names: Bert, Sue, Romana, Pam, Mary, Teresa. Now he’ll be able to put flowers in the hands of his true birth mother. He had no idea who she was, nor who his father was, until he was about six or seven when their relationship to him was made clear to him.“I didn’t know she was in prison, I didn’t know any of it. I thought that the person caring for me was my mother.”He looks back on his childhood and recognizes that some aspects of his upbringing were less than ideal. “Who teaches a kid how to brush his teeth or take a bath but his parents. I didn’t know how to wash my hair ’til I was 15.”Through his childhood he was taken to visit both parents in separate prisons, maybe once or twice a year. But for years he had no idea why they were locked up. When friends at school asked about him about them, he would demur or make up stories because he was embarrassed to reveal his ignorance.It was only when he was 14 and sitting with his father in Graterford that the penny dropped. He asked Mike Sr whether there was anybody held in the prison who had done something really bad, like killing somebody.“He didn’t go on to explain,” Mike Jr recalled. “I was frightened. Was he going to be in here forever? I was crying my eyes out trying to figure it out, but I couldn’t explain to him why I was crying. I couldn’t put it into words.”Mikr Jr said it took him years to put the pieces together. “I was left to figure it out for myself, to fend for myself.”But neither son nor mother are ones to dwell on the wounds of the past. I asked Debbie Africa whether she regretted that by her actions as a black liberationist and Move member she had put her son through so much pain.“There are always going to be things in my life that I wish didn’t happen,” she said. “I do truly wish that what happened to my son hadn’t happened, I do truly. But I look at the man he is now, and I love it.”Having spent two days in the company of Mike Africa Jr outside Philadelphia, I can see what she means. He has turned out remarkably poised for someone with his chaotic childhood résumé.He runs his own small business as a landscape gardener, is married and has four children of his own. He is a proud member of Move, has never owned or even held a gun, and his house is comfortable and full of light, though it was notable how much neater it was the second time I visited following Debbie’s release. At last she has begun fulfilling that ritual of parents everywhere: tidying up after their child’s mess.On Mike Jr’s part he’s similarly delighted his mother has turned out as well-balanced, sociable and positive as she is, given 40 years in correctional institutions. “I feel relief. Big relief. I never knew she would come out alive. When people come out of prison they can be sick in the head, but this transition of her coming to my house has been the smoothest major transformation of my life.”Now the challenge is to help Mike Africa Sr secure parole, and so complete the family. His next appearance before the parole board is in September, and they are all already on tenterhooks.A paradox of Debbie Africa’s release is that under her parole terms she is not able to communicate in any form with her husband because he is classified as a co-defendant and thus is out of bounds. The last time they saw each other in the flesh was in 1986. Since then they had been allowed to write to each other from their cells, and in that way managed to keep their bond alive.Now that the letter-writing has been stopped all they have in terms of connection is Mike Jr acting as a go-between. He lets each parent know how the other is doing. He also acted as my go-between, putting questions to his father which Mike Sr answered in a phone call to him. How confident is Mike Sr, I asked, as he heads into the parole hearing?“I’m confident that I’m going to tell the truth. I’m confident that I deserve parole. I’m confident I would never be considered a danger to the community ever again. We never intended for anyone to get hurt, and regret that anyone did get hurt.”Then he added: “What I’m not confident about is what they’re going to do, I have no control over that.”He said the knowledge that his wife was now at home with his son and daughter was a great comfort to him. But it also heightened his desire to be with them all.“Forty years of wanting, anticipating. It’s like Double Dutch. You’re always on the edge of that jump rope, hopping up and down, waiting to get in, waiting for your turn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb69a66f0fb4d15dba02aa617e98c915b855ce10/0_0_3071_1843/master/3071.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94e98b0bc86f5e91c69d6438b4538c3b","title":"zimbabwe votes first post mugabe election pictures","story":" Voters are casting their ballots in the country’s first election since the authoritarian leader was ousted last year.

Dr Ruth Caden completed her general practice training in rural Ireland, witnessing the ever-increasing workload with reduced resources that her GP colleagues were facing.“They could often not take holidays as there was no cover, they would do unpaid house calls in the evenings after work. Although they did it largely without complaint, I could see how this could lead to burnout,” Caden says.“The GPs I worked with were tireless in their work for their communities and invested heavily in their practices, some in primary care centres, only for the Government to unilaterally slash the practice income by 38 per cent.”Caden worked in Ireland for six years before leaving for Vancouver Island, Canada. Remuneration and working conditions for GPs are better in places such as Canada and Australia, according to Caden. But if the Government was to make a serious commitment to changing working conditions for GPs, she would consider returning.“So far, unfortunately I have seen nothing to show that they are serious about this, and I have a significant concern that general practice as we know it will be killed off by this Government. This will impact on the poorest and most vulnerable, who disproportionately rely on general practice.”Last home for a holiday in October, Caden sees little hope of returning as working conditions for GPs remain difficult.Dr Dermot Coffey was easily persuaded to leave his homeland in 2002 with his partner due to the “awful working hours” for doctors in Ireland at the time.“The conditions weren’t even the worst they had been – we at least got paid for the hours we worked – but I remember working out we averaged 78 hours a week that whole year, and every fourth week was 100 hours,” he says.Coffey and his partner (now wife) headed for New Zealand where they live with their three children, despite a few stints working in Ireland in 2004 and 2009.A recent holiday to Ireland prompted him to think about his reasons for leaving and roused mixed feelings on returning.“Like a lot of people I imagine I’ve felt the pull back a lot more strongly since we’ve had kids, and although I’ve a brother and his family out here now, the distance seems a lot further than it did when we moved 16 years ago,” he says.“I’ve never been one to hold with the view that medicine is a ‘vocation’, or that Irish graduates should be bonded to the country, but I have felt in more recent times a feeling that we as medics should all be chipping in to help the Irish health system, and a desire to make whatever little difference I could has added to the drawback.”Coffey finished his GP training in 2007, worked as a GP in Wellington until 2016 and has just returned to work in Christchurch after spending two years in Melbourne, where his wife completed training as a geneticist.“Would I come back? I would. I wouldn’t expect perfection but I’d like to see some hope for general practice first.”Motivated less by a desire to avoid the challenging working conditions in Ireland and more by a yearning to care for some of the world’s poorest populations, Commandant Dr Patrick Kelly joined the Defence Forces in 2014 after completing his GP training in Ireland.Kelly is acting senior medical officer with the UN’s Quick Reaction Force, and will leave Syria for a holiday in Ireland in August. He will enjoy a three-week break here before returning to the Golan Heights as part of the UN mission, hosted by the Syrian Arab Republic.The Waterford native became a member of the Order of Malta aged 12 and grew to appreciate caring for people and the human element of healthcare.“A career in the Defence Forces has offered me the opportunity to provide healthcare to people who really need it refugees, internally displaced populations or to persons living in resource-poor settings. I’ve been able to care for various groups from orphans of the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone to internally displaced persons as a result of the Syrian civil war.His current role is to provide for the primary care needs of 130 soldiers, as well as preventing the outbreak of disease, which can occur in people situated in close quarters.His other role is as a doctor of the Quick Reaction Force, which is in effect an emergency service for UN unarmed military observers who are overseeing the area of separation between Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic as part of the UNDOF mandate.Kelly says he may one day consider working in Irish general practice, but for now, on the whole, enjoys the variety offered by his work abroad.“You miss family events, but you have to take the good with the bad,” he says.Dr Cróchán O’Sullivan, consultant interventional cardiologist, returned home to live in Ireland in recent weeks after spending seven years working in Switzerland.The Kildare native graduated in medicine in 2004. Since then he has moved city and country 11 times.In 2011, he went to Switzerland. O’Sullivan wanted to be an interventional cardiologist and there was no training opportunities in Ireland.“The main reason people move is for training, I think,” he says.“When you’re training in Ireland you have a very pessimistic outlook of the future . . . I didn’t see any future in Ireland. I felt that I had to go abroad and make the most of it over there.”Amid the pessimism and lack of training opportunities in his chosen speciality O’Sullivan, a qualified doctor, made the difficult decision to move abroad to train, unpaid.“When you move abroad first you don’t get paid, you don’t get a salary for working for the hospital and have to find your own funding. When I moved to Switzerland first I got a grant from the HSE that lasted a year . . . then I was lucky to get another grant for a year.”Last year, he and his wife had a child, which he says “was the impetus for us to come home”.Looking for a job in Ireland, he spoke to “very disillusioned” colleagues working in the public sector due to consultant pay concerns and limited resources.Having specialised in innovative, new valve procedures in Zurich, O’Sullivan wanted to continue this work in Ireland and private hospitals, with superior resources, offered better opportunities, he says.He has taken up a role in the Bon Secours Hospital Cork and is excited about the positive outlook there. Whereas the outlook within the public sector “appeared to be more negative”, he says.Irish academic fellow in geriatric medicine Dr Mary Ní Lochlainn, who works for the National Health Service in London, says she cannot “imagine ever not being paid for my work or having to chase my due pay” unlike her Irish counterparts.Ní Lochlainn has never worked for the HSE and has only been in Irish hospitals as a medical student, but even as a patient here found the two-tier health system “very troubling”.She chose to move abroad for a number of reasons.“I was influenced by many fantastic consultants in geriatric medicine as a medical student in Trinity, all of whom had spent time training in the UK. So I definitely felt I would go to the UK at some point. I also moved for the training opportunities and to experience the NHS, as well as the more forgiving hours and better working conditions.“The NHS is the most incredible system, I feel deeply privileged to work there. Money is never a consideration in my day-to-day clinical work, nobody mentions insurance, and everyone gets the same treatment regardless of their classcolourcreedbank balance. It is not perfect, with Tory-underfunding, but nevertheless it is a phenomenal institution.”Ní Lochlainn, like junior doctors in Ireland, must move hospitals as part of her training post. But, she only moves between hospitals in south London.“I don’t have to move to opposite ends of the country away from loved ones, moving house regularly, etc. This is a big consideration of mine when I think about moving home,” she says.Most importantly, she believes unequal pay for consultants is a huge factor for Irish doctors abroad. “Why should those of us who qualified later be penalised and paid less for the same work?” she asks. “It is utterly demoralising. I worry about my parents and extended family being in Ireland where the waiting lists are ever growing. Unless we sort out this demoralisation, there will be more empty posts, and no doctors to clear these waiting lists.“I’m not sure the general public realise that they are the ones who will suffer if these issues are not resolved by Government as soon as possible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Anti-abortion group says strategy to oppose legalisation should use religious argumentResidents had challenged \u0026lsquofast-track\u0026rsquo decision on development of 500 homes on pitchesTwo options drawn up to avoid closure of road linking Ranelagh and RathminesPassengers complained of pain despite paramedics\u0026rsquo evidence of little vehicle damageJoan Freeman, Gavin Duffy and Patrick Feeney make their pitches to local authorityBoard and developer expect Raheny project to be subject of further legal actionVaradkar confirms all 221 women will qualify for compensationSinn F\u0026eacutein leader does apparent U-turn after previously saying it was not the right climateHealthier diet lowers anxiety and reduced stress levels can aid \u0026lsquoleaky\u0026rsquo gut problemsDue process has been followed and the law must take its course, says justice ministerDriver later convicted of careless driving causing death didn\u0026rsquot know he had hit Stefan Cooper (18)Inquest hears 41 year old motorcyclist died after colliding with large bales of hayCampaign slogan \u0026lsquois about bringing a positive spin to a term that is negative\u0026rsquoTaoiseach says the main thing is the measure must guarantee no hard Border post-BrexitApplication allowing challenge to Yes vote rejected by three judges of Court of Appeal\u0026lsquoPeople throw eggs and rubbish at the windows and doors.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneIt all comes back to the legislation.The lack of clarity in the Electoral Acts around funding, foreign donations and the definition of political purposes is the one area all interested parties agree on in the Amnesty International v Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo) High Court case.Yesterday the court quashed a ruling, made in November 2017, that Amnesty International should refund a €137,000 donation from the Open Society Foundations funded by international financier and philanthropist George Soros.Sipo accepted that its decision the donation was for political purposes and must be returned was “procedurally flawed” and is making a €16,000 contribution to Amnesty’s legal costs.The donation was made in 2015 and Amnesty said it was to fund the agency’s 2016 campaign to increase public support for repealing the Eighth Amendment on abortion.Under the Electoral Acts (1997, amended in 2001) donations above €100 must be declared to Sipo, the State’s public ethics watchdog.Donations from outside Ireland are banned unless from an Irish citizen.Anti-abortion campaign groups repeatedly highlighted the donation as illegal and a foreign influence on the abortion referendum campaign.Amnesty International Ireland said the funding was related to work that was targeted at the Government rather than the electorate.The objectives included increasing support among politicians for the holding of a referendum. No referendum on the Eighth Amendment was planned or had been called when the donation was made, Amnesty said.Subsequently, media reports on documents leaked from the Soros-funded foundation suggested that the funding was part of a strategy to force the repeal of the amendment.Sipo, in November 2017, then wrote to Amnesty referring to obligations under the Electoral Act and said it had to refund the donation.Amnesty claimed it and other non-governmental organisations were extremely concerned about the implications of the decision.It feared the matter could be referred to the Garda, leading to a possible criminal prosecution, if it did not return the donation and it challenged the Sipo ruling in the High Court.The settlement between the parties centres on that concept that it was “procedurally flawed”.In December last year Sipo issued a statement in which it said it “sought and received written confirmation from the donor that the funding was for explicitly political purposes”.But the Open Society Foundations refuted the allegation and said it “has provided no such confirmation to Sipo, and we have written to the regulator requesting that they correct any public statements to the contrary”.Welcoming the resolution of its legal challenge, Amnesty International Ireland’s executive director Colm O’Gorman said the agency’s primary concern was with the law and the “vague wording” and “overly broad application of the Electoral Act”.Sipo itself has pointed out that the wording is open to a range of interpretations and, in response to the case, renewed its repeated calls – the first in 2003 – for the 1997 and 2001 Electoral Acts to be amended.Last week, its annual report called for amending legislation and for an electoral commission to be established, highlighting the advent of more referendums and the potential for foreign-financed and influenced digital campaigns.John McGuirk, formerly of the Save the 8th campaign, said it was important to note that the findings were that Sipo’s decision making was “procedurally flawed”.McGuirk, speaking in a personal capacity, said: “It’s tremendously unfortunate that the actual point of law doesn’t appear to have been clarified.”Deirdre Garvey, chief executive of the national association of charities The Wheel, said that lack of clarity could “potentially muzzle legitimate and important voices in civil society, including community organisations, non-profits, charities and international NGOs when making representations to government”.The Department of Local Government in its response to the case said plans are “advanced” for the establishment of an electoral commission. Proposals are “anticipated” to be brought to Government in the autumn.Once established the commission will have responsibility for the whole area of funding, foreign donations and campaigns.O’Gorman has been sharply criticised for failing to return the funding and for taking the case. But by doing so he has brought the issue centre stage and the State, after 15 years of appeals by Sipo as ethics watchdog, is finally acting."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3582371.1533063721!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leo varadkar government can be flexible on backstop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar  pictured during a media briefing at Government Buildings. Photograph: Tom HonanThe Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has stressed that the Government is prepared to be “flexible” on the exact content of the Border “backstop” but would not compromise on what it must achieve.Mr Varadkar made the comments while speaking to journalists on Tuesday at a briefing at Government Buildings.“When it comes to the backstop, our position has always been what matters is not the detailed legal text, it’s the outcome, and so what we want the backstop to achieve is a guarantee that there won’t be a hard Border between Northern Ireland and Ireland,” Mr Varadkar said.He said that while the Government was “totally enthusiastic” about solving the problem of the post-Brexit Border when the EU and the UK agree on a future relationship, the Irish Government would not back down on its insistence that the backstop is part of a withdrawal treaty between the UK and EU – due to be agreed by mid-October.In the absence of a withdrawal treaty, the UK is scheduled to leave the EU next March without a transition period – meaning that EU laws and agreements would cease to apply to the UK overnight.The backstop agreed between the EU and UK last December provides for regulatory alignment between the Republic and Northern Ireland in order to avoid customs checks. It would come into effect in the absence of a wider Brexit deal providing for a frictionless Border.“We have to have the backstop as well. We have to have that assurance that unless and until a new solution is in place, that there won’t be a Border.“But yes, we can be flexible certainly on the content of it so long as the outcome is the one that we need,” Mr Varadkar said.Senior Government sources said they expect little progress on Brexit in the coming weeks, but that the UK and EU negotiating teams would restart talks in the middle of August in the hope of reaching a breakthrough on the Border issue in September.Sources acknowledge that the British ask – to have the UK effectively remain in the single market for goods – would have advantages for Ireland, but say it is unlikely to be accepted by Paris or Berlin, as it would compromise the EU’s single market rules.Mr Varadkar also indicated that the Irish and British governments will make another push in the autumn to bring the Northern parties back to the table at Stormont, with a view to resuscitating the powersharing institutions before the end of the year.“We would intend in the autumn some time trying again to get the parties in Northern Ireland together. I think the absence of any clarity around Brexit makes that very difficult, but if we can have that in October, I think there is an opportunity certainly before the end of the year to get the assembly and executive up and running,” he said.He said that\u0026nbspa Border poll at this time would be “very isive and unsuccessful”.“Now is not the time to get into all that,” Mr Varadkar said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Yeshiel PanchiaEPA Zimbabwe’s ruling Zanu-PF party won the majority of seats in parliament after sweeping rural constituencies by huge margins, official results showed on Wednesday. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission results showed President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s Zanu-PF cruising to a big majority after picking up 109 seats against 41 for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Another 58 seats are yet to be declared. The House of Assembly of Parliament has 210 seats and Zanu-PF would need to win 30 more to have a two-thirds majority that would allow it to change the constitution at will. Voters in Zimbabwe pick a presidential candidate based on their party affiliation and the trend in the parliamentary election was expected to continue when results for the president are announced this week. The opposition MDC, led by Nelson Chamisa, won in most urban centres, where it enjoys majority support. The MDC accused the election commission on Tuesday of deliberately delaying results of this week’s vote to favour the ruling party, reporting irregularities in the first poll since the removal of Robert Mugabe in a bloodless November coup. Even though the election passed off peacefully, several water cannon trucks patrolled outside the central Harare headquarters of the MDC as its red-shirted supporters danced in the streets. Although millions of Zimbabweans voted peacefully in Monday’s historic election, the situation began to deteriorate within 24 hours because of the commission’s refusal to release preliminary presidential results. In response, the MDC publicly declared that its own parallel count showed that its candidate, Nelson Chamisa, had easily beaten Mr Mnangagwa. The move by the MDC Alliance, which comprises five opposition parties, prompted hundreds of its supporters to start wildly celebrating their side’s victory outside its headquarters in Zimbabwe’s capital.During a press conference to announce its victory and outline the rigging concerns, the MDC Alliance’s Tendai Biti said: “The results show beyond reasonable doubt that we have won the election and that the next president of Zimbabwe is Nelson Chamisa”.Mr Biti also claimed that the vice-president - retired General Constantino Chiwenga - who led the military takeover that forced former president Robert Mugabe to resign last November, had issued a directive for the assassination of Mr Chamisa and himself.

Photograph: Alain JocardAFPGetty ImagesBritain’s foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has appealed over the heads of Brussels negotiators directly to France and Germany to try to force the European Commission to strike a “sensible and pragmatic” Brexit deal.Ahead of talks with his opposite number in Paris, Mr Hunt accused Brussels of waiting for Britain “to blink” in negotiations as he claimed the chances of the UK leaving the EU without a deal were “increasing by the day”.“That is just a profound misunderstanding of us as a nation,” he said. “There is a real chance of no deal by accident. Everyone is assuming, no, no, no, this will never happen. Well, actually, it could.”Mr Hunt’s warning came as the Élysée Palace announced that British prime minister Theresa May will join French president Emmanuel Macron at his summer home, Fort de Brégançon, in the south of France on Friday when her holiday in the Italian lakes comes to an end.Ms May’s office confirmed that the pre-planned visit would include talks on the prime minister’s Chequers deal but that the pair would then be joined by Philip May and the president’s wife, Brigitte Macron, for a private dinner.In an interview before his trip to France, Mr Hunt warned the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, that his approach to the negotiations would inflict a “breakdown in relations and trust” between Britain and the continent which would be a “profound geo-strategic mistake”.He told the Evening Standard: “The probability of no deal is increasing by the day until we see a change of approach from the European Commission who have this view that they just need to wait and Britain will blink ...“France and Germany have to send a strong signal to the commission that we need to negotiate a pragmatic and sensible outcome that protects jobs on both sides of the Channel because for every job lost in the UK, there will be jobs lost in Europe as well if Brexit goes wrong.”However, Brussels insiders have repeatedly pointed out that Mr Barnier and his Brussels negotiating team are only acting on the orders of France, Germany and the rest of the 27 EU countries. Any inflexibility originates from the nation states.France has taunted the UK by offering to roll out the red carpet to British-based financial firms after Brexit, but Mr Hunt said a no-deal Brexit would be an economic “tragedy” for both countries.“If it became harder for European businesses to access finance, that is far from trivial,” he said, alluding to the flow of money from the City of London, which could become more difficult to access if there was no agreement.“The City itself would find a way to thrive, whatever the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.

Victoria and Gatwick Airport were delayed, with the majority due to reasons within the operator\u0026#39s controlGatwick Express must no longer claim it runs non-stop to Victoria station in half an hour and in just 30 minutes after advertising watchdogs found one in five trains is delayed.The Advertising Standards Authority ruled the claims were misleading customers after it found that 20.1 per cent of Gatwick Express trains between London Victoria and Gatwick Airport were delayed, with the majority due to reasons within the operator\u0027s control.The Gatwick Express charges a premium above other slower trains on the same route, on the basis that it offers the fastest service. The ASA\u0027s decision comes after two separate complaints that a poster and website for the service, seen in March and featuring the claim that the journey took 30 minutes, were misleading.Train delays are at their highest for a decadeGovia Thameslink Railway, trading as Gatwick Express, said a total of 79.1 per cent of scheduled trains between Victoria and Gatwick arrived at their final destination on time between April 30 and May 26.It listed three unforeseeable exceptions to the planned services - if access was required for engineering work, if there was a failure with infrastructure such as signalling or points, or if there was an unavoidable incident such as a passenger falling ill - and said they were contractually obliged to adjust services for safety reasons such as speed restrictions.It also argued that it was difficult to mitigate against certain causes of delays such as staff sickness, and said any driver involved in an operational incident had to take a set amount of time off work.The ASA said consumers would expect Gatwick Express to achieve the stated journey time barring exceptional or unforeseeable circumstances outside their control.10 simple secrets to saving money on UK rail faresIt said: Whilst we acknowledged that a proportion of services were delayed due to exceptional or unforeseeable circumstances outside of Gatwick Express\u0027s control, such as track faults, fatalities and power supply failures, we considered that a significant proportion of services were delayed for reasons that were within Gatwick Express\u0027s control.As such, we concluded that the claims \u0027Non-stop to Victoria station in half an hour\u0027 and \u0027in just 30 minutes\u0027 had not been substantiated and were misleading.It ruled that the ads must not appear again, adding: We told Gatwick Express to remove the claims \u0027Non-stop to Victoria station in half an hour\u0027 and \u0027in just 30 minutes\u0027 unless they could achieve that journey time in most cases, save for exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances outside of Gatwick Express\u0027s control.Gatwick Express is part of the Govia Thameslink Railway franchise, which also includes Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern.The operator has suffered major disruption on certain routes in recent years caused by a number of factors, including industrial disputes, a shortage of drivers, infrastructure failures and the introduction of new timetables on May 20. Please review our commenting

victory amid zimbabwean election delays","story":"Supporters cheer as they gather at the MDC Alliance headquarters in HarareZimbabwe’s government has warned candidates could be jailed for prematurely announcing election results after Nelson Chamisa’s opposition MDC Alliance claimed to have won the general election and suggested it would call supporters on to the streets if the official result favoured Emmerson Mnangagwa, the president.Mr Chamisa, a 40-year-old lawyer and preacher, said he was “winning resoundingly” as counting got under way and called on the country’s electoral commission to “perform their constitutional duty to officially announce the people’s election results”.But Zimbabwe’s electoral authorities had announced the results from just seven parliamentary constituencies by Tuesday evening, and made no comment on the outcome of the presidential race.Zimbabwean law forbids anyone other than the electoral commission from announcing results.“As a government we have noted with concern the actions and conduct of some political party leaders... who are openly declaring that they will announce results irrespective of provisions of the law,” said Obert Mpofu, the home affairs minister, at a media briefing in Harare.“I am sure no one wants to provoke the wrath of the law and risk being sent to jail.” Electoral officials and the country’s main observer organisation reported an unprecedented 80 per cent turnout in Zimbabwe’s first presidential, parliamentary, and local government elections since Robert Mugabe was ousted in a military coup in November. Zimbabwean law says official results must be released within five days of the poll.If no candidate in the presidential race wins more than 50 per cent of the vote there will be a run-off on Sept 8.Justice Priscilla Chigumba, chairman of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC), said Tuesday evening that Zanu PF had won seven seats in the 210-member parliament and the MDC Alliance one.She said the presidential result would not be released until returns from more than 10,000 polling station had been collated. But the delay drew allegations of fraud from the MDC, which insisted it already had proof from polling station observers that it had won the election and accused officials of delaying publication in order to falsify the vote.Zimbabweans check the results posted outside a polling station in Bulawayo“We have been pushing ZEC to announce the results. The results are posted outside of polling stations. We have collected those results,” said Tendai Biti, a former MDC finance minister who ousted the Zanu PF incumbent in Harare East on Monday.Asked whether the opposition would attempt to challenge the result with peaceful protests, he said: “Constitutionally it is the right of every Zimbabwean to come out on to the streets.”The election commission said it had seen no evidence of cheating and that it was operating strictly within the law.A senior Zanu PF member who spoke on condition of anonymity said Mr Mnangagwa had clearly secured the presidency and that the ruling party would maintain a parliamentary majority.But he conceded that Mr Chamisa appeared to have done “better than we had hoped” and that it was unclear whether Zanu PF would achieve its goal of a two-thirds majority, which would allow it to amend the constitution.Emmerson Mnangagwa attends a rally in Harare, Zimbabwe, on July 28, 2018There were no disturbances reported in Harare last night. However, a large crowd of MDC supporters gathered outside the opposition headquarters to celebrate “victory” while riot police equipped with water cannons were seen patrolling in city centre.Meanwhile, Mr Biti accused Gen Constantino Chiwenga, the vice president and mastermind of the coup that ousted Mr Mugabe, of ordering the assassination of Mr Chamisa and himself. George Charamba, the spokesman for Mr Mnangagwa, called the allegation “bizarre.”The vote has been seen as a key test of Mr Mnangagwa’s willingness to break with the violence and corruption of Mr Mugabe’s 37-year rule.Africa\u0026#039s tarnished jewel: how four decades of Robert Mugabe left Zimbabwe\u0026#039s economy reelingForeign diplomats have told the Zimbabwean government that it may be readmitted to the Commonwealth and could see relief from US sanctions that currently prevent IMF loans if the election passes off peacefully and without cheating.However, whoever wins the vote will inherit a crisis-ridden economy with an unemployment rate of up to  90 per cent and a critical shortage of hard currency.Please review our commenting policyComment: From smart meters to the Millennium Dome, why is Britain so uniquely awful at big projects?Comment: The Government is being shamefully flippant about our school exclusions crisisDavid Mundell: SNP and Tory ministers need to stop rowing and \u0026#39pull together\u0026#39 to exploit Brexit trade benefitsPassengers escape death as AeroMexico plane crashes in Durango, MexicoUS judge blocks release of 3D gun blueprints amid uproarBBC don\u0026#39t televise Monty Python today because it shows how bad modern comedy is, John Cleese claimsRussian journalists killed in Central African RepublicBreast cancer treatment can double heart risks   Gatwick Express told to ditch \u0026#39Get there in 30 minutes\u0026#39 claim as one in five services is delayed NHS mortuaries so lax families are at \u0026#39significant risk\u0026#39 of burying the wrong bodies, watchdog finds  Jeremy Corbyn issues personal apology as anti-Semitism row boils overWarning over link between depression and video game addiction after MRI scan shows proof Health Secretary accused of ignoring dementia Calais Jungle child refugees denied UK entry because Home Office denied them right to appealPlay centre chaos: \u0026#39Major incident\u0026#39 after man in Bradford \u0026#39storms building and falls from height\u0026#39Comment: Let\u0026#39s end the disgraceful treatment of ex-British soldiers over Bloody Sunday\u0026#39Betrayal\u0026#39 of British soldier interrogated by police over Bloody Sunday \u0026#39attempted murder\u0026#39Comment: While IRA terrorists sit at home relaxed, ageing British soldiers live in trepidationRoad rage murder: Manhunt after father is beaten to death on his doorstep after clash with motoristWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/14/TELEMMGLPICT000001859188_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqT1yghX8zbx7fxQBY89c64XuNz4jGHGsSQrNbcoF3ur4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"uk government publishes first bio security strategy","story":"Britain must help developing countries to stop new disease outbreaks to prevent deadly epidemics, the Government saysPandemics and epidemicsA deadly disease outbreak like a flu epidemic is one of the worst civil emergencies the country could face and Britain must help developing countries to stop new outbreaks, the Government has said.A flu epidemic in the UK could cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and cost tens of billions of pounds, while disease outbreaks overseas can spread insecurity, harm trade and increase migration, according to the Government\u0027s first biological security strategy.Global migration towards mega cities, international travel and the growing demand for meat in much of the world all make it easier for new diseases to spread worldwide.The spread of biological knowledge and techniques online also means a growing potential for terrorists to try to carry out a biological attack.At the same time the growth of microbe resistance to antibiotics could kill ten million a year more each year around the world..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Disease outbreaks that begin overseas, as seen with the Ebola epidemic, can quickly affect the UK and UK interestsHome Office document“Significant outbreaks of disease are among the highest impact risks faced by any society,” said Ben Wallace, the security minister, “threatening lives and causing disruption to public services and the economy.”The 46-page Home Office document says Britain cannot sit behind its borders to secure itself against biological threats.“These diseases are not limited by international borders. Disease outbreaks that begin overseas, as seen with the Ebola epidemic, can quickly affect the UK and UK interests.“This impact can be either direct, or indirect through the loss of regional stability negatively affecting trade, causing migration pressures and creating ungoverned spaces in which terrorism and criminality can flourish.”Pandemics | The cost of a global outbreakThe plan says UK aid that builds up health services in the world\u0027s poorest countries goes “to protecting UK citizens from significant disease threats and securing the UK’s long term national security.”Any new deadly epidemic is likely to come from an animal disease infecting humans. Around 60 per cent of all human diseases and three quarters of all new and emerging infectious diseases are these zoonotic diseases. Recent examples include Ebola and H5N1 bird flu.As growing populations encroach on natural habitats and developing countries demand more animal foods, there will be increasing overlap between humans, domestic livestock and wildlife that could see new diseases jump from one group to another.An outbreak infecting UK livestock of crops could also be highly costly and damaging, the strategy says.Global health - Major threats to UK populationThe strategy says that a deliberate biological attack on the UK is currently judged unlikely. But it says such an attack on the UK or its armed forces “are aspects of this risk picture that may become more likely over the longer term”.Conflicts or economic crises also risk increasing the threat from diseases as health services collapse and immunisation programmes halt for diseases such as polio, diptheria and measlesIn the long term, “climate change will also increase the likelihood of pests and vector-borne diseases spreading to new areas of the globe, as they and their carriers are able to survive in countries where environments would previously not have supported their circulation”.Mr Wallace said: “Britain is a global nation, open to the world and outward facing. This means we are exposed to these risks, both at home and overseas, but it also gives us the opportunity to work with international partners to tackle such threats at source.”Protect yourself and

Manufacturers and TradersClick to followThe Independent OnlineNo UK car manufacturer ready for Brexit, industry warnsThe British motor industry has warned that “no one would confess to being Brexit ready” in their trade.\u0026nbspMike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), argues that his members are “increasingly concerned” about the prospects for the UK leaving the EU on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms, in the light of developments since Theresa May published the government’s latest Brexit white paper, which he and the SMMT welcomed.Michel\u0026nbspBarnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has since expressed scepticism about the proposed Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA), which would have been of particular value to manufacturing and the automotive sector.In the light of EU resistance, and growing UK political volatility, the chances of the UK going to a “no deal” exit are increasing, meaning that Britain would move to WTO terms, as opposed to staying in the Single Market, the customs union or the FCA.This would imply tariffs of up to 10 per cent in UK-EU trade in cars and parts, and greater bureaucracy in both directions, which would only be partly mitigated by “stockpiling” in the short run, given the demands of “just in time” manufacturing techniques and integrated cross-border supply chains.There is a tail risk that factory production of models such as the Mini at BMW’s plant in Oxford could be disrupted if crucial car components become unavailable.\u0026nbspMr Hawes\u0026nbspadded that the prospect of a “no deal” Brexit was something no-one wished to see and that industry leaders wished to see “all options open as long as possible”.\u0026nbspReflecting on the 1,100 trucks that enter the UK from Europe every day to feed its factories, he said that the eight months remaining until formal Brexit on 29 March 2019 were “a real challenge”.\u0026nbspBritish car production for the home market almost halved in June, compared to the same month a year ago, due to what the industry calls “a perfect storm” of factors that resulted in a freakish result.Landmark EU-Japan deal puts pressure on UK over car manufacturing jobsTrump tariffs could cost Alabama car industry 20,000 jobs, warn unionsGovernment urged to stop ‘squabbling’ and save UK car industryInvestment in UK car industry halves because of BrexitOverall, UK manufacture of cars was just 3.3 per cent down in the year to the end of June 2018, buoyed by exceptionally high demand for British products in certain export destinations, notably Japan (up 77.3 per cent), Korea (up 67.8 per cent) and relatively stable demand in China, the US\u0026nbspand Europe.\u0026nbspAmerica is the biggest single national market for British automotive exports but is dwarfed by the combined market of the other 27 members of the EU, who took just over a half of exports (53.4 per cent in the first six months of 2018).The steep decline in production for UK market specifically (47.2 per cent) was said to be due to certain-one off and some short-run actors, such as manufacturers’ changeovers of model lines, and the hurried adoption of real-world fuel consumption standards, but also from a sharp reduction in UK home market demand, which was in turn driven by continuing weakness in consumer sentiment, uncertainty about the future for diesel cars and the general fog surrounding Brexit.However, given that about four out of every five cars made in Britain goes abroad to be sold, British domestic demand is relatively small contributor to overall demand. The SMMT said it was confident that UK production would end the year at about 1.6 million cars, around the same level as in 2017.Although broadly supportive of the government’s white paper, derided by some critics as “dead on arrival” in Brussels, Mr Hawes added that the FCA is just “an idea at the moment” which required “a huge amount of work and investment” even to make practical.The SMMT’s position remains, as it has since the EU referendum, that the industry requires the same degree of frictionless access to its EU markets as it enjoys today, and that anything that falls short of that will damage competitiveness and, eventually, investment and jobs.Key investment decisions by major companies such as Nissan, Honda and Tata (Jaguar Land Rover) on fresh investment on new models, engines and componentry still hang in the balance.Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union The SMMT\u0026nbspis firm that any current arrangements, governed by the EU Customs Union and Single Market, should continue until satisfactory new rules have been implemented, not merely agreed in theory or principle.If not, then the negative effects will be felt unremittingly through the 2020s, given the nature of the industry’s investment cycle, driven by relatively long model cycles.\u0026nbspThe industry also called on the government, once again, to provide more clarity about the future of diesel engines, claiming that successive government white papers had failed to do so and had left consumers postponing orders.

Even so, the company sold slightly fewer units with 41.3 sold compared to the expectation that 41.8 million would be sold.Apple’s postings showed that the average iPhone sold cost $724, far outweighing previous expectations that the average price would come in at $694, according to the data providing service FactSet. During the quarter, an Apple spokesperson told Reuters, the best selling model was the IPhone X, which retails for $999.Apple unveils the iPhone XApple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, shows Animoji during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, speaks during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, shows Animoji during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, speaks during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple, the world’s most valuable technology company, forecast revenues of between $60b and $62b for its fourth fiscal quarter, a figure that will include any advance sales of the company’s coming new models of iPhone.The earnings report is good news for the technology company, which last week avoided a tech sector sell-off that saw shareholders dropping stake in Facebook, Twitter, and Netflix amid concerns about the future growth of the companies.While Apple has a market valuation above $900b, the company could be facing rocky roads ahead if President Donald Trump imposes tariffs that impact the import of its devices into the US. Mr Trump has yet to say exactly which product categories he might target with tariffs on Chinese goods, but the taxes could potentially impact products like the Apple Watch, one of the company’s main growth drivers.\u0026nbspReuters contributed to this reportEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/30/13/Theresa-May-00.jpg  width= 2216  height= 1662  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/30/13/Theresa-May-00.jpg","title":"brexit uk car industry not ready no deal smmt mike hawes","story":"Created with Sketch.Firms\u0026nbsp‘increasingly concerned\u0027 about looming prospect of no-deal Brexit, says\u0026nbspMike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and TradersClick to followThe Independent OnlineNo UK car manufacturer ready for Brexit, industry warnsThe British motor industry has warned that “no one would confess to being Brexit ready” in their trade.\u0026nbspMike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), argues that his members are “increasingly concerned” about the prospects for the UK leaving the EU on World Trade Organisation (WTO) terms, in the light of developments since Theresa May published the government’s latest Brexit white paper, which he and the SMMT welcomed.Michel\u0026nbspBarnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has since expressed scepticism about the proposed Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA), which would have been of particular value to manufacturing and the automotive sector.In the light of EU resistance, and growing UK political volatility, the chances of the UK going to a “no deal” exit are increasing, meaning that Britain would move to WTO terms, as opposed to staying in the Single Market, the customs union or the FCA.This would imply tariffs of up to 10 per cent in UK-EU trade in cars and parts, and greater bureaucracy in both directions, which would only be partly mitigated by “stockpiling” in the short run, given the demands of “just in time” manufacturing techniques and integrated cross-border supply chains.There is a tail risk that factory production of models such as the Mini at BMW’s plant in Oxford could be disrupted if crucial car components become unavailable.\u0026nbspMr Hawes\u0026nbspadded that the prospect of a “no deal” Brexit was something no-one wished to see and that industry leaders wished to see “all options open as long as possible”.\u0026nbspReflecting on the 1,100 trucks that enter the UK from Europe every day to feed its factories, he said that the eight months remaining until formal Brexit on 29 March 2019 were “a real challenge”.\u0026nbspBritish car production for the home market almost halved in June, compared to the same month a year ago, due to what the industry calls “a perfect storm” of factors that resulted in a freakish result.Landmark EU-Japan deal puts pressure on UK over car manufacturing jobsTrump tariffs could cost Alabama car industry 20,000 jobs, warn unionsGovernment urged to stop ‘squabbling’ and save UK car industryInvestment in UK car industry halves because of BrexitOverall, UK manufacture of cars was just 3.3 per cent down in the year to the end of June 2018, buoyed by exceptionally high demand for British products in certain export destinations, notably Japan (up 77.3 per cent), Korea (up 67.8 per cent) and relatively stable demand in China, the US\u0026nbspand Europe.\u0026nbspAmerica is the biggest single national market for British automotive exports but is dwarfed by the combined market of the other 27 members of the EU, who took just over a half of exports (53.4 per cent in the first six months of 2018).The steep decline in production for UK market specifically (47.2 per cent) was said to be due to certain-one off and some short-run actors, such as manufacturers’ changeovers of model lines, and the hurried adoption of real-world fuel consumption standards, but also from a sharp reduction in UK home market demand, which was in turn driven by continuing weakness in consumer sentiment, uncertainty about the future for diesel cars and the general fog surrounding Brexit.However, given that about four out of every five cars made in Britain goes abroad to be sold, British domestic demand is relatively small contributor to overall demand.

The budget travel group’s chief executive told a press conference in Vienna that he was prepared to cut jobs “in any market” if necessary, a week after pilots employed by the firm in Dublin staged two 24-hour strikes. Nearly 100 pilots who are members of the Irish Airline Pilots’ Association (IALPA) voted to strike in a dispute about seniority, annual leave arrangements and transfers of flight crew between European and North African bases. IALPA members are planning further action for this Friday, 3 August. On Monday, Ryanair pilots in Germany voted in favour of striking, followed by pilots in the Netherlands voting in favour of industrial action on Tuesday. Ryanair cabin crews in Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain also downed tools last week, with workers seeking local contracts and better conditions. Commenting on Ryanair’s ongoing dealings with pilots and unions, Mr O’Leary said: “As long as there’s common sense on their side then we’ll reach agreements.“If we have people who just want to have strikes for the sake of having strikes then they can have strikes and they’ll find themselves (with) jobs getting moved and aircraft getting moved.”The company has previously said it plans to move crew and planes away from Dublin because of the effect industrial action has had on business. Describing Ryanair as “the ultimate opportunistic airline”, he added: “We have today - in Ryanair - 20 markets that need more aircraft. We’re short of aircraft in almost every market in which we operate because of the demand for our prices, our services.“If some market is being damaged as the Irish market has been damaged in recent months by these activities, the Polish market is growing hugely strongly for us, the Ryanair Sun is very full, profitable, we need more aircraft in the Polish market - move aircraft to Poland.”Ryanair: More than 20 flight cancellations blamed on bad weatherRyanair strike: when your boarding pass becomes a raffle ticketRyanair: pilots to strike again on first Friday in AugustMeanwhile, dozens of Ryanair flights were cancelled on Tuesday, affecting routes in and out of London Stansted, due to weather concerns and air-traffic control staff shortages around Europe. At least 7,000 passengers have been affected by the timetable disruption. The airline said: “Ryanair sincerely apologise for these weather and ATC disruptions which are entirely beyond our control.“The knock on effect of this and ATC staff shortages may cause further disruptions throughout the day, including delays and cancellations.” Additional reporting by newswiresEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/15/14/Philip-Pullman.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1899  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/15/14/Philip-Pullman.jpg","title":"damian hinds preschool children social mobility parents literacy word gap","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027This matters, because when you’re behind from the start you rarely catch up,\u0027 Damian\u0026nbspHinds will sayClick to followThe Independent OnlineChildren arriving at school unable to speak or read properly is a ‘scandal’, minister saysIt is a “scandal” that young children are\u0026nbspnot able to speak or read properly when they arrive at school, the education secretary will say in his first speech on social mobility.\u0026nbspThis matters, because when you’re behind from the start you rarely catch up,\u0026nbspDamian\u0026nbspHinds will add as he launches\u0026nbspa coalition of businesses, charities, tech and media groups\u0026nbspto encourage more parents to read and learn new words with their children.He will add: Your peers don’t wait, the gap just widens. This has a huge impact on social mobility.”The\u0026nbsplatest statistics\u0026nbspfrom the Department for Education (DfE) showed\u0026nbsp28 per cent of four and five-year-olds lacked the early communication skills – such as being able to talk about events in the past or future – expected by the end of reception year.Mr Hinds will set out his plans to halve the number of children starting school without vital literacy skills by 2028.\u0026nbspAn awareness-raising campaign – similar to the “five-a-day”\u0026nbspcampaign that encouraged more people to eat fruit and vegetables – could be introduced to change busy parents’ behaviour.Mr Hinds will say: “It is a persistent scandal that we have children starting school not able to communicate in full sentences, not able to read simple words.\u0026nbspThis matters, because when you’re behind from the start you rarely catch up. Your peers don’t wait, the gap just widens. This has a huge impact on social mobility.”Mr Hinds will highlight that the vast majority of preschool children spend most of their time at home, adding that the government cannot afford to ignore “the home learning environment”.“I don’t have any interest in lecturing parents here, he will say.\u0026nbspI know it’s parents who bring up their children, who love them, who invest in them in so many ways, who want the best for their children.\u0026nbspBut that doesn’t mean extra support and advice can’t be helpful.The coalition will hold a summit in the autumn to come up with practical ideas that boost parents’ confidence to\u0026nbspsupport\u0026nbsptheir child’s language and literacy from an early age.Children with poor vocabulary at age five are more than twice as likely to be unemployed aged 34 as children with good vocabulary.Mr Hinds will add there are “legitimate worries about screen time” but he hopes technology can be used to “build parents’ confidence” around early language development.Earlier this month, acclaimed author Philip Pullman said parents needed to get off their mobile phones and speak to young children to boost their vocabulary.Amanda Spielman, head of Ofsted, has also raised her concerns about the word gap. Following her speech to nursery leaders, early years experts suggested that the fact a lot of parents were spending time on their phones had contributed to poor language skills among young children.UK news in picturesFriends of Lucy McHugh gather in Mansel Park, Southampton to release balloons in her memory.

However it can sometimes be difficult to get them involved in their child’s learning and we know little about how to do this well.”Department for EducationEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/13/20/pp-child-poverty-2-getty.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/13/20/pp-child-poverty-2-getty.jpg","title":"school holidays hunger poverty national education union food","story":"Created with Sketch.Children\u0026nbspreturn to school \u0027looking visibly less well nourished\u0027Click to followThe Independent OnlineNearly four in five teachers say \u0027holiday hunger\u0027 is failing to improveHoliday hunger is affecting more children now than it did three years ago, nearly four in five teachers have warned.\u0026nbspThe number of teenagers going hungry during the summer holidays has failed to improve, the poll conducted\u0026nbspby the\u0026nbspNational Education Union\u0026nbsprevealed.\u0026nbspThey also said they were concerned local initiatives designed to tackle the issue, such as food banks, are not equipped to meet the demand.Of 657 secondary school teachers surveyed, nearly half confirmed children in their school had experienced holiday hunger.Seventy-seven per cent said in the last three years the situation had either worsened (51 per cent) or stayed the same (26 per cent).Fifty-nine per cent felt the combined provision of food banks, charityvolunteer organisations and faith groups was insufficient to tackle holiday hunger.\u0026nbspJust five per cent thought it would be enough.One teacher told the survey:\u0026nbsp“I see children come back to school in September looking visibly less well nourished.”A third added: “When many of our children are struggling to get enough food during term time (when over 50 per cent get at least one good meal per day as they are FSM), the problem will obviously be exacerbated during the holidays.”UK news in picturesFriends of Lucy McHugh gather in Mansel Park, Southampton to release balloons in her memory.

Food banks, faith groups and charitablevoluntary organisations are now being left to pick up the pieces where central government has failed.“Indeed, rather than fix the problem of child poverty, the government has instead attempted to redefine it. Of the services available, demand will clearly outstrip supply. It is shameful that the safety net is so threadbare.\u0026nbspThe government must take steps to tackle the issue of holiday hunger through properly funded and resourced programmes.Biggest rise in UK poverty since Thatcher was in power, experts claimUN to investigate extreme poverty in the UK – after years of austerityMore than one in 10 households living in fuel poverty, figures showLabour to stop academies paying ‘poverty wages’ while bosses get £100kGiven the scale of the problem the government’s announcement of £2m additional funds to help disadvantaged children with food and fun over the holidays, while welcome, goes nowhere near far enough to tackle the desperate plight of families and children.”It comes after a previous NEU survey found malnourished children are stuffing their pockets with food as the numbers living in poverty grows.The survey found three in five (60 per cent) of school staff believed child poverty had worsened since 2015.\u0026nbspOf those, the vast majority (87 per cent) said it was having a significant impact on the learning of their pupils.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/12/12/mark-billingham-1.jpg","title":"long reads hero sas who dares wins culture tv marvel","story":"Created with Sketch.Is he a Marvel-esque superhuman or an SAS daredevil?

Whatever the answer, it’s clear the public imagination is still holding out for a heroClick to followThe Independent OnlineMark Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathedHe was providing protection to Tom Cruise at the time. Summer of 2002, in Rome. Time off from shooting The Last Samurai. He had mapped it all out, talked it over with the paparazzi beforehand, so it was no sweat. They would pause for a minute or so in front of the Excelsior, the snappers would politely keep their distance, and then he and Cruise would sedately enter the hotel. Everyone would be happy. And the plan went completely to plan. They stopped. The paparazzi took their pictures. Box-office star plus bodyguard gracefully two-step in the direction of the hotel. No drama. Until the point where they’re about to go through the door.\u0026nbspMark “Billy” Billingham spots this blue streak coming towards them from the right out of the corner of his eye. Instinct honed by years of training, he simultaneously wraps a protective arm around Tom Cruise and grabs hold of the blue streak with the other one. And all three of them tumble into the foyer of the hotel, with Billingham wrestling both of them to the floor. Then Tom says, “Billy, you can let me up now. I want to introduce you to my girlfriend.” Penelope Cruz – Cruise’s then partner – was the blue streak.She was impatient to see Tom. Maybe she should just have warned his bodyguard before popping up unscripted.Another time he was escorting Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie down the backstairs of the Waldorf in New York. Everyone was waiting for them at the front. Billingham’s simple plan was to take them out the back down the service stairs. What could possibly go wrong? He was leading them from the front. Ready for anything. Then he tripped and fell down the stairs, knocking himself unconscious. Pitt and Jolie rushed down and held his head and nursed him till he came around. He was seeing stars in more ways than one.It probably wouldn’t happen in Mission: Impossible. In reality everything always goes wrong and you just have to adapt. Billingham has been an A-list bodyguard to Michael Caine and Russell Crowe and he hasn’t lost anyone yet. He says the main difference with\u0026nbspCrowe is that “you spend a lot of your time trying to stop him picking fights”. Now one of the stars of the rugged Channel 4 show SAS: Who Dares Wins, he is an ace sniper and served in the SAS for nearly two decades. Earned an MBE for leading a hostage-saving mission. Tracked down, acquired\u0026nbspand delivered mass killers to the War Crimes Tribunal. And is even now planning to take on human traffickers and slavers around the world. He has paid his dues. He is probably about as close as you can get to a real-life hero. One who is still breathing, that is.Billingham with Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and their children\u0026nbspin Chicago in 2007 (Rex)The “hero” is the ultimate myth, the “monomyth” as Joseph Campbell would say (in The Hero With A Thousand Faces), going all the way back to the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, through The Odyssey and The Aeneid, and all the way up to Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher. The “hero” – whether engraved in stone or encoded in digitally enhanced celluloid – never dies. Real heroes always do, ultimately, but some live long enough to tell the tale. Here we run into the major dilemma for the hero: can he be the narrator of his own story? Can he speak in the first person of his own exploits in war? And is he necessarily a “he” anyway?T.E Lawrence (aka Lawrence of Arabia) pulled it off in his autobiographical Seven Pillars of Wisdom. So too, more recently Andy McNab, also ex-SAS, in Bravo Two Zero, and Tom Marcus in Soldier Spy. But there is a grand tradition of the unsung hero. A decent working definition of the hero is: someone who says nothing (or not much) and confines himself to pure doing. He acts and then keeps his mouth shut. A hero needs a Homer. This is only partly because, more often than not, there is a legal gag on telling tales. He is subject to the Official Secrets Act or the equivalent. But he is also constrained by the code of modesty. The hero, if he says anything, is always self-deprecating. Thus Mark Billingham’s funny, oblique, mock-heroic stories above.On the other hand Billy is very good at swearing. His daughter reckons he has a touch of Tourette’s. “I’ll try not to swear too much, I really will,” he tells the audience at Prince’s Hall in Aldershot for An Evening with Mark Billingham, “but I’ll probably f***ing fail.”Rambo (in David Morrell’s First Blood, immortalised by Sylvester Stallone) set fire to an entire town because he couldn’t find the words to express his post-Vietnam sense of guilt and horror. Thus the reality of the hero is that he has to say something. Self-repression leads straight into PTSD. Hero turns anti-hero. Billingham was inspired to join up by tales of veterans returning from the Falklands. Now 53, then a teenage rebel, troublemaker\u0026nbspand discontent. Brought up on a council estate in the Midlands, he became an artful dodger, going about stealing hats from old guys, until one old guy ran after him, caught him, and persuaded him to go to his gym and learn to box.\u0026nbspHe thought of joining the Marines, but ultimately signed up with the Parachute regiment because “they sounded wilder”. He’d never been out of Walsall and suddenly he found himself jumping out of planes in places he’d hadn’t even heard of. Billingham is above all a survivor. He says it’s “90 per cent luck and 10 per cent\u0026nbspskill – or maybe it’s 100 per cent\u0026nbspluck, I don’t know”. Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathed. “I can survive in bad places,” as he puts it. The most time he has spent in hospital has been with a dose of cerebral malaria.\u0026nbspThe true hero is vulnerable, mortal. Not a Marvel superhero. The army prizes the hard man. Maybe we all do. Which is why we sign up for SAS: Who Dares Wins or the adjacent “Break-Point Prime Evolution” regime, devised by Ollie Ollerton. We want the abs bordering on armour plating, like a shield or suit of armour. So the bullets will just bounce off. Unbreakable. That is the myth, at any rate. But Billingham tells a story of one of his comrades in Belize, a man who was famously “hard as nails”. The toughest guy in the whole regiment. He marches off into the jungle one day and not long after they hear him screaming. A group of men, led by Billingham, go trooping off after him, assuming he has been taken captive, and is almost certainly being tortured. They locate him quickly enough. No sign of the enemy. But the guy has a thorn in his ear and it’s killing him. Sometimes the worst thing about being a hero is you get dirty and sweaty and you can’t get a shower.25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonBut the big news about SAS: Who Dares Wins is that the fourth series, now in preparation, will have women recruits as well as men. No reason why they can’t jump out of helicopters or rappel down a mountain. You don’t necessarily have to look like Bruce Willis or Arnie Schwarzenegger.\u0026nbsp“Hero” is now both masculine and feminine. You can’t plausibly say “heroine” any more. It sounds too much like a weepy sentimental movie or a damsel in distress.Women fight in the front line. The Kurdish Peshmerga (which translates as “those who face death”) includes a lot of women fighters. Asia Ramazan Antar was one of the fallen in the fight against Isis so too was Anna Campbell, from Lewes. On the more mythic side, we have Wonder Woman and X-(Wo)Men. This is the age of the rogue female.\u0026nbspI spoke recently to Ruth Shackleton: distant relative of the Antarctic explorer, she spent 20 years in the RAF, rose to squadron leader, did tours of duty in all the usual hellholes, and orchestrated the Red Arrows. She totally denies ever being a hero. She reckons her most heroic moment was when, with Scud rockets from Baghdad raining down, she helped a comrade (who had temporarily lost it) put on her chemical protection suit. Which demonstrates grace under pressure.Do heroes need to be less modest? The ancient myth of the hero was largely to do with defining and asserting masculinity. Aeneas dumps Dido. Theseus uses Ariadne and her thread to negotiate the labyrinth – where he slays the Minotaur – and then sails away. Ian Fleming’s James Bond follows the same pattern. The contemporary woman hero is fighting back, mainly against patriarchy. “This is the thing about bad guys,” says Stephanie Broadribb, author of Deep Down Dead (shortlisted for the International Thriller Writers’ Best First Novel award at ThrillerFest in New York, the winner of which is announced today). “They are generally guys.” She is a skilled horsewoman who trained as a bounty hunter to provide authenticity for her ass-kicking protagonist. And wields a mean taser. “I knew when I created Lori Anderson, a woman action hero, that she would never have to be rescued by a man.” She was influenced by Thelma and Louise, re-runs of The Saint, but above all by The Avengers (the TV series) in which Emma Peel is on a par with Steed when it comes to karate.There are other variations on the hero archetype, Carrie Gracie of the BBC for one, or the suffragettes or Stella Rimington, ex-head of MI5. I would propose Sofia Helin, who plays Saga Noren in The Bridge, but is also one of the extremely modest leaders of the Swedish #MeToo movement (“SilenceAction”). But it still comes down to being able to outfight, outwit, or outgeneral the opposition. And being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Billingham sees no reason why women can’t get into the SAS itself: “If you can pass the test, you’re in.”I was brought up on a diet of highly heroic post-Second World War comics, like Valiant and Victor (who could forget Captain Hurricane?) But at a certain point I decided the hero was uncool. Was he not, after all, a flag-waver for the military industrial complex? Verging on imperialist? Behind every Aeneas there is an Augustus or a Caesar. Winston Churchill is liable to be co-opted by every tub-thumping would-be dictator (as per Boris Johnson with his sub-Kipling rhetoric of “sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering”.) The hero, like Napoleon, can become a tyrant. And yet the hero deserves resurrection.Why Now That’s What I Call Music still has a place in pop culture‘Spiderman’ who scaled flats to save child begins job as firefighterHumiliation: The pain of character assassination in the public eyeAt one level, maybe nobody is a hero (who can coincide with a myth?). At another, maybe everyone is, or would like to be (sometimes just getting out of bed in the morning is an act of heroism). Perhaps Gareth Southgate and the England football team all are. Anyone on a quest or a mission. Most of my personal heroes are surfers (take a bow, Ted Deerhurst). We haven’t yet given up on knight errants, Shane-style lonesome cowboys, and Liam Neeson. Lee Child, creator of the globally bestselling Jack Reacher series, says of vigilante loner heroes – who, like the ronin, are wandering samurai that have no lord or master and don’t belong to any conventional force – that “we invented them tens of thousands of years ago because we desperately wanted them to exist.\u0026nbspWe continue to reinvent them in flimsily disguised forms because we need them to be there, as a matter of catharsis and consolation.”Paul Hughes reckons we need them more than ever. He is a multilingual ex-RAF intelligence officer turned forensic scientist (and CEO of PH Interim) who goes about the country inspiring young people in schools with his non-fictional tales of bravery – not least in dealing with challenges they might face at school. Hughes says that “if you ask anyone who their hero is these days, they are more likely to answer Ed Sheeran or one of those characters from Love Island”. He argues that we are apt to think, just because we are sitting on a sofa and watching television, that the world is a safe place. It isn’t. “Today’s teenagers were born after 911. They haven’t seen Srebrenica or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. People forget so quickly – they need to be reminded.”I’ve often said (mostly to others, sometimes to myself), “Don’t be a hero!” Which is fair enough, mostly. Avoid pointless heroics, if possible. Jaw-jaw not war-war. But the hero, of whichever gender, Billingham or Bond, Thelma or Louise, remains rooted in the collective unconscious. Maybe it’s just as well. So long as we have enemies, we will still need heroes.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’\u0026nbspand teaches at the University of Cambridge.

They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fundraising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2014/04/11/16/world-in-pic-5.jpg","title":"theme parks children office slides rollercoaster pub adrenaline fun","story":"Created with Sketch.When most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health,\u0026nbspthere is nothing more precious than a place intended simply for funClick to followThe Independent OnlineRollercoasters invoke \u0027eustress\u0027, a kind of stress that is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it outThat moment at the top of a rollercoaster – after the slow upwards build, when you’re high above the treeline, dangling, stomach clenched, looking down – is hard to compare to anything else.

You can bet that any resort you visit will be filled with varied and never ending things to discover.Whether it’s the thrill-inducing rides, the milder water rides, the inventive “worlds” or the over-priced but delicious doughnut and ice-cream combos that draw you in, it’s hard to deny that theme parks offer something for everyone. They are often marketed as family attractions, something for the kids, but they are places that can captivate and entertain at any age.I don’t feel like I enjoy theme parks any less now that I’m an (admittedly childish) adult – if anything, I enjoy them more. My mood is not as volatile (kids have the tendency to be excited one moment and in a strop the next), I don’t tire at the end of the day and I can appreciate things I didn’t as a kid – the engineering that’s gone into creating a place (not that I know anything about engineering), the small details, the truly fine art and craftsmanship.And as far as I’m concerned theme parks are a work of art. As Bill Watterson, creator of the cartoon strip Calvin and Hobbes, believed, I couldn’t agree more that there is no such thing as high art and low art – rather creations that either speak to people or don’t. And what could speak to people more than a place created for the sole purpose of having fun?Kingda\u0026nbspKa, New Jersey, is the world’s tallest rollercoaster at 456ft – higher than Big BenAfter all, when most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health, there is nothing more precious than escapism. Our cities, towns and villages revolve around practicality – offices for working in, shops for buying things, gyms for exercising. Most of what surrounds us is mundane – it’s pretty wonderful in this context that we have places created for the sole purpose of having fun.But while some of the elements of enjoyment are\u0026nbspeasy to recognise as such – good food, fun family rides and the opportunity to take a picture with a lifesize Donald Duck – what is it that is so enticing about rollercoasters? By definition they should evoke sheer terror, yet we absolutely adore them\u0026nbspand queue for hours on end for the two-minute scare they provide.Richard Stephens, a senior lecturer in psychology at Keele University, argues that rollercoasters invoke a good kind of stress, called “eustress” – a word that has the same route as “euphoria”. This kind of stress is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it out.Eustress can also explain why we like being scared in other contexts, such as on ghost trains or in live action horror mazes. It makes sense that we must all have different ways of seeking this kind of good stress – which is why some people love rollercoasters and some people can’t stand them. I’m a big fan of rollercoasters but the thought of scuba ing absolutely terrifies me. But for others I imagine this is a “eustressful” experience.For the ultimate thrillseeker, the fastest rollercoaster in the world is currently the Formula Rossa at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, which reaches an eye-watering 150mph. The second fastest, Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, is also the world’s tallest,\u0026nbspat 456ft. To put that into some perspective, Big Ben in London stands shorter at 320ft.But Kingda Ka will not hold its title for long, as a new coaster, Skyscraper, is set to open in Florida in 2020 and will reach 500ft, plus have the steepest drop of any rollercoaster in the world.And lastly the longest rollercoaster, the Steel Dragon 2000, at Nagashima Spa Land in Japan is a whopping 8,133ft. It is the only existing rollercoaster to break the 8,000ft threshold, and it lasts for a whole four minutes.With rides becoming increasingly complex and impressive, it’s fascinating to see where things all started. The first commercial rollercoaster in the world, Switchback Railway, opened in 1884 in Coney Island, New York. It kickstarted the growth of attractions in the US, and before long Coney Island housed a few similar rides. The oldest acknowledged theme park was also located in the US:\u0026nbspSanta Claus Land opened in Indiana in 1935, and included many rides themed around the big\u0026nbspman in red.If you’d like a taste of an ancient theme park,\u0026nbspthe oldest\u0026nbspstill in operation can be found in Klampenborg, Denmark. Bakken opened in 1583 and has more than 150 attractions, including a wooden rollercoaster built in 1932. Denmark is also the home of Lego, and the original Legoland Park – so a heaven for theme park fans.In the UK we’ve also been breathing life into old theme parks, such as\u0026nbspDreamland\u0026nbspin Margate. First opened in 1880 and popular all the way through to the\u0026nbsp1990s, it was closed in 2003 and set to become a residential area. But after local residents campaigned to restore and open Dreamland instead, it was brought back and soon had a £25m\u0026nbsprevamp.It now has a concert venue, seaside pub and rooftop rum shack, and new rides are being introduced to sit alongside the restored vintage ones. According to its Wikipedia page, it’s intended to be a “working museum of vintage funfair rides”. And it’s changing the fortunes of the surrounding small seaside town in Kent.Another intriguing destination is an unexpected one. Nestled deep in the Italian woods, Ai Pioppi boasts a colourful range of rides – none of which are powered by electricity. Instead, riders push, pedal and swing – but we’re not talking playground-style attractions here\u0026nbspwe’re talking full-on Ferris wheels and rollercoasters. But perhaps even more impressive than the park’s eco-credentials is its founder, Bruno Ferrin, who has been building the park himself since the late 1960s. He started by adding a few slides to accompany his restaurant – and it grew from there.Around the world there are a whole host of niche theme parks – those interested can visit Hello Kitty’s castle in Japan, unearth mud at Diggerland\u0026nbspin various locations across the UK and US and view a host of farting and vomiting statues\u0026nbspat BonBon-Land in Zealand, Denmark.Of course, obscurities aside, you’re still guaranteed to have fun at your local attraction. And increasingly we’re seeing theme park culture enter\u0026nbspour day-to-day – less traditional workplaces are starting to install slides and ball pits and Penn State station in New York is considering adding a rollercoaster alongside it’s shops and subway platforms.It would do us all some good to get out the office and have some fun for the sake of fun –\u0026nbspor even better\u0026nbspwe could incorporate theme park rides and attractions into our daily lives.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The budget travel group’s chief executive told a press conference in Vienna that he was prepared to cut jobs “in any market” if necessary, a week after pilots employed by the firm in Dublin staged two 24-hour strikes. Nearly 100 pilots who are members of the Irish Airline Pilots’ Association (IALPA) voted to strike in a dispute about seniority, annual leave arrangements and transfers of flight crew between European and North African bases. IALPA members are planning further action for this Friday, 3 August. On Monday, Ryanair pilots in Germany voted in favour of striking, followed by pilots in the Netherlands voting in favour of industrial action on Tuesday. Ryanair cabin crews in Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain also downed tools last week, with workers seeking local contracts and better conditions. Commenting on Ryanair’s ongoing dealings with pilots and unions, Mr O’Leary said: “As long as there’s common sense on their side then we’ll reach agreements.“If we have people who just want to have strikes for the sake of having strikes then they can have strikes and they’ll find themselves (with) jobs getting moved and aircraft getting moved.”The company has previously said it plans to move crew and planes away from Dublin because of the effect industrial action has had on business. Describing Ryanair as “the ultimate opportunistic airline”, he added: “We have today - in Ryanair - 20 markets that need more aircraft. We’re short of aircraft in almost every market in which we operate because of the demand for our prices, our services.“If some market is being damaged as the Irish market has been damaged in recent months by these activities, the Polish market is growing hugely strongly for us, the Ryanair Sun is very full, profitable, we need more aircraft in the Polish market - move aircraft to Poland.”Ryanair: More than 20 flight cancellations blamed on bad weatherRyanair strike: when your boarding pass becomes a raffle ticketRyanair: pilots to strike again on first Friday in AugustMeanwhile, dozens of Ryanair flights were cancelled on Tuesday, affecting routes in and out of London Stansted, due to weather concerns and air-traffic control staff shortages around Europe. At least 7,000 passengers have been affected by the timetable disruption. The airline said: “Ryanair sincerely apologise for these weather and ATC disruptions which are entirely beyond our control.“The knock on effect of this and ATC staff shortages may cause further disruptions throughout the day, including delays and cancellations.” Additional reporting by newswiresEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/02/13/khufus-pyramid.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/02/13/khufus-pyramid.jpg","title":"great pyramid giza egypt electromagnetic energy radio chambers itmo university","story":"Created with Sketch.Revelation could have\u0026nbsptechnological applications such as creating effective solar cells, say researchersClick to followThe Independent OnlineGreat Pyramid of Giza may be able to focus electromagnetic energy through its hidden chambers, physicists revealThe Great Pyramid of Giza may be able to focus electromagnetic radiation into pockets of energy inside its network of internal chambers and underneath its base, a new study has suggested.Theoretical research by a team of Russian scientists aimed to understand how the pyramid would respond to radio waves directed at it, with the goal of recreating its shape at a nanoscale.But far from unveiling and harnessing some mystical property of the ancient structure, the scientists hope to use their findings in technological applications such as creating effective solar cells.Speculation about the supposed function of Egypt’s pyramids has been prevalent since at least the early 20th century, and the structures have been linked with everything from aliens to the apocalypse.As the oldest and largest of the Giza pyramids, the Great Pyramid constructed for Pharaoh Khufu thousands of years ago has\u0026nbspdrawn some of the wildest theories.In their paper, the scientists acknowledge that “these amazing structures excite the imagination of people engendering various fables and baseless assumptions”.This, they explain, is what makes it all the more important for scientists to use modern techniques to explore the real-life mysteries of the pyramids.They used mathematical models to understand how light would react with a hypothetical nanoparticle shaped like the ancient wonder of the world.“Egyptian pyramids have always attracted great attention,” said Dr Andrey Evlyukhin from ITMO University, one of the study’s authors.“We as scientists were interested in them as well, so we decided to look at the Great Pyramid as a particle dissipating radio waves resonantly.”\u0026nbspTheir research has been\u0026nbsppublished in the Journal of Applied Physics.Tombs of the pyramid builders discovered in Giza, EgyptImages courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)Images courtesy the SCA (Supreme Council of Antiquities)The scientists\u0026nbspfirst estimated that a so-called “resonant” state could be achieved in the pyramid using radio wave lengths ranging from 200m to 600m, meaning electromagnetic energy would be concentrated within and underneath the structure.“Due to the lack of information about the physical properties of the pyramid, we had to use some assumptions,” said Dr Evlyukhin.“For example, we assumed that there are no unknown cavities inside, and the building material with the properties of an ordinary limestone is evenly distributed in and out of the pyramid. With these assumptions made, we obtained interesting results that can find important practical applications.”The team’s interest in the Great Pyramid was first roused while they were investigating the interaction between light and certain nanoparticles.Light can be controlled at a nanoscale by varying the size, shape and refractive index of the nanoparticles’ source materials.The Pyramids of Giza are near a Pizza Hut and more disappointmentsArchaeologists find 4,400-year-old tomb near pyramids outside CairoNow, the scientists want to find out if by creating nanoparticles shaped like the Great Pyramid, they can get them to interact with light in the same way it interacted with radio waves – concentrating its energy into specific areas.“Choosing a material with suitable electromagnetic properties, we can obtain pyramidal nanoparticles with a promise for practical application in nanosensors and effective solar cells,” said Dr Polina Kapitanova, another ITMO University physicist.This is not the first time the worlds of physics and pyramid research have collided.\u0026nbspIn a 2017 paper published in the journal Nature, scientists used particle physics techniques to discover a new chamber inside the Great Pyramid – the first to be revealed since the 19th century.\u0026nbspGreat Pyramid of GizaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/13/17/rtx9a5l.jpg  width= 2072  height= 1462  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/13/17/rtx9a5l.jpg","title":"skype wedding bride groom alexander and dyne biancardi uk france visa home office","story":"Created with Sketch.Exclusive: Guests have flown in from around the world for £20,000 ceremony where bride is likely to be missing after visa refusedClick to followThe Independent OnlineAlexander and Dyne Biancardi applied for her visa five months ago and now face being apart for their big dayA couple fear they will be forced to hold\u0026nbsptheir £20,000\u0026nbspwedding ceremony in separate countries after the bride was refused a visa to enter the UK and the Home Office\u0026nbspmissed the deadline to notify them.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAlexander and Dyne\u0026nbspBiancardi\u0026nbspface having to marry 210 miles apart – he in England and she in\u0026nbspFrance\u0026nbsp– holding up iPads and using\u0026nbspSkype.\u0026nbspThe couple are expecting 90 guests at a lavish ceremony in Surrey this Sunday that has cost £20,000.

The border guards kept saying ‘how do we know you’re not lying?’“They then said the visa had been denied in May, which we didn’t know. It seemed there was nothing I could say to convince them even though we had a letter from my father-in-law confirming we wouldn’t be claiming welfare.”Mr\u0026nbspBiancardi, an adjunct professor of political science in California, added: The\u0026nbspBorder Force\u0026nbspofficers said they had concerns and made us wait 45 minutes. They then put my wife through a torturous process, taking her into an office on her own, while I had to wait outside for two hours.”His mother had put in an “insane” amount of work into the wedding preparations, including a cake, £11,000 of catering, a photographer and booking the venue, amounting to £20,000, he said.\u0026nbspThe family would not have spent that had the Home Office informed them of the visa refusal decision, he\u0026nbspadded.\u0026nbspThe 90 guests include 15 friends who have flown over from California for the event.US-trained Mrs Biancardi has already sat a law conversion exam, allowing her to practise in Britain\u0026nbspand her husband is due to begin a master’s degree in sociology at Bristol in September. Now they believe their plans might have to be overturned.“We’re desperate to have the wedding but my biggest priority is not to disappoint my family so I’m thinking of still going there for it, she said.\u0026nbsp“We’ve been feeling incredibly depressed.\u0026nbspHer fiance added\u0026nbspthat if there\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspstill no way of her\u0026nbspentering Britain before Sunday’s ceremony, one option is for his father to hold up an iPad with a Skype link on it to France while the groom walks down the aisle.“When we found out the spouse’s visa had been rejected it only left a few days to apply for a visitor’s visa but what are the chances of getting that in time? We feel this has been very unjust,” he said.The Independent has asked the Home Office for a comment but it had not replied at the time of publication.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/23/18/BREXIT-VOTE-MARCH-29.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6341451  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/23/18/BREXIT-VOTE-MARCH-29.jpg","title":"brexit key dates when uk leave eu transition period theresa may","story":"Created with Sketch.All the main events ahead of Brexit Day on 29 March 2019Click to followIndy PoliticsBrexit key dates: When is the UK leaving the EU?As Britain prepares to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, much uncertainty hangs in the air.

There have been pilots elsewhere. I’m trying to wait for the feedback.”Last year, Mr McDonnell had told The Independent that Labour had set up a working group to investigate the feasibility of a basic income – led by one of his economic advisers, Guy Standing. During the height of the attempted coup against Mr Corbyn in 2016, the shadow chancellor also suggested he could “win the argument” on the idea within the Labour Party.In the\u0026nbspinterview with The Independent, Mr McDonnell continued: “If you look at what’s happened elsewhere in other countries – and I think Scotland is looking at it as well – they are doing it on a small geographical basis in particular towns. Guy is looking at that now and coming forward with proposals.“It will be thrown into the discussions about the next manifesto – that’s one of the ideas that a lot of people are pressing for.”While the finer details of such a pilot are expected to be set out at a later date, a year long scheme involving 2,000 participants was launched in Finland in 2017 with each inidual receiving a €560 (£490) monthly basic payment, equivalent to £5,880 a year.A poll last year by the Institute for Policy Research at the University of Bath suggested that nearly half of all Britons (49 per cent) would back such a scheme and proponents include the prominent billionaires Mark Zuckerberg and Richard Branson.UK news in picturesFriends of Lucy McHugh gather in Mansel Park, Southampton to release balloons in her memory.

I thought we had got to a position where we are able to move on – we’re not – we’ve got to resolve that by September.“The discussion is taking place I think that will enable that to happen.”\u0026nbspPressed for his thoughts on a demonstration earlier this year in Parliament Square, in which hundreds of Jewish people gathered to demand the Labour leader tackle antisemitism in the party, Mr McDonnell said it was “deeply, deeply upsetting”.“I can’t tell you how upsetting it was,” he added. “It really cut you to the core, it really did. You have work these things through.”He continued: “The issue for me is that it’s upsetting but partly because you think how have we got ourselves in this situation, we’ve got to get this sorted it out but also in the life experiences of members of the Jewish community, while we have these disputes going on in the media and elsewhere, there isn’t sufficient campaigning on the ground to tackle those.“You just want to get on with the job of tackling antisemitism – what we should be doing now and I hope we can do is working in inidual communities identifying where the peaks are in terms of the antisemitic incidents, working with the community about how we tackle those that includes working with the police.”On Brexit, he added that there will “almost certainly” be a debate on Brexit at Labour’s annual conference in Liverpool this September after the issue had been raised at union conferences and Constituency Labour Party meetings across the country.“There will be a range of policy debates and Brexit is bound to be one of them,” he said. “There’s bound to be debate this year.When pressed on the prospect of a fresh public vote on the final Brexit deal – something Labour has consistently refused to rule out – Mr McDonnell said that while the party is “always up for some form of democratic engagement” his preference would be for a general election.“My view is that they should just move over and let us start the negotiations. If they are not willing to do that – general election and let’s decide.”On Labour’s failure to explicitly rule out a fresh referendum, he explained: “Why not? It’s not our policy, it’s not our policy and the worry I have, if you look at the opinion polls, split down the middle still – absolutely split. There’s been movement either way. My worry is that if you go for another referendum we could have an equally spilt vote and ide the country all over again.”Mr McDonnell added that his greatest fear with a second vote would be the “rise of the xenophobic right”, adding: “We’ve already seen that on the Tommy Robinson marches, which has been on a scale that has shocked people and certainly surprised people.“I think there’s a real problem,” he said. “It could be really dangerous if you split the country again and allow that xenophobic right to exploit the issue again. That’s why I’d rather we had a general election and again – as I say – in a general election you’re debating all the issues but you’re also choosing the team who will then go and negotiate.”In the coming months Mr McDonnell said he will be doing what has been promised as an anti-austerity tour of the country in areas he believes the party should have won at the previous election and regions where the party could win next time round. And as part of the Labour’s preparations for the ultimate goal of holding office, he said a Queen’s Speech, linked to a first Budget, was also being planned.But when asked whether he thought the public viewed him as Chancellor-in-waiting, he replied: “You know, I don’t think the public know who I am. We’ve done some polling, as you do, and drilled down into the polling about who knows who. Philip Hammond and myself are hardly recognised – we’re on the same par.“For me, I’m not bothered about personal recognition, it’s whether they understand our policies.“I’m not bothered whether the general public recognise me – we’re not into personality politics. It’s the Tony Benn thing: policies rather personalities. What I am more interested in is making sure people understand our policies, support them, and also we can convince them we have the capability to deliver. In some ways that means being seen as a team overall.He said it’s “not about do I get recognised in the street”, but added: “I do a lot. What’s interesting is that people sit on the Tube opposite, looking at me thinking I know him from somewhere and thinking am I a family member – and it’s really funny.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/29/13/rtx1mkc4.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1607  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/29/13/rtx1mkc4.jpg","title":"no deal brexit jeremy hunt france germany theresa may leave eu emmanuel macron angela merkel","story":"Created with Sketch.Appeal comes as Emmanuel Macron invites the prime minister to\u0026nbspurgent talks at his holiday retreatClick to followIndy PoliticsJeremy Hunt calls on France and Germany to stop no-deal Brexit, insisting Theresa May will not \u0027blink\u0027Jeremy Hunt has called on France and Germany to intervene to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU with no deal, insisting Theresa May will not “blink”.The foreign secretary appealed to the EU’s most powerful countries to force Brussels to offer the UK better terms, as he warned the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit is “increasing by the day”.It came as Emmanuel Macron, the French president, invited Ms May to break off her holiday for urgent talks at his retreat in the south of France on Friday.Michel Barnier, the EU’s negotiator, and some senior EU politicians\u0026nbsphave ridiculed the notion of Berlin and Paris stepping in to end the deadlock and arrange a more favourable deal for the UK.But Mr Hunt said: “There is real chance of no deal by accident. Everyone is assuming, no, no, no, this will never happen. Well, actually, it could.“France and Germany have to send a strong signal to the commission that we need to negotiate a pragmatic and sensible outcome that protects jobs on both sides of the Channel, because for every job lost in the UK, there will be jobs lost in Europe as well if Brexit goes wrong.”In an article for the London Evening Standard, Mr Hunt wrote: “The probability of no deal is increasing by the day until we see a change of approach from the European Commission who have this view that they just need to wait and Britain will blink. That is just a profound misunderstanding of us as a nation.”Despite backing Remain – and once calling for a fresh referendum on the Brexit deal – he also insisted the UK would “thrive”, even with the massive disruption of no deal.People\u0027s Vote march - demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march“I’ve always been someone who believed that, if we ended up with no deal, we would find a way to thrive economically because we are Britain, we are that sort of country. We have solved these kinds of problems,” the foreign secretary wrote.That verdict is strongly contradicted by the government’s own leaked Brexit impact assessment, which warned of an 8 per cent hit to national output without a trade agreement.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also warned the UK economy would suffer more than the EU’s – losing 4 per cent of GDP, compared with 1.5 per cent across the channel.And ministers have been forced to concede there are emergency plans to ensure food, medicines and blood would still be available after exit day next March.Mr Hunt’s appeal comes after Mr Barnier last week\u0026nbsprejected the UK’s proposals for customs after Brexit, appearing to kill off the prime minister’s Chequers plan.No UK car manufacturer ready for Brexit, industry warnsImmigration fears will be ‘exploited’ again in Brexit run-up, MPs fearBrexit is bad for your health UK doctors warn as BMA backs Final SayMay denies army to deliver food and medicines after no-deal BrexitThe chief negotiator also urged the UK not to go behind his back, saying: “Anyone who wants to find a sliver of difference between my mandate and what the heads of government say they want are wasting their time, quite frankly.”No 10 confirmed the prime minister would fly to the south of France on Friday, cutting short her holiday in Switzerland and Italy by one day.In his article, Mr Hunt claimed there was a new unity in the cabinet after he replaced Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab replaced David Davis as Brexit secretary.“We have a united cabinet position, we are absolutely clear what we want, we know it’s not just the right thing for Britain, but it’s the right thing for Europe as well,” he said.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/30/11/India-assam-0.jpg","title":"india assam register citizens bangladesh voting rolls","story":"Created with Sketch.Government claims that hundreds of thousands of people illegally entered country from neighbouring Bangladesh since 1971Click to followThe Independent OnlineResidents queue to check their names on the final list of the National Register of Citizens India has effectively stripped 4\u0026nbspmillion people from the state of Assam of their citizenship.\u0026nbspThe state has a National Register of Citizens (NRC), which includes the names of all those who can prove they came to the state before 24 March 1971 – the day before Bangladesh declared independence.\u0026nbspIndia has now released a final draft of a list of its citizens, leaving some 4\u0026nbspmillion people to prove their Indian nationality.Force India in administration but to see out rest of the F1 seasonMan accused of cow smuggling beaten to death by mob in IndiaIndia on brink of biggest gay rights victory since independence India tourism ministry launches campaign to highlight safety of women It says hundreds of thousands of people have illegally entered the country from neighbouring Bangladesh over decades and settled down in the northeast – a claim which Bangladesh rejects.\u0026nbspThe application process for inclusion in India’s national register started in 2015.

In Balochisan, BAP won 13 seats out of the 65 while Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) was in second place with nine. Who will eventually form the government in Balochistan is unclear as the BNP, BNP-Awami, Hazara Democratic Party (HDP) have won six, three and two seats respectively, while PTI has won four.In Punjab, Pakistan\u0027s largest province, the Muslim Leaque took 129 out of 295 seats with the PTI close behind with 123, while 28 independent assembly members will play a potentially vital role in forming the government.\u0026nbspWe will definitely form our government in Punjab as we are in contact with 21 independent candidates, PTI spokesman Fawad Chaudhary saidThe poll has been marred by long delays in counting and complaints of rigging by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party.The party’s spokesman, Muhammad Mehndi, told The Independent\u0026nbspthe majority” of the elected members were “in favour of boycotting the oath of the assembly” and backed agitating against the election. There is no other opinion except that election is rigged,\u0026nbsphe said.Some of the smaller religious parties are threatening street protests if the poll is not re-run.We have decided to organise a movement to press for fresh elections, as the \u0027manipulated\u0027 results are not acceptable to us, MMA president Fazlur Rehman said.PML-N leader Shehbaz Sharif said on Saturday that he was outraged by the killing of a party member in the northern city of Mansehra and that demanding a recount was a party\u0027s legal right. He did not specify when the party member was killed.PML-N is a peaceful national political party and fear \u0026amp intimidation can\u0027t suppress our rights, Mr Sharif tweeted.Mr Khan has offered to investigate any claims of irregularities in the wake of Wednesday\u0027s poll, which Mr Sharif\u0027s PML-N and several other parties allege was skewed in favour of the former cricket hero by Pakistan\u0027s powerful military.European Union observers were critical of the political climate in the run up to the vote, saying that some parties had been disadvantaged. In their preliminary findings, the observers said the electoral process was not as good as the 2013 election and campaign week featured a lack of equality that meant it was not a level playing field for all parties.\u0026nbspThe US voiced similar concerns.We have concluded there was a lack of equality of opportunity, German MEP Michael Gahler said.A number of violent attacks, targeting political parties, party leaders, candidates and election officials, affected the campaign environment.“Most interlocutors acknowledged a systematic effort to undermine the former ruling party through cases of corruption, contempt of court and terrorist charges against its leaders and candidates.”Mr Khan\u0027s 116 seats put\u0026nbsphim short of the 137 required for an assembly majority, meaning he is likely to need a coalition with religious parties and independents to form a government.Two newly formed small parties are seen as being open to an alliance with Mr Khan\u0027s PTI.The GDA, a new alliance in Sindh province, has two seats.BAP, another new group formed by a number of seasoned political names from the southwesterly Baluchistan province, picked up four seats.The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Saturday released results for 270 seats, with elections in two seats postponed. Several were being recounted.The coalition arithmetic is slightly complicated by the fact that a further 70 seats, most reserved for women and members of non-Muslim minorities, are allocated to parties on the basis of their performance in the contested constituencies. Once those seats are added in, any coalition will need at least 172 seats.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/183x122/996253_1.jpg","title":"Brexit news Japan UK trade deal EU liam fox theresa may","story":"But Japanese minister Toshimitsu Motegi said Tokyo would spare no efforts to support the UK in joining CPTPP in a meeting with Dr Fox on his trip to Japan.Mr Motegi said: I\u0027d like to welcome your country\u0027s expression of interest in acceding to TPP11.Your expression of interest is indeed a great encouragement to our efforts to attach importance to the free-trade system based on rules, and to fight against protectionism.Japan will not spare any effort to support the UK, including providing relevant information, and acting as an intermediary to you in relation to other TPP member countries.

She is the same age as me. But that’s where the similarities stop. In fact physically, the only thing that is similar about our ­bodies are our toenails.But when I see pictures of her I don’t feel bad about myself or envious (on the contrary, I feel only admiration) because I know I have not put in any effort to look like that.I like cake too much, and I like going out with friends, having a drink, cooking and eating. And I am more than happy with my lot.The problem is, though, that a lot of women DO feel bad about themselves when they look at photos of beautiful women.They compare themselves and feel they don’t measure up that they are lacking or worthless. This is especially an issue for young girls.Talking about body image this week, Loose Women presenter Nadia Sawalha said she blames herself for her teenage daughter’s body issues.She thinks 15-year-old Maddie has developed insecurities by growing up with Nadia talking about her own.“She grew up around me being negative about my body and she picked that up by osmosis,” she said.Unfortunately, it’s true that girls are influenced by the way their mothers feel about their bodies.But the reality is it’s not just our mum’s body image that is informing ours.It’s the airbrushed adverts and the photos that have been photoshopped into flawlessness on social media, offering impossible standards for us to try to live up to.It’s the enhanced physiques of the Kardashians and the women on Love Island setting impossible standards of “femininity”.The bottom line is that women are constantly sexualised and judged on their appearance, so it’s all too easy for women to fall prey to the pursuit of a “perfection” that doesn’t exist.When “perfect” can only be attained with surgery and extreme dieting, or starvation, you are setting yourself up to feel inadequate and bad about yourself.Even when some women look like they’ve achieved “perfection”, they still feel bad about themselves.Megan on Love Island is a good example.She is absolutely stunning but still lacks confidence — the one key thing surgery and dieting can’t necessarily give you.The most important thing you can give to any young girl — or boy — is that belief in yourself and who you are, and the certainty that your personality is just as important as the way you look.The question is, how do you achieve this?One thing I always tried to emphasise to my daughter when she was young was that it’s not just your skin that people are going to judge you on.I never worried about my weight and never said I felt fat — even if I had put on a few pounds.I also emphasised that happiness is not about looks.It is about how you feel, and about the friendship, fun and laughter you have in life.Laughter and personality are infectious.People don’t want to spend time with people obsessed about their looks and their weight.They want to be around people who are interesting, fun and dynamic.Have you seen that film, I Feel Pretty? It stars Amy Schumer, whose character is fuller figured, wears big pants and is always on a diet.Then she bangs her head and wakes up thinking — and acting as if — she is drop-dead gorgeous.As a result, doors start opening for her and she can have any man she wants.It’s just a film, but it rings true: Confidence comes from within.So much about confidence comes down to attitude.If you are constantly thinking about your flaws you forget your positives.So next time you find yourself pointing out your flabby bits, force yourself to find a positive.Forget “perfect”, accept your flaws and focus instead on dressing for your body shape.If you don’t know how to, then ask a sales assistant — that is the beauty of going into a shop rather than shopping online.And there’s nothing wrong with a few props. I’m not a fan of cosmetic surgery but if a padded bra and fake tan make you feel better about yourself, then go for it.That way you’ll have more time to get on and enjoy life, rather than fretting that you don’t look like J-Lo.THE saga of Tini Owens, 68, who has been trying for several years to end her 40-year marriage to 80-year-old mushroom farmer Hugh, took a depressing turn when she lost her long-running legal battle to divorce her husband.In short, she insists their relationship has broken down but Mr Owens refuses to agree to the split.Despite her certainty that it’s over, and the fact they are now living in separate houses, five Supreme Court judges waved away Mrs Owens’ pleas to let her end the union.They ruled she must stay married – because Mrs Owens has failed to establish that her marriage had irretrievably broken down, as required by law.How farcical.We do not live in the Middle East, or the middle ages, and we are not owned by our husbands.So why is she being forced to stay married to him?And what kind of man wants to force his wife to stay married to him?They didn’t deny the conclusions drawn by people at the time that they would rectify the shocking pay-gap between the actors and give Claire a £100k cheque as back-pay.But now that the dust has settled, guess what? It turns out the back-pay bit was just a rumour and no such thing has happened.Given that they pledged at the time that there will be no gender pay parity for the new cast, that sounds like flawed logic.I ADMIRE Louise Redknapp for saying she “lost her identity” during her 19-year marriage to ex-husband Jamie.The former Eternal singer, 43, talked about the fallout of putting her successful career on hold to raise sons Charley, 14 and Beau, nine.I guess what partly happened is that Louise found her identity again after being in the 2016 series of Strictly, followed by the show Cabaret.Having put her life on hold, which would build resentment in even the most giving individual, Louise had a chance to rediscover herself.Either Jamie didn’t like that, or he felt he couldn’t be part of her new life.It’s such a good reminder of the importance of hanging on to your own identity in a marriage.Even if you are the stay-at-home parent, it’s important to find a way not to be the “Wife of” or “Husband of” someone else.And not just to prevent your spouse from losing sight of the person they fell in love with.The real issue is that you can forget who you are yourself.A lot of this comes back to shared parental responsibility.The more equality there is with parenting, the more space there is for both parents to retain their individuality.Here’s some unsolicited advice for any new parents out there.Even if all you think you want to do now is look after your kids, try to find a little bit of space that’s just for you.Hang on to the things that made you you before you had kids and you’ll be doing your marriage a huge favour.But what’s as important as having separate interests and experiences in a relationship is that you grow together.It’s good to take separate paths but make sure you’ve got a shared one too.You’re welcome!\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBRITAIN’S first “legal” red light district, in Holbeck, Leeds, was a great idea – on paper.It was created four years ago with the aim of stopping sex trafficking and violence, and combatting sexually transmitted infections by regulating the sex trade.The problem is, it hasn’t worked.In fact it’s caused a surge in sex and drug-taking in parks and woods – sometimes in view of children.Not only that but the number of reported rapes and sex assaults in the red light district doubled since it launched.There is no perfect solution for the world’s oldest profession.But perhaps we need to start considering a way to create safe and regulated brothels since street-walking is never going to be safe.I WAS sickened to read about the man who “rescued” an 18-year-old British au pair in Naples who had just been raped by two men.Allegedly, he offered to help her but then said, “It’s my turn now”, before raping her again.What kind of despicable human being “rescues” someone only to attack them?In my view, if he is found guilty, whatever sentence he gets should be doubled.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Party members are in open revolt and Ukip are circling like sharks.Labour, meanwhile, has been dragged into a vicious civil war by a racist rabble bent on purging the party of all the people, like Frank Field, who make it worth voting for.Yet as things stand, it is Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxists who would storm to victory in a general election, bringing with them economic chaos, instability and, as night follows day, mass unemployment.What did we do to deserve this, Theresa May?How does this great nation find itself on the brink of political anarchy, paralysis and a Channel blockade on food and medicine?The answer is appalling leadership, dithering diplomacy . . . and a quite incredible failure to speak to the people.So, a round of applause for EU bully-boy Michel Barnier and unelected Brussels puppet master Martin Selmayr for opening our eyes in time.Without their breathtaking arrogance, Britain might have sleep-walked into a humiliating deal which left us half-in, half-out — and paying through the nose for the privilege.Now everyone, including our EU allies, can see Barnier has gone too far by rudely rubbishing Mrs May’s pleas for peace in our time and insisting we still cough up a £39billion ransom.Italian deputy PM Matteo Salvini spoke more clearly for Britain than Mrs May herself when he urged her to stand up to Brussels or walk away.“My experience in the European parliament tells me you either impose yourself or they swindle you,” says Salvini.His sentiments are echoed by other EU leaders bruised by the Brussels jackboot.Privately, many would like to see Barnier and Selmayr given a poke on the nose.All the more disappointing that Ireland, one of those victims, cosies up to Barnier against the country that bailed them out after the 2008 crash.Donald Trump showed how it’s done, with sozzled EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker lurching to Washington on hands and knees for a deal on tariffs.Yet Britain does more trade than America with the EU.While Mrs May dithers, Chancellor Phil Hammond deserves a special place somewhere for leaving us dangerously in the lurch.Thanks to him we are running out of time with virtually nothing in place to soften a crash landing.The mood in Britain has hardened dramatically against Brussels since the “turd- polishing” Chequers summit.Ministers, MPs and even Mrs May’s own local party fear she has already surrendered too much.It is now too late for the traditional EU stitch-up, with Brussels giving an inch and taking a mile. Forget about a second referendum.Leave campaign mastermind Dominic Cummings is right to warn Brexit would win an even bigger majority in the current atmosphere of rank betrayal.Remainers bleat about Brexit dividing the nation for generations to come. In fact, the wounds can ONLY be healed by a successful, clean-cut Brexit.We will NOT sink back into the Dark Ages, cut off from the world, adrift in the North Sea with no friends.More important, a successful Brexit is the ONLY way the Tories will beat off the threat from Labour and Ukip.Under a bolder, more dynamic leader — sooner rather than later — Britain will re-establish itself as a flourishing, tax-competitive trading nation.It is what Brussels, and Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxists, fear above all.Before we know it, we will be into our stride, making our own trade deals and wondering what all this fuss was about.From our new vantage point we will also be looking back at the EU — a bickering, cash-strapped political catastrophe that is already unravelling at huge cost to its member states.Among which, thank goodness, we will no longer be counted.Three Jewish newspapers blasted his refusal to accept the international definition of anti-Semitism.

Britain is a NATO partner but not good enough for such a project?“Now that Davis and Johnson are gone in the UK, the EU should also replace Barnier and Verhofstadt to be able to reach an atmosphere of mutual trust.”Mr Henkel, who sits in the same European political grouping as the UK Conservatives, urged the bloc’s negotiators to accommodate Theresa May’s new plan for alignment on goods secured at Chequers.He said: “The new proposal is better than a hard Brexit or no deal. However, a real customs union would be better and so would be uninterrupted access for financial service institutions.“It is now up to the EU to accommodate demands for British industry and banks to admit that what is good for British business is also good for their continental counterparts.”And the top German MEP also invited top eurocrat Donald Tusk to intervene in the talks and steer Britain away from the exit door.He said the EU Council chief should offer the UK a “new deal” with constraints on free movement to persuade it to stay inside the bloc.He said: “Still better would be for both, Britain and the EU, to call the whole thing off.“For that I ask President Tusk to offer Britain a New Deal, giving it what it always wanted - more autonomy, especially in controlling its immigration.

You’ll be biting your own tail off within three minutes.For if you’re not familiar with him, “Stew,” as he affectionately calls himself, is another of those left-wing comedians who sincerely believes his material is driven by his own overwhelming compassion, despite the fact he seems obsessed with money and clearly hates everyone and almost everything.This includes other far more successful comedians, like Michael McIntyre, their audience, his own audience, the Daily Mail, Tories, “posh men”, Donald Trump and, of course, Brexit.The thing Stewart Lee clearly despises the most, however, is himself.’Cos he can hide behind a persona all he likes, he’s smart enough to know he is just another privately educated Oxbridge graduate telling the people what they should think.He’s also, technically, a very talented comedian, who made me howl with laughter for about as long as he was impersonating Russell Howard.All the cleverly ­inter-woven observations in the world, though, are meaningless if a comedian cannot disguise his own unpleasantness and opens the show, as Lee did, pushing the same foul-mouthed party line you could hear from a thousand other useless, BBC-approved stand-ups.“It wasn’t just racists that voted to leave Europe . . . c***s did as well.

It is an orchestrated plot, backed by millions of pounds . . . a script written the day Remain lost the referendum.The plan was always to reverse defeat by throwing up endless obstacles, by concocting myriad excuses to de-legitimise a vote they would never have questioned had they won . . .  and by relaunching Project Fear to terrify the country about the consequences.Like minds among MPs and the media would amplify each other’s panic in a feedback loop reaching a deafening howl. And they are succeeding. A year ago they seemed resigned to Brexit’s inevitability, but focused on one so soft as to be indistinguishable from Remain.Now, boosted by Government ineptitude, they dream of going one better: a second referendum, its three options cynically designed to skew the result towards staying in, exactly as we are.For two years they lied that they “respect the referendum result”. In truth they hope to annul it before it has even been carried out. And THEIR victory, in the unlikely event it occurred, would of course be final and beyond reproach.It should all be laughable. But No10 is turbo-charging their hopes with the new Project Fear, a barrage of dubious warnings of chaos, recession and wartime shortages in the event of no-deal.The Sun long ago urged the Government to plan seriously for this scenario. But No10 is also using it to intimidate Leave voters into swallowing Theresa May’s wildly unpopular Chequers offer.This not only does the dirty work of the second referendum mob. It paints Britain into a corner with Brussels — with Chequers seemingly our only option and the Government petrified of Angela Merkel finally rejecting it. The Sun always said Brexit could be rocky. Far worse would be to reverse it.Remainers say Leavers shouldn’t want “Brexit chaos on their conscience”. Would it trouble theirs to overturn the biggest UK democratic mandate ever, before its instruction had been fulfilled?To negate the sworn pledges of the Government and Opposition, and Commons votes carried by huge majorities?

with forecasters warning the mercury will hit 30C across the South of England by Friday.While the south is blasted with sun, northern parts of the UK will continue to see showers with temperatures sitting in the mid 20s.A spokeswoman for the Met Office said on Tuesday: In terms of the weekend just gone, they were the first two days this month where temperatures havent reached 25C (77F) but we have got back to that point today, it hit 25.3C (77.5F) in Cavendish in Suffolk so its already starting to warm up again.Over the next few days there will be something of a north and south split - high pressure is already starting to build up in the south, bringing dry, fine and weather.She warned: Southern England and Wales are going to turn quite hot by Friday - temperatures will probably reach 30C (86F) by that point.This is likely to include quite a wide area across the southern part of the UK - it will widely hit 30C (86F) across southern England and Wales, and the very hot weather will return as we approach the weekend.The north of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland can expect outbreaks of much-needed rain on Tuesday, Wednesday and in to Thursday.The spokeswoman said: Its a more varied picture across the north but its an improving situation - sunshine with some showers and a similar story across the weekend.By Friday the temperatures could get into the mid 20s, so warming up, just not as hot as it is in the south.The weather broke on Friday, treating the parched landscape to a deluge of rain.It meant this July will be wetter than the blistering heatwave of July 1976.An average 49.9mm of rain fell across the UK from July 1 to July 29, according to provisional figures from the Met Office, and with further rain expected this week, the final total could be higher.The UK suffered a long heatwave during the summer of 1976, which helped make July 1976 the joint ninth driest on record.Currently, July this year is the 13th driest on record, the Met Office said.The driest ever July was in 1955, when an average of 30.6mm rainfall was measured across the UK.Comparable records for rainfall date back to 1910."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000423926194.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"great pyramid of giza egypt electromagnetic energy","story":"The mysterious structure was built by the Ancient Egyptians thousands of years ago – and experts are only just learning about its amazing powers.Boffins from ITMO University and the Laser Zentrum Hannover found that the 481-foot building is capable of creating pockets of higher energy in its inner rooms and at its base.The research group plans to use the results to design nanoparticles, which will be used to develop sensors and highly efficient solar cells, reports The Journal of Applied Physics.Dr Andrey Evlyukhin, scientific supervisor and coordinator of the study, said: “Egyptian pyramids have always attracted great attention.“We as scientists were interested in them as well, so we decided to look at the Great Pyramid as a particle dissipating radio waves resonantly.“Due to the lack of information about the physical properties of the pyramid, we had to use some assumptions.“For example, we assumed that there are no unknown cavities inside, and the building material with the properties of an ordinary limestone is evenly distributed in and out of the pyramid.“With these assumptions made, we obtained interesting results that can find important practical applications.”Researchers modelled the distribution of electromagnetic fields inside the Great Pyramid of Giza while studying the interactions of electrical waves.Scientists have deduced that the pyramid concentrates this electromagnetic energy in its hidden chambers, which includes rooms containing the remains of Pharoah Khufu and his wife.There is also a third, unfinished chamber beneath the base of the huge structure.And the team’s analysis shows that the powerful pyramid concentrates electromagnetic energy in its internal chambers.These hidden rooms include the chamber holding the mummified body of Pharaoh Khufu – who the iconic monument was built for – and another built for his wife.But scientists believe the unusual discovery about the electromagnetic energy in the pyramid are just a coincidence.They believe it is highly unlikely Ancient Egyptians knew anything about the science behind it and would not have built it in this way deliberately.The pyramid took 20 years to build using around 100,000 slaves.Scientists now plan to use the incredible discovery on a much smaller scale, which could create effective solar cells.The higher energy can be used to develop extremely sensitive solar cells or even tiny sensors."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000423925391.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"erin town sea parasite devon infection cryptosporidiosis","story":"Erin Town swam with her friends almost daily at Wildersmouth Beach in Ilfracombe last month when she contracted what she thought was an ear infection.But within the days the schoolgirls temperature had soared to 40C and she had a racking cough - which the doctor initially put down to tonsillitis.Disturbing symptoms also included bad stomach cramps and heavy vomiting.Terrified mum Paulina parent took her to North Devon District Hospital, where they found she had contracted cryptosporidium.The vile parasite can live in the intestines of humans and animals and be spread through soil and water - such as when humans accidentally swallow contaminated water.Paulina told Devon Live: When I told the nurse that she had been swimming there, she pulled a bit of a face and said several people had been ill after swimming there.She said she wouldnt even take her dog in the water there.Erin was discharged after one night at the hospital before she had to be readmitted on Thursday for a second night.Paulina said: I was absolutely petrified, it was awful.Children and people with weakened immune systems are the most at risk of falling ill.Boiling the water kills the parasite and makes it safe to drink.The parasite can live in the intestines of humans and animals.It is spread to people through soil, water, or surfaces that have been contaminated with the poo of an infected person.Humans most often become infected when they accidentally swallow something that has come into contact with infected stool, swallowing contaminated water in pools, hot tubs, streams and water systems, and eating uncooked contaminated food.It is is one of the most common causes of waterborne diseases.Weve lived in Ilfracombe for 12 years now and I never knew that you werent supposed to swim at that beach.

A ministry spokesman would only say: “We will use the opportunity of Brexit to take back control of our borders and strengthen border security. We are considering a range of options for the future immigration system and will set out more details later this year.”We will need plenty of visible signs that we have left the EU, and this is one.While we’re at it, let’s get those Brexit stamps printed up for next March. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It brought record-breaking viewing figures for ITV2, with the launch show in June attracting the channel\u0027s largest ever audience with 2.9 million viewers.That figure was topped just a few weeks into the run, with three million viewers tuning in mid-week.But why is it so successful? An idyllic location (Majorca), beautiful contestants and plenty of screen time (six hour-long episodes per week) certainly gave the show a boost from the start.BAFTA-winning presenter Iain Stirling\u0027s quippy voiceover also helps to lubricate the on-screen action.Stirling studied law at Edinburgh University before going on to present children\u0027s TV and earning his presenter stripes alongside a scruffy terrier puppet called Hacker. The voice of Love Island, he now dates former MTV presenter and Love Island fan Laura Whitmore - who apparently pumps him for Island gossip on a regular basis.And she\u0027s not the only celebrity fan - ex-Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, rapper Stormzy (who made a surprise appearance during last year\u0027s series three) and DJ Nick Grimshaw have all expressed a liking for the reality show.American hotel heiress Paris Hilton appears to be watching too, tweeting to her 18 million followers: \"@LoveIsland Jack \u0026 Dani are goals! 😍 #LoveIsland\". There\u0027s even the odd minor-celebrity thrown in to give the show a little star dust, with Danny Dyer\u0027s daughter Dani (yes, really) eventually justifying her status as favourite to win.Dani and pen salesman Jack Fincham have been coupled since the start, and say they plan to move in together now the show has come to an end.The popular pair have even received the thumbs up from The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds thanks to Jack\u0027s penchant for bird watching during his time in the villa. Winning an A* for ingenuity, the show\u0027s producers even managed to wangle an appearance of sorts from Daddy Dyer over the weekend.The always awkward meeting of boyfriend and father was given an extra excruciating twist, with Jack meeting the EastEnders actor over Facetime.Luckily the soap star, who was speaking from his family holiday in Florida, said he \"approved\" of Fincham, telling him \"I think you\u0027re absolutely bang on\" and a \"proper geezer\".He also told him he had a bit of a belly using cockney rhyming slang - a classic Dyer move. Viewers were quick to share their love for Danny\u0027s appearance on social media, hailing it the best moment of the series so far.The highest-rated show across all channels in its 9pm time slot, it is not just Britons who love it. Love Island is now produced in seven other countries.Within 24 hours of launching last month, Love Island Australia received the largest catch-up service ratings for an Australian reality TV show ever. With three successful series behind it, the UK show even took home a BAFTA earlier this year, winning the award for best reality show and paving the way for the current series\u0027 success.Thorpe Park has opened its own Love Island-themed attraction - complete with beach - this summer.And more than one university student has written a dissertation on the reality show.Labour MP Stella Creasy tweeted amid the Brexit votes to say she hoped he was all right.The show even had its own underdog.Unlucky in love Alex, an A\u0026E doctor from Wales, won the hearts of the nation before being dumped from the villa just one day before the final. One fan explained her newfound love for the show: \"It\u0027s the first series I\u0027ve ever watched, but I\u0027m addicted. It\u0027s the same appeal as Big Brother. Seeing into people\u0027s lives - into relationships which are normally secret. You know they\u0027re not real, but it doesn\u0027t matter.\"Plus, as a girl, you get to see how the men act when they are with a date, and then how their behaviour changes when they are with their friends. And then again, how that dynamic changes when they interact with the girl\u0027s mates.\"It\u0027s on six nights a week but I wish it was seven. I look forward to 9pm. Most of my friends watch it too. And every episode ends on a cliff-hanger, so you have to watch it the next day.\" The world, it seems, cannot get enough.With the show recently commissioned in Denmark, Finland and Norway, there will be a version of Love Island on somewhere around the world every single day between now and Christmas.A daily Love Island podcast which dissects each night\u0027s antics - presented by Kem Cetinay, one half of last year\u0027s winning couple, and DJ Arielle Free - has barely been out of the top spot on the iTunes podcast chart since launching at the end of May. Free - who appeared in one of the Harry Potter films and briefly worked as a foot model - landed the job as Morning After podcast host after throwing her own Love Island final party last year.A true Love Island fan, she puts the success of the show down to its authenticity: \"It\u0027s a real insight into how we function as adults when it comes to dating. There are always those moments you can relate to - the uncertainty, the lust, the love.\"Last year\u0027s show moved away from all the sex and focused more on the relationships between people, I think that\u0027s why everyone became so gripped. You want them to fall in love, you want them to work and you\u0027re always rooting for someone or a couple. I genuinely feel heartache when it doesn\u0027t work out for some of them.\" Love Island commissioning editor Amanda Stavri agrees that the tone of the show is of primary importance. Explaining how the production team carefully edit any intimate scenes, she says: \"It\u0027s really important that it\u0027s not a salacious show - that it isn\u0027t grubby.\"Stavri also puts its success down to \"not being full of conflict\" and the fact \"it doesn\u0027t feel exploitative\".When whittling down the vast numbers of entries, producers insist they don\u0027t cast for potential conflict, instead relying on the natural dating dynamic to create tension.Some 85,000 people applied to be on the show this year - more than double the number of applicants for Oxbridge. Love Island producer Richard Cowles has called the non-scripted show \"aspirational, relatable and all about falling in love\".However, Cowles goes on: \"If people don\u0027t like it they don\u0027t have to watch. We\u0027re not pretending to be anything other than an entertainment show that\u0027s a distraction from real life.\"Geared towards a younger audience, over half of Love Island\u0027s launch night viewers were aged 16-34.Only Britain\u0027s Got Talent - shown on ITV\u0027s main channel - has attracted a bigger audience for that demographic on any channel so far this year. Arielle Free says the show\u0027s success is in large part down to the hard work of the production team: \"I think Love Island winning the BAFTA was a true reflection of what audiences are consuming and enjoying. It\u0027s such a great accolade, especially for all the cast and crew who work tirelessly over the year and the two months in the villa to make it as entertaining and memorable as possible.\"It\u0027s also possible that Love Island can put its popularity down to the simple fact that people love to see their own experiences reflected on screen.If you take away the location, honed physiques and perfect hair, what you are left with is people attempting to connect, along with all the pitfalls and pleasures that come along with that gamble."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-alphabet-zoo-bradford_4377080.jpg?20180801003851 ","title":"major incident as man storms childrens play centre in bradford","story":"\"He jumped onto a group of people including myself but landed on his back after he had taken us down, so he was seriously injured.\"\"He was apprehended by police and staff who calmed him down.\"A spokesman said he could not confirm if there were any casualties during the incident at the Cemetery Road centre.A Facebook post from Alphabet Zoo said: \"Due to major incident, the Alphabet Zoo is currently closed, but we will re-open as soon as we can."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-burst-pipe-water-leak_4376960.jpg?20180731193640 ","title":"michael gove water companies must raise the bar on tackling leaks","story":"\"I have asked the companies I spoke to today to raise the bar on tackling leaks and agree ambitious new targets when they submit their business plans to Ofwat in September,\" Mr Gove said.\"The Government, Ofwat and customers expect water companies to improve their performance.\" He also said that \"we all have to deal\" and \"adapt\" as the consequences of climate change pose a challenge to the industry.The meeting was called following low levels in some reservoirs and the introduction of a hosepipe ban from 5 August.\"We know how important it is for customers, and since the mid-1990s companies have successfully managed to reduce leakage levels by a third.\"He admitted that there is \"more to do\" in terms of leakage issues, adding that companies are currently finalising plans to cut leakage \"by at least 15%\"."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy hunt buys peace offering","story":"NewsJeremy Hunt buys peace offering for his wife after monumental gaffeThe Foreign Secretary has been pictured picking out some flowersShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter16:56, 31 JUL 2018Updated17:42, 31 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJeremy Hunt has picked out a peace offering for his wife, after yesterday\u0027s monumental gaffe where he got her nationality wrong.

Ahead of talks with his opposite numbers in France and Austria on Tuesday and Wednesday, the Foreign Secretary insisted that if Brussels fails to strike a withdrawal agreement with the UK it would cause job losses on both sides of the Channel if Brexit goes wrong. Mr Hunt accused the European Commission of waiting for Britain to blink in Brexit talks as he urged Paris and Berlin to put pressure on Brussels to cut a deal.  He told the London Evening Standard: The probability of no deal is increasing by the day until we see a change of approach from the European Commission who have this view that they just need to wait and Britain will blink. That is just a profound misunderstanding of us as a nation. There is real chance of no deal by accident. Everyone is assuming, no, no, no, this will never happen. Well, actually, it could. France and Germany have to send a strong signal to the commission that we need to negotiate a pragmatic and sensible outcome that protects jobs on both sides of the Channel because for every job lost in the UK, there will be jobs lost in Europe as well if Brexit goes wrong.

It’s the first trial sparked by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe. But despite Manafort’s indictment having sprouted from the investigation into alleged links between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government, the prosecution don\u0027t plan to try to prove collusion with Russia in this case. But that’s not to say the President’s lawyers won’t be watching the courtroom very, very closely over the coming days. Here’s everything you need to know about Paul Manafort, what he’s accused of, and how it could be bad news for Donald Trump Who is Paul Manafort?  Paul Manafort, 69, is a veteran lobbyist, political consultant and a laywer. He spent a decade working for the Party of Regions in Ukraine - the party of disgraced pro-Russian ex-President Viktor Yanukovych - building a deep contacts book in Ukrainian politics. In March 2016 he accepted a role on Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign team as campaign manager, a job he held for three months before resigning in August.  Manafort is on trial in Virginia on tax and bank fraud charges. He faces 18 criminal counts, which centre on allegations that he hid much of the $60 million he earned in Ukraine in undisclosed overseas bank accounts and failed to pay taxes on it. Prosecutors also accuse him of lying to U.S. banks to obtain real estate loans in a bid to fund expensive suits and maintain a lavish lifestyle after his client, Yanukovych, fell from power in 2014 and the money stopped. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. Is he facing any other charges?  Yes. He’s co-defendant in a trial in Washington DC, where he’s charged with money laundering, failing to register as a foreign agent and witness tampering. He’s pleaded not guilty to those charges too. That trial is a lot more likely to focus on trying to prove collusion with Russia.

The raiders struck at the 30-room mansion of biotech multi-millionaire Sir Christopher Evans OBE, and made off with \u0026pound1million worth of gems belonging to Lady Anne Evans. CCTV shows the gang brazenly strolling back and forth across the grounds of the Evans\u0027 mansion in broad daylight, carrying several basket-loads of their loot. It is thought that the four suspects scaled a seven-foot wall to gain entry to the grounds, whilst Lady Anne took her dog Scooter for a walk. Amongst the high-value jewellery and antiques taken from the mansion were four George III silver candlesticks, a gold and amethyst choker, and a late 19th century gold, diamond and sapphire tiara. Distraught Lady Anne also lost an 18-ct white gold diamond ring, an 18-ct yellow gold brooch set with four pearls, and a platinum and white gold diamond line Cartier bracelet in the raid.   Swimmer\u0027s arm severed and another\u0027s leg amputated after they are hit by speedboat propeller in Majorca  And three Art Nouveau silver rose bowls were also taken, dating back to 1901, and with the embossed inscription Flowers are the playthings fair left by angels long ago. The jewellery and antiques had an estimated value in excess of one million pounds, and it is believed the offenders made off in a grey or silver Audi S5, headed in the direction of Cirencester. Gloucestershire Police are now investigating the theft, which took place on July 9 between 5pm and 8pm at Glebe House in the quiet village of Bibury, Glos. Sir Christopher, an internationally renowned life sciences entrepreneur who is worth \u0026pound158million, has spoken of the audacity of the burglars. He said: On behalf of my family I am offering a substantial reward for information that will lead to the conviction of these thieves. It is a sign of the times that people have the audacity to scale a perimeter wall in broad daylight and walk across open grounds to steal from someone\u0027s home. We\u0027ve lived in Bibury for many years and have never encountered anything like this before.   Man legally changes gender \u0027so he can get cheaper car insurance as woman\u0027  Of course, there is always a financial loss when something happens like this, but the real pain comes from what these stolen items mean and symbolise in our lives. The burglary has had a particularly devastating effect on my wife Anne as many of the pieces of jewellery, silver and ceramics have huge sentimental value for us both. For example, Anne\u0027s engagement ring, her late father\u0027s signet ring - the only thing she has left of him. Then there is an irreplaceable rose Ramsden and Carr rose bowl - dated London 1901 - and a diamond ring I bought my wife when our first child was born - which cost almost our entire savings at that point. There are many small value and large items that have been stolen but they all have the same emotional and sentimental impact. Detective Constable Faye Satchwell-Bennett, who is investigating the burglary, added: We are trying to identify the offenders and ask that members of the public watch the CCTV footage and think back to that day. Do you know who these people are? Did you see a silver or grey vehicle driving at speed through Bibury between these times or anything suspicious that may help with our investigation? As with any other burglary this has had a marked impact on the victims.

The two minute and 20 second clip shows him buying the bleach before heading back to a house and putting it in a bathtub.  Carmie, who lives in Surrey and blogs under the name Touchdalight , then adds water and climbs in bit by bit, finishing by dunking his face in the liquid.  Some fans have said the video is fake, but people are saying it is still irresponsible to share it.  Many are concerned it will inspire other young people to copy his idea and some fear it might start the latest dangerous internet trend. The video, which has been viewed more than 1.8million times, was shared with the caption: This is the dumbest s*** I ever done. The video starts with him walking around a shop with a basket buying the bleach, before cutting to a bathroom where he fills the bath tub with five bottles of the liquid. He then adds water and puts his hand in to see what it\u0027s like.  When he pulls his hand out it looks bright red, with sections of skin peeling off. He then climbs into the tub and covers his body in the liquid, while continuing to speak to the camera and saying repeatedly how much it hurts. Finally, he gets on his knees and dips his face into the water and holds it for several seconds.

CCTV showed Steven Harvey, 45, and Claire Hillier, 42, cavorting under the blue blanket for eight minutes on a sunny summer afternoon. The area in Plymouth, Devon was busy with adults and children on their way home as the pair appeared to be romping in broad daylight, a court heard.  But Harvey and Hillier denied they were having sex and were spared jail when accepted that they were faking intercourse, Plymouth Live reports.  Harvey and Hillier went on trial at Plymouth Crown Court but then pleaded guilty to outraging public decency.  They were handed an 18-month community order on Tuesday by Plymouth\u0027s resident Judge Paul Darlow. I hope we don\u0027t meet again, because if you do, it\u0027s because you have breached this order, Judge Darlow told the defendants. An exclusion order was also considered that would have prevented Harvey and Hillier from going into the city centre for six months. But the court heard both needed access to banks in the city centre, and that Hillier had items in a pawn shop that needed to be picked up, so the order wasn\u0027t imposed. The court was shown footage of the couple frolicking under a blanket on a grassed area on August 3 last year before police arrived.

Husband Stewart Rawnsley told the hearing that his wife lay bleeding from every orifice in a hospital bed as his insurance company insisted she should not be moved to the mainland. Westminster Coroner\u0027s Court heard that Natalie, from Harpenden, Hertfordshire, rapidly deteriorated in just 36 hours after consuming the chicken at a hotel restaurant. She died after blood clots formed all over her body and blocked the vessels last August. Her devastated twin sister Michelle Martin, 38, posted a heartbreaking tribute to Natalie following her death, reports The Sun.   Sharing a picture on Facebook of the two of them smiling, she wrote: My baby, my soul Mate, best big sister, best godmother, best aunty, best daughter, best wife and above all the best mother to my beautiful nephews.  Natalie was just beginning the second week of her trip with husband Stewart and two young sons when tragedy struck. Stuart said his wife had complained that evening of feeling unwell, but had not said anything specific about how she felt ill. He was woken at 3am when Natalie started throwing up in the hotel bathroom. A doctor came the next day and diagnosed Natalie with gastroenteritis - he then told Stewart and the children to leave her bedside to prevent them from catching the illness.  Stewart was later told by text message that Natalie had been moved from the medical centre to Corfu hospital in the early evening. Stewart said: The hospital was on the other side of the island about 70km away from my memory. The A\u0026ampE department was empty. My wife was down the end of the room surrounded by about eight people. She was fully awake and aware, and happy to see me, but obviously distressed and concerned. There was pain in her legs and she had also had a number of red blotches all over her. The inquest heard that a nurse, who said she was the head of international medicine, said they wanted to fly Natalie to a hospital on the mainland, which had better facilities. However Natalie\u0027s condition quickly deteriorated as her family members, including her brother and niece, gathered by her bedside.

Medical student Anna Stevens and biochemistry graduate Kathryn Coulson, both 21, were on top of Mount Rinjani when the 6.4 tremor struck on Sunday, killing at least 16 people on the island .  They were at the summit when the quake began and were told by tour guides to run to the centre of the volcano and shelter behind a rock as boulders flew past them. Miss Stevens, from Neasham, and Miss Coulson, from Middleton St George, near Darlington, Co Durham, were stuck on the volcano until Monday because many of the trails and bridges had been destroyed and they were among hundreds of tourists trapped there overnight.  Their families faced an anxious wait until the British Embassy traced the former Hurworth School pupils. The women eventually managed to get into an area for a mobile phone signal to call their loved ones. Miss Coulson’s aunt Victoria Toas said: “They actually believed the volcano was erupting until they spoke to us and we told them it was an earthquake. “They were absolutely terrified. There were boulders flying past them and then there were aftershocks.”  She said they had learned there had been looting in following the earthquake and there were concerns that the pair may not have passports to leave the island. But later, she added: “I have just spoken to Kathryn and they have located their passports and luggage and are heading to the port. So thankfully all is well.” The students saw an army truck heading up the mountain to collect bodies as they descended, so it was feared the official death toll may increase.  The earthquake early on Sunday killed 16 people, including an Indonesian student who was among the Mount Rinjani climbers. The shallow quake set off landslides on the rocky mountainside, blocking the normal pathways out. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency had said more than 680 people were stranded on Rinjani, based on figures from its entry gates where visitors are registered. Most are foreign - from 26 countries - including more than 330 from Thailand.  The Foreign office said last night that six Britons who registered to climb the mountain confirmed to officials that they had made their way safely to its base – but others may have gone unreported. More than 1,400 homes were damaged on the island after the tremors struck from a shallow depth, which tends to inflict greater devastation. Indonesia’s meteorology and geophysics agency has recorded more than 270 aftershocks. President Joko Widodo said the government would give each family whose home was destroyed 50 million rupiah (\u0026pound2,670) to rebuild.

There is a possibility an \u0026shyintermediary could meet with him and appeal to him to stop making such hurtful \u0026shystatements. “The final option would be for Meghan to cut him off completely in the hope he will stop, but the \u0026shysituation is so precarious no one knows when that would be.”  There are fears if Meghan does make contact with Thomas he will reveal details of the conversation or sell his story. Both Harry, 33, and Meghan are \u0026shyunderstood to be angry at a recent TV interview when Thomas revealed details of conversations with the prince, including his views on Brexit and US President Donald Trump.

A poll of 2,000 Brits saw nearly three in 10 select the Monty Python legend as the best export from the northern region. Second on the list was gruff actor Sean Bean, followed by Sir Patrick Stewart. Halifax-born Ed Sheeran came fourth with Jeremy Clarkson rounding out the top five.  Dame Judi Dench was chosen by almost half of respondents as the greatest ever Yorkshirewoman, followed by Jess Ennis-Hill and the Bront\u0026euml sisters. The study was conducted by the energy supplier npower to celebrate Yorkshire Day on August 1st. Commercial Director at npower and proud Yorkshireman, Andy Wiggans, said: “Yorkshire Day is a reason to celebrate everything brilliant about the UK’s biggest county, and there’s no shortage of legendary Yorkshire folk to pick from with a list like this. “We wanted to give the nation the chance to think about the region and how much it’s given the country – and the rest of the world. “After all, where would we be without Monty Python’s dead parrot sketch – inspired by Michael Palin’s disastrous trip to a mechanic, who refused to accept there was something wrong with his car?” When asked to think about Yorkshire, the first thing that springs to mind for Brits is Yorkshire pudding, with one in five saying the Sunday roast staple is the single best thing to have originated from the region.  A further 14 per cent believe the ‘catseye’ reflective road stud is Yorkshire’s greatest export while one in 10 selected the creation of the world’s first commercial steam locomotive, which was built in Holbeck by engineer Matthew Murray in 1812. It also emerged two thirds of the country have either visited Yorkshire or lived there are some point in their lives, with 34 per cent still to visit. And a tenth of respondents loved their time there so much they’d consider making the move permanently. This could be due to the lilting accent, which 45 per cent of Brits say they’re happy to hear. However, an incredible one in eight Brits admit they’d struggle to locate Yorkshire on a map of the UK.  Researchers also found Yorkshire’s reputation for being careful with money is well-founded, with a tenth of Brits believing people from the county are better at looking after the pennies than those from elsewhere. And twice as many people think those from Yorkshire are more likely to be careful when it comes to saving energy than anywhere else in the UK. Andy added: “Whether you’ve been once, twice or lived there for years, it’s great to see how much the area has contributed to society. “We’ve generated some of the most famous names throughout history – and it’s exciting to wonder who the next will be.”  THE TOP 10 BEST EVER YORKSHIREMEN  1.

The 33-year-old, who won the sixth series of The Great British Bake Off , has written numerous cook books and now has her own BBC Two Show, Nadiya\u0027s Family Favourites.  Aired on Monday evenings, the show often has viewers\u0027 mouths watering - and this week was no exception. Monday night\u0027s episode featured a recipe for carrot cake pakoras - a unique twist on an Indian dish.  The chef showed food fans how to make a batch of the deep fried spiced cakes, which are served with a cream cheese dip. A pakora is traditionally a savoury fritter, but Nadiya says she was inspired to combine it with cake as part of a crazy middle-of-the-night idea. She explained: People deep fry chocolate bars so why not deep fry cake batter? She added that it was a great way to use up any leftover carrots you have around the house.  People on Twitter went wild for her quirky creation, with people even going as far as to demand the Queen make her a dame for the invention. One person said: Carrot cake pakoras???

Researchers polling 1,000 kids aged six to 12 found many are clueless about where their fruit really comes from. So much so, half of kids don\u0027t know that blackcurrants grow on bushes and a further six in 10 were unaware grapes sprout on vines. Eight in 10 kids even believe bananas grow on trees rather than on plants.  In response to the findings, author and TV personality Katie Piper has teamed up with organic fruit drink Honest Kids to invite a group of children to spend a day on a real fruit farm.  Swapping their trainers for wellies for the very first time, the city kids got to grip with how apples, grapes and berries are grown.  Mother of two Katie Piper said: “I’m really excited to be working with Honest kids to encourage more families to get outdoors this summer, visit their local pick-your-own fruit farms and learn more about how fruit is grown. “A pick-your-own fruit picnic is a great summer activity to do together as a family and a fun way to re-engage with nature whilst also learning a little more about where our food comes from.” The study found four in 10 baffled little Brits think cherries originate from bushes, vines or plants, while 14 per cent think melons grow under the ground. More than nine in 10 kids have no idea how strawberries or cranberries are grown.  Just under half of those polled were confused about where plums came from, 53 per cent don’t know how apricots are grown and 88 per cent are baffled about the origin of pineapples. Researchers also found the average British child eats up to 10 pieces of fruit a week, with bananas the top choice (32 per cent), followed by grapes (28 per cent), apples (25 per cent), mangoes and pineapples (13 per cent). But despite a relatively healthy consumption of fruit, even by their teenage years, some children don’t have a clear understanding of where it grows. It also emerged three in 10 kids have never picked their own fruit before and three in four haven’t ever visited an orchard. However, four in 10 do want to visit a fruit farm this summer to learn more. Brand ambassador Katie Piper will be appearing with Honest Kids at the GO! Organic festival on the 8th September in Battersea Park, London. She added: “It’s really refreshing as a busy mother of two to find a product like Honest kids which is so simply made with just water and organic fruit juice – perfect for on-the-go refreshments during the hectic summer months.” "},{"url":null,"title":"paddy dohertys nephew mikey connors","story":"Mikey Connors, in his 30s, was today remembered as a ÒloyalÓ family man after the fatal crash unfolded in southeast London on Saturday morning.\" content=\"https://i2-prod.mirror/incoming/article13010358.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/3_Screen-Shot-2018-07-31-at-160046.jpg\"/Mikey Connors died following a collision after a fatal crash on Saturday morningGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBig Fat Gypsy Wedding\u0027s Paddy Doherty is going through another tragic loss in his family after his nephew was killed in a horse and cart crash. Mikey Connors - described as a loyal family man - died following a collision on Eastern Way, Thamesmead on Saturday morning. The 30-year-old was horse racing when the incident happened.  When he did not cross the finishing line, concerned family and friends went back to look for him and made the tragic discovery. The death will come as a devastating blow to Mikey\u0027s uncle Paddy, who has lost several family members in just over a year. Doherty laid his mother to rest in April after revealing she died of a broken heart - following the death of her beloved husband.  Known as Queenie, Elizabeth Doherty suffered a massive heart attack just days after a headstone was placed on the grave of her much-loved spouse, Simon. Simon, known as Simey, died a year earlier after battling an illness and his funeral drew hundreds of mourners as he was remembered and celebrated as the father of all travellers. And in October 2017, the teenage nephew of the Big Fat Gypsy Weddings star tragically died in a car crash. Tom \u0027Tomboy\u0027 Doherty was only 17-years-old when he was killed following a collision in South Nutfield.  Since Mikey\u0027s death yesterday, Paddy\u0027s wife Roseanne paid tribute to him and said that everyone is in shock. Family and friends have since paid tribute to the dad on social media. Brother Simey Connors wrote: “I promised you (to) stay strong Mikey. “It’s getting harder already you don’t understand how much I miss you brother.”  Another friend added: Such a huge loss and all we can live for is memories and remember the smiles he gave everyone. Met Police have confirmed that they are investigating the tragedy and a 30-year-old man has since been arrested on suspicion of death by dangerous driving.

Martin Fitzgerald, of Manchester, Josh Ekim, 26, of London, and Daley Thompson, 27, of Cardiff faced prison sentences on their respective tripes in Thailand, Greece and Spain after getting into trouble from police abroad. Father-of-one Mr Thompson could have spent 15 years in a Greek prison after him and two of his friends were discovered with \u0026pound8,000 of cocaine in party island Malia, on the island of Crete, two years ago. After his first night on a stag do in Ibiza, Mr Fitzgerald was also arrested and falsely accused of assaulting a police officer after the group were involved in a fight with a group of revellers at the Spanish party hotspot.  Meanwhile Mr Ekim had to pay \u0026pound1,500 to Thai police in Phuket after crashing into another moped following an alcohol-fuelled night with his friends. Each of their experiences are told in a four-part 5Star series called Young, Dumb, and Banged Up in the Sun. This features young Britons who have been put behind bars abroad while on holiday or living as expats. Stories include a mix of those who are guilty as well as those who are innocent, including one who was falsely accused of murder. They include those who are guilty, and others imprisoned for crimes they didn’t commit - including one falsely accused of murder. Here, ahead of the first episode on Wednesday night, here are the stories of Martin Fitzgerald, Josh Ekim and Daley Thompson.  Daley Thompson, 26, Cardiff  Location: Malia, Greece Why he was arrested: Accused of possessing, smuggling and dealing cocaine  In the summer of 2016, Thompson along with his friends Kyle and Joel went on holiday to Malia in Crete. He said: We had a ball, we went out partying, we had a laugh dancing with the girls, the usual stuff. They had met a group of English men earlier on in their trip who had cocaine and offered to introduce them to their dealer an \u0027Albanian man down the strip\u0027. After meeting the dealers the following day, they purchased four-and-a-half ounces of the Class A drug but because it was more expensive in smaller amounts they bought it in bulk. While they did not intend to sell it themselves, Thompson and his friends began making double the street value, which in Malia is \u0026pound80 per gram. He said: They would rather buy from us rather than go to the Albanian guys. We were just having a laugh until the fifth day, everything went wrong.  After a drug-fuelled night police raided their flat and found more than \u0026pound8,000 of cocaine in the apartment fridge. The three were taken to Neapolis jail, where they got caught in the middle of a gang war between Greek and Albanian prisoners, before Thompson was transferred to the notorious Alikarnassos prison following an altercation in his cell. He kept to himself while he was surrounded by dangerous prisoners including Mexican drug cartels, Pakistani drug bosses, and the Chinese Mafia who were chopping people\u0027s body parts off. The group admitted possession but denied charges of supplying and smuggling. The minimum sentence for smuggling is 15 years. Following an eight month stint in prison, Thompson was found guilty of possession and selling the drug but not smuggling. They were all sentenced to four years in jail with a three-year suspended sentence but as they had already served nearly a year they were released straight away. Thompson said: I missed my son\u0027s birthday... I lost my girlfriend, I lost everything,\u0027 I know I was having fun for the first five days but look where I am. It was disgusting. It was like a hellhole in there.  Martin Fitzgerald, Manchester  Location: Ibiza, Spain Why he was arrested: Accused of assaulting a police officer  Along with ten of his friends, Mr Fitzgerald travelled to Ibiza for a stag do for the first wedding of all of their friends. Following hours of heavy drinking on the first night, the group headed to party hot spot of San Antonio but became involved in an altercation outside a nightclub two Spanish partygoers are said to have drawn a knife inside. After his friends moved onto the next bar, Fitzgerald stayed but was eventually identified by police as a suspect. He said: I went over to the police officers to put the story straight. As soon as I went over to introduce myself, they got a grip on my arm. After breaking free from the officer\u0027s grasp, he ran through the streets before being arrested in another bar. Mr Fitzgerald was then moved to San Antonio police station, where he was accused of assaulting the police officer who had chased him which could see him face a year in prison. He came before a judge three years later who offered him a deal in exchange for a guilty plea to the assault charge. His 12-month prison term was then reduced to a suspended sentence, and he was immediately released. Fitzgerald said:  I gave a big sigh of relief. I went to the British Consulate and they advised me to stay in the room and get the flight home the next day.

Survey after survey reveals that many young people struggle with relationships .  But many parents feel embarrassed to talk about relationships and sex, especially if they’ve experienced relationship breakdown themselves. We can’t leave young people flailing about in what’s now a toxic environment for healthy relationships.  It’s imperative that RSE (relationship and sex education) classes arm pupils with solid advice which helps them address real relationship themes that affect them in countless ways and which will affect every serious relationship they have in the future.  Here are 10 lessons which I would advocate.  Learn the Five F Factors before committing to each other These factors determine long-term compatibility and harmony and are also the source of many divorces:  Finances and how much you agree/disagree on spending and saving.   Family – and how much time you are willing to spend with your respective families.   Friendships and what part they play in your day-to-day life.   Fun and leisure and how you may have very different expectations for how to spend, such as on weekends and holidays.   Frisky factor – your sexual compatibility.  Marriage won’t solve a problem relationship Always keep in mind that problems you have remain the same after marriage unless you work on them. Also don’t go into marriage believing “love will conquer all” because it doesn’t. For instance, it’s totally unrealistic to believe that if you give you partner all your love, they’ll change issues they have like addiction. They won’t. What you see is the personality you get. The person they are doesn’t miraculously change with a wedding band. If they’re unreliable, disrespectful or a cheat, this will continue after your vows unless you both work on it. A wedding isn\u0027t the same as a marriage Many people get so involved in the excitement building to the big day that they struggle afterwards, wishing the excitement could continue. Keep one foot on the ground when caught up in your perfect wedding plans. Married life will have more highs for you to enjoy but it’ll also have lows.  Cherish your self-esteem It’s essential that youngsters learn about building self-esteem and how good relationships are impossible without good self-esteem. With mental health issues on the rise in teens, far too many struggle.  Good self-esteem is all about knowing who their partner is, accepting that their feelings  count, and recognising when they need support.  It includes having the self-belief that they can move forward successfully with a person and will not crumble in the face of life and relationship hurdles. Respect and responsibility for yourself and others Many teenagers struggle with understanding what self-respect and respect are. It’s about valuing themselves and their needs, and equally valuing their boyfriend or girlfriend’s needs. Lack of self–respect makes it difficult for them to set boundaries when a boyfriend or girlfriend treats them badly. Equally, they need to be aware of how to respect a partner, and to accept it when they say yes or no to something. It’s essential young people realise that relationships are two-way streets. It’s no good getting caught in the blame game, always saying it’s the other person’s fault when things get difficult. Instead they must understand their responsibility for how a relationship is progressing. They must share responsibility for the wellbeing of their relationship, whatever their age.  Talking and listening  Many teens fear rejection, meaning that they don’t want to risk asking for something they need within  the relationship.  They don’t want to rock the boat or appear to be a burden. Equally, many adults get into the trap of believing they’re mind readers when it comes to what their partner wants. Learning to truly listen is vital for any successful long-term relationship. Never be pressured into sex until you are ready Whether 17 or 37, no-one should ever have sex before they’re ready. If you’re nurturing your self-esteem and respecting yourself, you’ll be able to tell your partner you’re not ready. You’ll also be able to set boundaries on any further pressure. And again, if you aren’t sexually compatible before you commit, suddenly having a ring on your finger won’t change that.  Managing expectations in a relationship Everyone has an idea of what a romance or relationship should be like. Such ideas can become absolute expectations. Everyone should expect to feel valued within a relationship, to have fun, to grow in understanding of their partner and themselves, plus to seek solutions together when hurdles arise. But when it comes to getting married, they need to have learned that it’s not simply about love. Commitment is about making they both want the same things from their lives together. Secretly hoping your husband-to-be will change his mind about wanting children once you’re married simply means you’re fooling yourself.

It came just weeks after the birth of Prince Louis on April 23 - prompting many royal fans to believe it was a \u0027push present\u0027 from Prince William .  And it wouldn\u0027t be something out of the ordinary, as the Duke of Cambridge had previously gifted Kate jewellery following the births of Charlotte and George as a token of his appreciation.  He reportedly gave Kate a pair of green tourmaline, green amethyst and diamond earrings, worth around \u0026pound3,000, when Princess Charlotte was born in May 2015.    And it is also thought William gave Kate a circular pendant inscribed with ‘George Alexander Louis’ following the birth of her first child, Prince George .   So many fans were delighted when they saw the citrine ring on Kate\u0027s right hand in May at the royal wedding. She also wore it while at this year\u0027s Wimbledon with a lemon-coloured dress .  However, if William did indeed give Kate a gift following the birth of Louis, it was not the citrine ring as it has now emerged she was seen wearing the same sparkler 10 years ago. Eagled-eyed fans have spotted that Kate wore the ring at the wedding of Lady Rose Windsor and George Gilman in July 2008.  The Duchess of Cambridge was also photographed wearing the sparkler back in January 2008 when she celebrated her 26th birthday. She was snapped leaving Kitts club in Sloane Square with younger sister Pippa Middleton.  Meanwhile, push presents appear to be a tradition within the royal family , Prince Philip reportedly gave the Queen a large bottle of champagne and bouquet of red roses and carnations following the birth of Prince Charles in 1948.  But it was Princess Diana who is said to have been spoiled the most as she was lavished with a range of gifts, including a diamond and pearl necklace that featured a dazzling heart at the centre, a gold ‘W’ to add to her charm bracelet and a custom Mini Cooper.

Jennifer Ashwood gave birth to her one-in-500million twins Poppy and Piran House by c-section just months after discovering she had a rare \u0027heart shaped\u0027 uterus. The 31-year-old said her body has surprised her as there was no indication she had two wombs when she gave birth to her first child Millie, now eight. Doctors told her it was so rare to carry a baby in each one, they didn\u0027t quite know what was going to happen until they opened her up. Remarkably, she became pregnant with twins when one egg was released into each uterus - and they were both successfully fertilised at the same time.  Doctors told Jennifer and partner Andrew House the chances of having twins in this way was one-in-500 million. The family are now all home in Camborne, Cornwall, and getting to grips with their two new members. Jennifer, a care coordinator, said: To have the two uterus\u0027 is rare in itself, but to have an egg in both, then those to be fertilised, and then for both eggs to be in the right part, it\u0027s a bit of a miracle. It is ridiculously rare. The odds were stacked against us but it all worked out. You think that you know your body well, but it turns out you might not. I\u0027m 31. I\u0027ve had a baby before and it was really straight forward. But my body has surprised me this time.  It\u0027s two separate uterine cavities joined by one cervix. Everything else is the same, with two fallopian tubes, one each side, each with an ovary. It\u0027s caused by a mid-line abnormality from when I was in the womb. What happened was at the time of ovulation an egg was released from each tube, one into each uterus, and both were fertilised, and both remained in each uterus. It\u0027s crazy when you think about it. It\u0027s possible that the fertilisation could have occurred one or even two days apart, but it was from the same time. We found out at the 20 week scan and ever since people have been saying how rare it was.  Jennifer and Andrew, a firefighter, found out they were expecting twins in December 2017, at their dating scan, and he proposed on New Years\u0027 Eve. In January 2018 they found out she had a uterine abnormality, and doctors revealed in February she had a complete bicornuate uterus with a baby in each side. A bicornuate womb is heart-shaped and women have no extra difficulties with conception, but there is a slightly higher risk of miscarriage and preterm birth. In most cases women with the condition will only carry one baby in one uterus. Jennifer went into early labour at 28 weeks, but her contractions were stopped with medicine, and she had a c-section on May 6.  Piran was born first at 5lb 10oz, with Poppy born minutes later weighing 5lb 3oz. Doctors even took a photo of Jennifer\u0027s uterus\u0027 during surgery at her request, so she could see what it looked like. It clearly shows the two uterus\u0027 with one measuring much smaller than the other. They had their own uterus, their own amniotic sacks, and their own placentas, she said. They said it was realistically like having two single pregnancies at the same time. It\u0027s hard to compare this pregnancy to my last one. Definitely compared to my first pregnancy I was sick much, much more. Because it\u0027s so rare to carry a baby in each one, they didn\u0027t really quite know what was going to happen until they opened me up and took a look.

After a brief respite from the heat, parts of the country are bracing themselves for another scorching spell as the heatwave is set to return. Weather forecasters have warned that temperatures are likely to hit 30C (86F) across the south of England by Friday, instead of being concentrated in the south east. The mercury will continue to climb over the weekend reaching highs of 32C (89.6F) and possibly 33C (91.4F). While the south shrivels, northern parts of the UK will continue to see showers with temperatures sitting in the mid 20s.  A spokeswoman for the Met Office said: In terms of the weekend just gone, they were the first two days this month where temperatures haven\u0027t reached 25C (77F) but we have got back to that point today, it hit 25.3C (77.5F) in Cavendish in Suffolk so it\u0027s already starting to warm up again. Over the next few days there will be something of a north and south split - high pressure is already starting to build up in the south, bringing dry, fine and weather. She warned: Southern England and Wales are going to turn quite hot by Friday - temperatures will probably reach 30C (86F) by that point. This is likely to include quite a wide area across the southern part of the UK - it will widely hit 30C (86F) across southern England and Wales, and the very hot weather will return as we approach the weekend.  Today (Wednesday) : It will be a bright morning for many with a scattering of showers in north-west England and Scotland. Turning largely cloudy in the afternoon for most with persistent rain in Northern Ireland and western Scotland. A bright and sunny day in East Anglia and the south-east. Moderate southerly winds.

Claire Joanne Wright was found dead at Heron’s Lake Retreat in Caerwys, North Wales on July 16 at 12:50pm. The death of the cafe manager, from Bradford, remains unexplained as police wait for results from her post mortem. At the opening of her inquest at County Hall in Ruthin, coroner John Gittins said he could not give too much information about the 38-year-old’s death due to an ongoing police investigation.  “This death is the subject of an inquiry by North Wales Police,” he said. “Due to the circumstances, I’m not in a position to give a great deal of information regarding the circumstances in how Ms Wright was found deceased.” Mr Gittins opened the inquest but immediately adjourned it, pending the outcome of the police investigation, reports the Daily Post. He added: “I do have a responsibility in law to open my inquest as soon as possible and I’ve had adequate information regarding identification to facilitate that.  “So I now open that inquest but, because there are ongoing police investigations, it’s not clear whether any charges will arise in relation to the death of Ms Wright. “Therefore it’s not appropriate to give a final inquest date at this time. So for the time being, I’m opening and adjourning the inquest.” North Wales Police said they are awaiting the results of tests in regard to the post mortem, which could still take several weeks to come through. A spokesman said: “The results of a HM post mortem examination have proved inconclusive and further tests are being carried out.

Seth Owen, 18, graduated from First Coast High School in Jacksonville, Florida, this year with stellar results and was offered a place at prestigious Georgetown University in Washington DC. The talented student was cut off financially by his parents after leaving home over concerns about his well-being - and as a result was unable to afford the costly tuition fees to go there this autumn. Valedictorian Seth says he was forced by his parents to attend gay conversion therapy for over a year but was finally given an ultimatum: go to church or leave home.  Mr Owen was finally excluded from their lives in January after he refused their demands, citing his issues over their anti-LGBT teachings.  One of his teachers, however, decided to step in and set up a GoFundMe page for her pupil in an effort to help him realise his dream.  Jane Martin, who taught him biology, set an initial target of $20,000 but was amazed when the donations kept flooding in on the crowdfunding platform. I know the goal seems unrealistic and the circumstances aren’t ideal, but I also know communities can make the impossible possible, she wrote. It’s Pride Month and rainbows abound around the world. Help me bring a rainbow in the midst of Seth’s storm.  So far $65,000 (\u0026pound48,000) has been pledged to Seth by contributors who were moved by his plight. Seth was just a kid that really stood out to me,” Martin told NBC News. He was super ambitious and was always trying to go above and beyond to make sure he could be as successful as possible. Grateful Seth has responded the kind help of his benefactors and says dreams have now come true.

Bruce Beach, 83, began constructing the 10,000 sq ft Ark Two shelter in the early 1980s during the height of the Cold War. It\u0027s thought to be the largest nuclear fallout shelter in North America. But he keeps the mammoth shelter running with help from volunteers should the world erupt into nuclear war. The self-confessed \u0027survivalist\u0027 says he fully expects the world to descend into nuclear war and is surprised it hasn\u0027t happened in the decades he has been preparing his mega bunker.  Well, I\u0027ve thought for years this is it. he told the BBC .  They (world leaders) can\u0027t get any worse than this but they do. He has appeared on the 2012 Netflix documentary \u0027Doomsday Preppers\u0027 where he talks through his plans should the world end and how he has prepared for various catastrophic scenarios.  The heavily fortified network of buses, encased in concrete and buried 14 ft below the ground, can accommodate as many as 500 people for up to three weeks - enough time for nuclear fallout to decay to a safe level. According to Bruce, the layers of earth over the shelter complex should be enough to keep people safe from the effects of radiation. The bunker is powered by diesel generators, has two kitchens, full plumbing, a day room, space to store weapons, a decontamination tank, a chapel, a radio communications center and a 5,000 gallon water tank. According to reports Bruce has claimed the shelter could also work as an \u0027underground orphanage\u0027. He has previously reportedly said he would prefer to allow children into the bunker than adults as they are the future of civilisation. The kids quarters can sleep 96 children in two shifts.

The first is my collections of jewellery which I design and make to be distributed to the shops that stock my designs up and down the country.“The second is my bespoke pieces.“This is where someone comes in with a design in mind or with a piece they want to be remodelled.“With my bespoke designs it is much more fun as I can be a bit more creative.“It can be a big responsibility as a lot of the time someone is grieving over the loss of a loved one and they want a piece to remember them by or they want a piece of their loved one’s jewellery reworked.“You can’t change it back, so it can be quite nerve-racking.“I have also incorporated people ashes into designs, so it can be a very emotional journey with my customer.“It is lovely that I can really help customers after the passing of a loved one with a piece that is incredibly sentimental.“The third part is teaching.“I have held workshops since the beginning. I think it makes the pieces more sentimental when someone has made the ring themselves.”After taking the plunge to work on her business full time only a year ago, Scarlett has urged anyone else in the same position to take that leap into self employment.“This business is my life and I love it.

He missed the penalty at Ross County and for this reason he talked to Adam and said ‘you take it’!“Nicky is a player sometimes you don’t see anything from for 90 minutes and then he’s there to score a goal, this is his strength.“His two goals definitely gives us hope for the league ahead.”That was Clark’s second and third goal in his first four games for the Tangerines.With 29 goals in 62 Championship games for previous club Dunfermline, United are hoping he can fire them to promotion this season.Another bright spot for the campaign ahead is youngster Declan Glass. The 18-year-old made his mark in the north, despite only replacing Clark for the final eight minutes.With the final move of the game, Glass jinked past his man on the edge of the area and smashed the goal beyond Kyle Gourlay, the Elgin goalkeeper on loan from Dundee.And Csaba says knocking in four goals sets his side up for next week’s league opener against the Pars.He added: “It was important we scored goals.“In the first half we tried but we had just two or three possibilities but we missed and I think the second half was OK, we used the possibilities to score.“It’s always the same against teams who are in a lower league, they defend very well and stay very deep.“I said in the dressing-room keep your patience, keep going, keep going and be more accurate in front of goal.“It was good, I am really satisfied.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures dundee united take on 100 young arabs at open day","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United players took on 100 young Arabs at Tannadice yesterday with many more fans getting a chance to meet the players.The Tangerines held their annual open day giving supporters the chance to meet the squad aiming to get their side back in to the Premiership."},{"url":null,"title":"proposal to modernise two dundee play parks","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTwo Dundee playparks are in line for improvements.Proposals have been put forward to upgrade the play area at Lochee Park and the Bankmill Road park.Council officers, residents’ group Community Spirit Action Group and West End councillor Fraser Macpherson held a “walkabout” when potential improvements were discussed.Mr Macpherson was told proposals to upgrade Lochee Park will be considered by Dundee City Council’s neighbourhood services committee in the autumn, with the possibility of improving the Bankmill Road park to be considered thereafter.He said: “I am pleased that improvements to the playpark at Lochee Park will be brought forward in the autumn for consideration as it could well do with modernisation and new play equipment.“During the community walkabout we also visited the park in Bankmill Road and it is hoped to upgrade it too.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b472af772e3d.jpg ","title":"thousands of extra visitors since opening of new dundee railway station","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee’s brand new railway station has attracted thousands of extra visitors since opening earlier this month, according to ScotRail.In all, the number of ScotRail passengers travelling to and from Dundee increased by 16% in the period from July 9-29.It’s a rise of approximately 16,000 passengers on the same period last year.While 2018’s passenger numbers have been buoyed by The Open in Carnoustie, railway bosses say it is not the only factor in play.A ScotRail spokesman said the firm believes that a quarter of the additional passengers were visiting Dundee for reasons other than golf – about 4,000 in total.The spokesman added: “There has been a significant boost in customer numbers since the new station opened, which is great news.”The figures do not include those using other railway services such as the Caledonian Sleeper or LNER, formerly Virgin Trains East Coast.

In addition to converting an equestrian centre into a holiday complex, the others are for a farm house, a detached house and an agricultural shed.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"These may herald even more development in turn threatening to form a circle that, if unchecked, would eventually widen, join-up and constrict the core site protected by our charity,\" Mr Skinner said.He also cited the recent approval of a golf course at the Coul Links which falls within the Loch Fleet site of scientific special interest.He questioned whether either designation would still have any meaning if they were going to be run roughshod over by the current planning process.\"Culloden and the Coul Links are just two examples of a worrying trend,\" he said. \"Scotland\u0027 heritage is too often being cast aside for short-term economic gain.\"Four years ago, we argued for a planning framework which has the long-term wellbeing of our heritage sites built into it.

She said: \"Everything for kids is so expensive nowadays, I thought we could have some good old fashioned fun on the beach and bring a few families together.\"The idea was for the kids to have an hour to make their sandcastles, they would all get stickers and we would get someone local to judge the best ones.\"She had thought that parents would simply mind their own children, but Highland Council told her she would have to provide formal first aid cover and explain fully how the event would impact other beach users.As Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes had advertised the event on social media and circulated flyers around the town, she was worried she might have to call the whole thing off: \"I was panicking when I got the email through, thinking I might need to cancel it and the kids were already excited.\"There is too much red tape and so many barriers to get through to run an event, people will end up giving up.\"Unsure of how to save the event, she took to the Nairn Rocks social media page to ask people for advice.And as a result, Fochabers firm Saltaire Security offered their services for free and provided a copy of their own public liability insurance certificate to Highland Council.There were also offers to provide lifeguard cover and Nairn Business Improvement District also came forward to say it would help.In the end, Highland Council agreed to waive permission fees.\"It couldn\u0026rsquot have gone ahead without the security company and everyone else who is helping for free,\" said Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes, who has also been delighted at the offers of prizes from local businesses.Weather permitting, the event will now go ahead on Sunday with registration taking place from 10am at Nairn Links for categories ranging from pre-school through to teenagers and

nothing.Most recently it was suggested that the scaffolding could be down by June after a planning application was lodged to demolish the remaining structure and rebuild.This was scuppered when

A new hotel will play a key role in supporting the local economy\u0027 continued growth.\"Construction work is set to be undertaken by international firm Polcom Developments.Managing director Ross Morrow said: \"The proposed hotel, which will be branded by a well-known international hotel chain, will provide accommodation, meeting and fitness facilities for airport users, overseas visitors and local businesses.\"Polcom Developments has extensive experience in developing airport hotels, having recently been involved in the construction of a 250-bedroom hotel at Luton Airport.\"The firm also recently completed a 160-bedroom Marriott hotel on the Heriot Watt University campus, just a few miles from Edinburgh Airport.A design and access statement submitted to council planners places the hotel within the context of a wider masterplan for the development of the business park which Inverness Chamber of Commerce chief executive Stewart Nicol previously said was \"more slow burn than anybody would want\".It had secured just two tenants between 2011 and last year, before the Co-op also confirmed construction of a new distribution facility there.The site planned for the hotel is currently unoccupied but was previously used for agricultural grazing.Said to be five minutes\u0026rsquo walk from the airport, a new access road will have to be created as part of any development.Inverness economist Tony Mackay previously queried the viability of a hotel at the airport after Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) tendered for a similar development at its Inverness

That’s when I noticed there was a wire hanging out of the casing and I realised he must have had a bit of a shock.“He’s okay now – he was neutered last week and I thought a stitch had burst afterwards

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sun sweat and stunts at the mayds sports day","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 07/07/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) Sports Day Not on the Green kicked off on Friday June 29 to sun and sports.The sun didn’t deter the many athletes filling the fields at Lochgilphead joint campus, with rugby, football and golf just a few of the many activities enjoyed.The annual sporting event celebrated their anniversary 10 years of healthy attitude and fun with a portable skate park set up in the car park and even Wonder Woman stuntman, Dom Kinnaird, demonstrating moves for taking down bad guys.With the help of the Year of Young People National Lottery Fund, the event was organised by MAYDS themselves and featured music and stalls with temporary tattoos, face painting, hot dogs and ice cream, with swimming also held at the MACPool.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

It was difficult to hold the bottom at times, however, we managed to hook into dab, plaice, grey gurnard, haddock and a good haul of thornback rays to bring our species tally for the day to five.All in all a decent day’s fishing given the rough conditions. We returned to harbour a tad battered and soaking wet.Day two was almost as windy as the first day, however the rain kept away which was a bonus.Conditions were still far too rough for fishing the deep so we started off on the soft ground for flats but the spurdogs had other ideas. Everywhere we went \u0026#8211 singles, doubles, trebles \u0026#8211 there was just no getting away from them despite Robbie’s best efforts.I have never seen so many chunky spurs, with the best of the day tipping the scales at 14lbs 8oz.Needless to say a fair number of rigs were wrecked, leads snagged and lost on the rough ground, and quite a few fish dropped. On the plus side there were a few PBs and a couple of new club records set.In between the spur attacks, we picked up a few decent dab, plaice, cod, grey gurnard, red gurnard and coalfish (coalies) to take our species count for the day to eight.Despite the rough and tumble we enjoyed the trip and the opportunity to catch some decent fish. Hopefully the weather will be kinder next year and we’ll get to drop a line out in the deep water marks which hold so many more species.The combined scores over two days:Nikki Thompson 185%***********************It was no surprise to find ourselves fishing in the pouring rain yet again. We don’t seem to have much luck weatherwise, but at least it was relatively calm out of Oban with only the slightest breeze.We headed out on board the ‘Laura Dawn’ in search of fresh bait but despite several drifts the mackerel eluded us.With the big tides, skipper Ronnie suggested we fish the rough ground and reefs for pollack and coalies. The plan was to play around here until the tide eased off enough to drop the anchor.It was pretty desperate though with only a few miniscule whiting to show for our efforts. The incredibly rough ground and fast drift were challenging to say the least and most of us left a fair amount of tackle and lead stuck fast to the seabed.Enough was enough, so we decided to head for deeper water and anchor up even though the tide was still pretty strong, resulting in some horrendous tangles.It proved to be a sensible move from a fishing point of view though, with reasonable sized spurs hooked on the very first drop. More spurs, spotty dogs and a couple of bonus thornbacks were taken throughout the afternoon.It was nip and tuck right to the end with just one fish separating the top three placing.Final scores:\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club is looking for players","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:32 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSort that swing because Tarbert Golf Club is holding its James Mundell Memorial gents open.On Sunday August 5 players will compete at Glenralloch for various gross and net prizes between £20 and £60 and, of course, for the coveted James Mundell Memorial trophy.So book your place for a chance to win.Tee off times are 7.50am to 9.10am, 10.45am to 12.05pm or 1.40pm to 2.50pm.To book, call 01880 820565 and entry fees are £15.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teenie takes the title in myargyll","story":"\t\tSandy NeilUpdated: 31/07/18, 7:36 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA competition capturing #myargyll has been won by Teenie Wilson, an amateur photographer on the Isle of Lismore, who took this stunning image before an evening’s fishing at Port Ramsay, as the sun set over Glensanda quarry in Morvern.The competition, run in in association with Wyvex Media and Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, sought to recognise why you think our region is such a fantastic place to live, work and visit through photography, video and prose.Teenie, who runs the Lismore Post office and shop with her husband David, took up the hobby, which they share, two years ago.‘I love it,’ she said: ‘It gets me out.

Sadly the rally was over for both crews after stage four due to electrical problems and other issues.Donald Bowness battled it out in the usual competitive class two with his Vauxhall Nova with Andrew Blackwood on the notes. Bowness enjoyed the battle with Michael Harbour during a Saturday which saw crews struggle to keep cars cool while specators looked on in glorious sunshine. Rally journalist John Fife was prompted to comment: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s like watching two spoilt weans scrapping over one tube of smarties.\u0026#8217Sunday saw a complete change in the weather and crews continued to battle it out in some very wet and slippy stages. Donald Bowness finished 11th overall and first in class two, followed by Michael Harbour in second. Another local man, Jamie Miller, finished an impressive third in the class on what was his first time out in his new car \u0026#8211 without so much as  a test drive in his the Citroen C2R2 Max.Class one saw Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter battle it out in Innes\u0026#8217 newly built Rover , with another excellent drive from the pair who also finished the rally with a trophy win, coming third in their class.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 3","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 6:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Robin Morton provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features a popular subject \u0026#8211 the Paps of Jura.

staffShare\u0026nbspByGary Fanning10:00, 29 JUL 2018NewsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHealth bosses were this week urging motorists to park ‘appropriately’ after complaints about parking chaos at Ayr Hospital. NHS Ayrshire \u0026amp Arran this week appealed for drivers to help to keep the grounds as safe as possible for patients, visitors and staff. The car parks at University Hospitals Ayr and Crosshouse have designated short and long stay areas which are clearly signposted. The short stay car parks have a time limit of three hours and the long stay car parks are for people who need to park for longer than three hours. When the car parking scheme was first implemented, there was a significant improvement in parking behaviours. However, this has not continued. John Wright, director for corporate support services, said: “Over the past few years we have carried out surveys and audits of the car parks at University Hospitals Ayr and Crosshouse and created more than 400 new spaces across both sites. However, we have now reached the limit of the number of new car parking spaces we can build. We are, therefore, asking for help from members of the public. “We need to make sure that we all play our part in parking appropriately and safely in all of our car parks across all of our sites. This will help traffic to flow better, reduce the risk of accidents and ensure that we comply with health and safety regulations.” Mr Wight is urging motorists to: park only in a designated parking bay and do not park on footpaths, or at road junction He urged drivers notto park in disabled parking spaces if you do not have a blue badge Mr Wright said people can help reduce congestion at car park by travelling to the hospital by public transport or car share. He added: “We know that parking is challenging on our sites, particularly at University Hospitals Ayr and Crosshouse. “However, we are limited to the number of spaces we have and this is why we are urging the public and our staff to help us and to park appropriately. We will also be looking at other ways of reducing the volume of traffic on our sites at particular times of the day.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr HospitalUniversities and CollegesCrosshouseAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"health inspectors found heavily contaminated","story":"NewsHealth inspectors have found “heavily contaminated” equipment in Ayrshire’s maternity theatreProbe uncovered suspected blood contamination at hospitalShare\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson07:00, 31 JUL 2018NewsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHealth inspectors have found “heavily contaminated” equipment in Ayrshire’s maternity theatre. A probe also uncovered suspected blood contamination on the shoes of staff at Crosshouse Hospital. The shock investigation, carried out by Healthcare Improvement Scotland in May, included A and E, the maternity inpatient ward and theatre department, and the medical high dependency unit. Examiners said they “observed good compliance with hand hygiene”. “This included medical, nursing and domestic staff,” they added. But the report said that maternity theatre staff “appeared confused” about infection prevention and control audits, which was raised with senior managers. Concerns were also raised regarding suspected blood found on staff’s shoes and contaminated equipment in the maternity theatre and changing rooms. It comes just 12 months after a government-commissioned report into the “unnecessary” deaths of six babies at the hospital which criticised staff shortages. The latest hygiene report stated: “We were told it is the responsibility of each member of staff to clean these, however, it was recognised this had been difficult to implement with some staff groups. “In the maternity theatres, two positional pieces were heavily contaminated on the inside covers. “This equipment is used to provide support and stability to patients during their procedures. “We were told these were removed immediately and replacements were ordered.” Inspectors said they were aware of “good segregation of domestic and clinical waste”. But their report added: “In the maternity theatres, clinical waste was not stored locked awaiting uplift. “We also identified a similar issue in the wards. This could allow unauthorised access to clinical waste.” Alastair Delaney, from Healthcare Improvement Scotland said: “A good standard of cleaning was found generally and it was noted that considerable improvements have been made to cleanliness of equipment in the emergency department since our last inspection. “However, to improve care, NHS Ayrshire and Arran should ensure theatre departments are maintained so they can be effectively cleaned to provide a safe environment for patients.” Hazel Borland, nurse director for the health board, said: “We fully accept these findings. “The HEI inspection was valuable in helping us identify areas where we need to improve and our staff found the visit to be informative and useful. “We are pleased the inspection team observed that there is a good standard of cleaning and cleanliness generally. “We have an action plan in place to ensure the requirements and recommendations highlighted are addressed and we will ensure we continue to provide high standards of care and hygiene throughout our healthcare settings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnCrosshouse HospitalAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"kilmarnock man who lifelong alcohol","story":"NewsKilmarnock man who has had lifelong alcohol struggle shares heartbreaking story and says: \"I don\u0027t want my grandson seeing me drunk every day\"At his worst Andrew from Kilmarnock could drink a bottle of vodka per day, on top of 10 or 15 pints of beer.Share\u0026nbspByDavid Wren12:25, 27 JUL 2018NewsAndrew has struggled with drink his whole life (picture posed by model)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email“I’ve got a daughter and a grandson, I don’t want them seeing me drunk everyday,” says Andrew, who has struggled with alcohol for most of his adult life. At his worst, the 59-year-old from Kilmarnock – who has asked for his surname to be withheld – could drink a bottle of vodka per day, on top of 10 or 15 pints of beer. His situation was desperate, with the alcohol numbing the pain of crippling mental health issues he has suffered from for years. Andrew spoke out after it was revealed in last week’s Kilmarnock Standard that there were 48 alcohol-related deaths at Crosshouse Hospitalin 2017/18, an increase from 38 in the previous year. Illnesses and injuries related to alcohol which have been treated at the facility have also gone up, with NHS Ayrshire and Arran aiming to tackle the problem.  Andrew said: “I’ve been drinking repeatedly for 25 years. I used to drink a litre of vodka a day and roughly four litres per week. “I’d maybe have 10 or 15 pints of beer a day as well. I sought help from various organisations which didn’t help. “I’ve been struggling with my mental health over the years too. The main reason I’ve been hitting the drink is because of my mental health and I can’t get any help.” His battles with drink and mental health have led Andrew to dark places and he has attempted suicide twice. A chaotic lifestyle where he has had brushes with the law over the years also played a part in his mindset, as well as an incident in his late teens where a gun was put to his head. The terrifying ordeal, Andrew says, “wasted my head” and he continues to have flashbacks. It started off his spiralling issues with anxiety and depression which have plagued his life and repeatedly led him back to alcohol. After one suicide attempt, Andrew said that he was told to quit his vodka habit and did so overnight. But the consequences of going cold turkey led to a mild stroke the following day. Battles with his health have continued over the years, meaning he is now on 17 tablets a day just to help his body function. Andrew doesn’t consider himself an alcoholic, but admits he has struggled with drink for most of his life. He also claims that he’s struggled to access help for his mental health issues. He said: “I’ve been to various organisations and they hunt me. “They take the name and address, say they’ll contact you – then nothing.  “So I go to drink and that solves the mental health problems. “But it actually triggers it. Sometimes it eases me and it’s a bit back to front. “These mental health organisations have no money, no funds and the NHS is in a terrible state. “The only people I can rely on are the Ayrshire Council on Alcohol down in Ayr. “I’m not an alcoholic, I’ve just got a problem with drink. “I don’t like being called an alcoholic, I’m just a normal guy that needs help.” The Ayrshire Council on Alcohol have helped him work on his problem with drink. Although on a long road to recovery, Andrew’s drinking has decreased. But, even though the alcohol counselling helps, he admits he’s desperate to tackle his mental health issues. He said: “I’m down to drinking four days a week now, before I would have been seven. The ACA have helped me, I would recommend them to anybody. “They explain the circumstances and give you a target to achieve over a period. They don’t want you to come off of it straight away. “It maybe goes from seven days to five and so on.” He continued: “In a day I’ll maybe drink 15 pints. That used to be every day but now I’ve cut it down to four. “It’s a lot of beer. It’s very hard to say the effect the alcohol has on me. “My main issue is the mental health, the anxiety and depression, my head’s wasted.” Having been in the habit of drinking every day for so long, Andrew removes himself from the dangers of binging when his days away from alcohol come around.   He goes on day trips across Ayrshire to keep him away from the lure of  the pub, which Andrew admits he would struggle to resist if he was just hanging around Kilmarnock town centre.  Although he lives himself, Andrew says he doesn’t drink in the house and bottles of booze stay untouched in his home. The social aspect of the pub, he says, is the lure for him as he seeks the company it brings. Andrew believes he can quit drink – but admits his mental health constantly brings him back to square one as he looks for a life away from alcohol. He says the ACA is saving his life with their support and he hopes continued work with the organisation can help him to live a healthy life. “At times I was just desperate, thinking ‘why live?’” said Andrew. “But I’ve got a grandson now, a daughter, so it gives me something to look forward to in the future. “Hopefully one day I can come off the drink. “Never say never – it’s my ambition.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrKilmarnockAlcoholCrosshouse"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"mayboles christmas celebrations in jeopardy","story":"NewsMaybole\u0027s Christmas celebrations in jeopardyThe community association organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day.Share\u0026nbspByAyrshire Post11:18, 25 JUL 2018NewsMaybole Christmas lights switch on (Image: David Kiltie)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe town’s Christmas celebrations will be in the ice box this year after a community group agreed to freeze itself for six months. Maybole Community Association will not meet again until January, by which time the festive fun will be over. The group organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day. But members could not form a committee at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). A statement issued after the meeting states: “Following the EGM held by Maybole Community Association on Thursday, July 12, 2018, regrettably no one came forward at the meeting prepared to be an office bearer, knowing that the present committee were standing down. “The decision was therefore made at the meeting for all activities of the association to be frozen and put on hold for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of 12 months and will be reviewed again at that time. “No business will be conducted during that timescale. This decision means that there will be no Christmas lights switch-on and potentially no gala next year.” Outgoing chairperson Senga Mason had been in her role for three years and took over after a similar committee crisis.  She said: “People didn’t come forward for the main committee roles and there’s far greater pressures on people’s time now than there was 40 years ago.” Mrs Mason’s connection to the group, founded in 1975, goes back to 1978. Maybole Gala Days in days gone by featured lorry floats and impressive bunting displays across the High Street. But Mrs Mason pointed out: “Health and safety rules meant the end of using lorries, which in any case are normally needed 24/7 by operators. “Even for simple things like bunting you need permits and a cherry picker to put it up. “Rules are in place for a reason and we have to abide by them.” Community association members are also upset at what they saw as unfair criticisms made on social media following this year’s Maybole Gala Day on June 9. A switch-on ceremony in Maybole can only now be saved if another group of volunteers steps forward. If the community association decides to wind up in January its assets - cash, tables, chairs and gazebos - would be dispersed to other groups in the town.

And reader Brian Cassells snapped this image of the creature from the deep. “I’d never seen anything like it before,” said Brian, who was out walking with wife Julie and their two small pet dogs. “At first I thought it must be part of a fishing net, or some kind of rope from a boat. “But then, looking closer at it, it was more like a giant version of those little bones you see when you open a tin of salmon.” Aircraft mechanic Brian, 55, also noted what looked like the remains of a large fin on the sea monster. The carcass was in the water when he first spotted it. But he got a better look on a return walk, two days later. “It had started to break up a bit,” said Brian. “But I got a chance to pace out a rough measurement on dry land.  “And I reckon it was at least 20 feet long.” The Post passed on Brian’s pictures to Girvan-based David Bova, a retired Marine Scotland scientist. David, 61, said: “The images suggest the remains of a basking shark. “Shark skeletons are cartilage rather than bone, and this looks to be the case here.” David explained that basking sharks tend to be seasonal visitors to the Firth of Clyde, feeding on plankton bloom. The gentle giants can grow to over 30ft long, and weigh several tons. “I haven’t seen one so far this summer,” said David, who is regularly out on the waters around Ailsa Craig. Brian was interested to hear David’s opinion, and agrees with his view that the skeleton was more like cartilage than bone. “We kept Daisy (Bichon Frise) and Millie (Cavachon) well away anyway!” he joked.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Ayr United head to Firhill to take on Partick Thistle today knowing that a win will be enough to top the group and put them into the hat for the knockout stages. The Honest Men beat Morton 3-1 in their first group game before beating Albion 2-0 on Saturday. McCall’s side then hammered Stenhousemuir 5-0 at Somerset Park on Tuesday. And McCall, who will head to his old stomping ground on Saturday, said: “It’s a good game against a team in the same league as us. “They are fancied to be challenging for the league title, so it will be a good gauge for us to see where we are at. “I don’t think the game will have any similarities to the league opener though, but if there is a place up for grabs in the last 16 then we are going to go for it.” The Betfred Cup format has come under scrutiny from a number of players and managers involved in the game.  But McCall has gone against the grain and offered his support for the group stage style. He said: “I think it’s good and I like it. “I like the games that actually mean something, rather than meaningless friendlies which I hate. “With this format it means you only need three pre season friendlies. “And we have done well in the opening couple of games so that momentum will hopefully stick with us going into the league campaign.” Ross Docherty has been back in full training for the past week, with Chris Higgins set to join back up with the squad next week. •The Ayr United open day will take place this Sunday from 12pm. Fans are welcome to join the party at Somerset where they can meet their heroes amidst a whole host of fun events. The players and managers will be there along with a Stagedoor BBQ, Mancini’s ice cream and a kids v adults match to soak in, plus plenty of more fun activities.

Lawyer Ian Gillies pleaded guilty on Cooper’s behalf to a break-in charge against her. He said he was unable to explain her absence from court. The charge admitted by the duo says they broke into the home of a man, then aged 66, in Prestwick’s Adamton Road South, on October 10 last year.  Graham admitted an additional charge of breaking into the home of a 93-old man in Ayr’s Elba Court, also on October 10 last year. This charge states that she stole around \u0026pound400 in cash from the man. The court heard that Graham, formerly of an address in Ayr’s Russell Drive, now lives in Prestwick.

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

faced a real pre-season test against the well-drilled, energetic and highly skilledPollock U19s.The visiting team had enough potential to produce players for the higher echelons of the game in the not too distant future.Coached by our Campbeltown\u0026#8217s Stuart Crossan, the Glasgow side impressed with their quick possession football and a willingness to close space, during a frantic opening quarter of a highly entertaining match, at the wonderfully prepared Kintyre Park.The visitors immediately seized the initiative using the ball effortlessly as they imposed their own brand of football across the full width of the park.The Campbeltown favourites were in no mood to play second fiddle and, after adjusting to Pollock’s enthusiastic start, the Pupils created a number of opportunities as Souden and Barr tested the defence down the flanks.The Pupils midfield and central defence dug deep to rest the initiative from their stubborn opponents, but gradually the pendulum swung as the home side played their way into the match.It was a fascinating encounter between two well-matched sides, a game enjoyed by what was a sizable crowd for a friendly fixture.The partisan home support were soon on song when the mercurial Sary Rhama broke free behind Pollock\u0026#8217s defence, a fleeting glimpse of goal before he was unceremoniously brought down from behind.Taking the penalty kick himself, the Pupil’s striker drove the ball straight down the middle to give the home side a slender advantage with 29 minutes on the clock.The pace was unrelenting, and the visitors were rewarded when the Pupils failed to clear their lines from a corner.In the ensuing play, the ball was skilfully carried to the touchline, before an accurate cutback found the incoming forward who drove the ball home at the second attempt beyond Ferguson.One each at half-time was a fair reflection, with neither side gaining the ascendancy.Both sides made a raft of changes in the second period.Pupils ‘blooded’ seven graduates from the under-16s eleven during the game.Pick of the day was an acrobatic scissors clearance from young Ross Brown,  saving the situation with a last ditch goal line clearance.Shortly after, the home side raced up-field to claim victory with a fine goal from player of the match, Ryan McConnachie.Instrumental in both defence and attack, Ryan controlled the ball expertly in the box, deftly shifted its position, before stroking the ‘leather’ beyond a stranded goalkeeper for a brilliant winning goal.A top drawer finish if there ever was one!Tomorrow Campbeltown Pupils bring top quality opposition to Kintyre Park in the shape of Bridgewater, last season’s Scottish amateur cup semi- finalists.A tough match is in the offing, as Bridgewater  lost narrowly by 1-0 to the brilliant

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":null,"title":"the-rahs-make-waves-across-the-world","story":"  The band, from Prestonpans, released their latest single Survival through their independent platform EH32 Records last week and have been thrilled by the response it has received.

And Prestonpans Labour Club, which Walter was a member of, has also joined in with recent fundraisers, helping it donate more than \u0026pound1,400 to Pancreatic Cancer Scotland.  Mattie Edmond, club steward, handed over a cheque for \u0026pound1,410 to Fiona Brown and Alison Clancy from the charity after they hosted Pancreatic Cancer Scotland following two events on Easter Sunday and a show with the Jersey Beats organised by Pete Barrie with support from the Prestonpans Hearts Supporters Club.

Walter, who lived in Prestonpans with Janet, was just 60 when he died. He had been diagnosed with the disease only 29 days earlier.  Wife Janet has vowed to continue campaigning to raise funds and awareness in her husband\u0026rsquos memory.  She said: \u0026ldquoI cannot thank everyone enough for the support they have given me and my family over the past 18 months.  \u0026ldquoRaising awareness of pancreatic cancer is just as important as the fundraising and I would urge everyone to learn and understand the symptoms of this \u0026lsquosilent cancer\u0026rsquo.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.

He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.

The crew chose East Lothian due to its great surfing beaches and its film charter \u0026ndash an agreement between council departments to work together to accommodate film requests in the East Lothian area wherever possible.  In past years, East Lothian has been the backdrop for films including The Railway Man, starring Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman, and Steven Spielberg\u0027s The BFG.

The announcement comes after another incident at the park saw goalposts broken and scorch marks left on the 3G and 2G pitches.  The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.  Two summers ago the park was hit twice by vandals in two weeks, again during July, with the \u0026lsquopie hut\u0026rsquo broken into and items stolen, as well as damage caused to the pitches and surrounding area.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

It is also imposing an eight-week deadline for operators to resolve complaints with customers.  It follows an open consultation and aim to provide stronger protection for consumers and ensure they are treated fairly by gambling businesses.  The commission said the changes would make it quicker and easier to take action for breaches of consumer law, such as misleading promotions and bonus offers, or unreasonable restrictions on withdrawals of winnings.  Gambling Commission chief executive Neil McArthur said: \u0026ldquoProtecting the interests of consumers is priority for us and needs to be a priority for gambling operators.  \u0026ldquoThese changes will protect consumers from irresponsible advertising and misleading promotions, ensure that consumers can withdraw their money more easily and will mean that consumer complaints are dealt with more swiftly.

The report says devolution has \u0026ldquoarguably qualified Westminster\u0026rsquos sovereignty and changed the balance of powers across the UK.  But it notes: \u0026ldquoWhitehall still operates extensively on the basis of a structure and culture which take little account of the realities of devolution in the UK. This is inimical to the principles of devolution and good governance in the UK.

The report goes on to say there is \u0026ldquoconsiderable ambiguity surrounding the Sewel convention and that the UK Government chose to interpret it in such a way that legislative consent from the Scottish Parliament was deemed unnecessary.  It recommends in future clear statements of circumstances under which legislative consent is not required by the convention should be clearly set out.  The MPs also:  *say England should be better represented in the constitution, warning a failure to do so \u0026ldquorisks a sense of increasing disconnection of the English people from the political system  *express concern about the Government\u0026rsquos attitude towards the post-Brexit UK common frameworks, calling on it to publish a coherent policy  *say current inter-governmental relationship mechanisms are \u0026ldquonot fit for purpose and recommend a fresh structure be established along with a new system for inter-parliamentary scrutiny to hold the governments of the UK to account.  The report calls for a devolution review in the year following Brexit, covering how Whitehall is structured and how it relates to the devolved administrations.  \u0026ldquoThis review, it says, \u0026ldquoshould also consider whether the role of the territorial offices in Whitehall and corresponding Secretaries of State are still necessary and, if they are, whether they might be reformed to promote better relations across Whitehall with the devolved administrations.  Sir Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the committee, said \u0026ldquoLeaving the EU will change the UK\u0026rsquos constitutional arrangements, so it needs a rethink.  \u0026ldquoWe recommend the Government sets out a clear devolution policy for the Union as we leave the EU failure to do this just prolongs misunderstandings, which are the basis for more conflict.  Michael Russell, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Brexit Secretary, said: \u0026ldquoThe EU Withdrawal Act is a power-grab on the Scottish Parliament and this report demonstrates that fundamental change is required within the UK Government to ensure devolution is respected.  He suggested it was astonishing how 20 years on from the establishment of the Scottish Parliament, the committee highlighted how training in Whitehall about how devolution worked was still required.  \u0026ldquoBut more than training is needed, he declared. \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government has already said there needs to be a requirement in law for the Scottish Parliament\u0026rsquos consent before Westminster legislates on devolved issues.  Mr Russell added: \u0026ldquoThere has been little meaningful engagement throughout this process and it is time the UK Government respected the views of the Scottish Parliament and abandoned its pursuit of a hard Brexit.  His SNP colleague, Ronnie Cowan, who sits on the committee, said: \u0026ldquo\u0026lsquoWhat we are witnessing is a blatant Westminster power-grab after twenty years of devolution.  \u0026ldquoIt is the arrogance of the Tories who think they can rip up the devolution settlement and transfer powers to Westminster. The fact that the committee is now questioning whether the Scotland Office and the office of Secretary of State are necessary is a humiliation for David Mundell who has clearly failed to justify his job.  Willie Rennie for the Scottish Liberal Democrats said the report was a \u0026ldquopowerful rebuke to those who think the only way is separation and division.  Saying it was urgent for the committee\u0027s recommendations to be enacted to allow all the governments to work together, he added: \u0026ldquoThe prize will be a UK which has decentralised and devolved power but which can still work as a whole when the issues affect everyone across these islands.  A UK Government spokeswoman said: \"We are committed to securing a deal that works for the entire United Kingdom and have been absolutely clear that when devolved powers are returned from Brussels, the vast majority will go straight to the devolved administrations.  \"For the past year, we have been focused on constructively engaging with the devolved administrations and continue to have regular meetings with them, held at all levels, including the Joint Ministerial Committees and Ministerial Forums.  \"All sides have committed to continuing to work together, including building common frameworks so that UK businesses won\u0027t face a cliff edge on the day we leave the EU.\""},{"url":null,"title":"leith-theatre-could-be-major-music-venue-for-edinburgh-festival-director-says","story":"  Now Leith has become one of the thriving cultural areas in Scotland, boasting venues, its own festivals such as Hidden Door, a vibrant population boasting artists, students and writers, and lauded restaurants and bars.  Leith could also now become a key part of the Edinburgh International Festival in the future, after the box office success of this year\u0027s coming concerts at the once shuttered, but now revived, Leith Theatre.  Fergus Linehan, the artistic director of the EIF, which begins on Friday, revealed several concerts at the historic 1932 venue are sold out, with several others close to that stage in its Light on the Shore programme.  Mr Linehan said that Leith Theatre could, if the Leith Theatre Trust completes its renovations, become the third main musical stage for the EIF, along with the Queen\u0027s Hall, used for chamber music, and the Usher Hall, the historic stage for orchestras and staged operas.  He has been impressed by the public\u0027s response to the concerts, featuring artists such as Mogwai, Lau, Anna Meredith, Django Django and Karine Polwart, among others.  King Creosote, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Mogwai on the 23 August and club night with the actor Alan Cumming have sold out.  However, the venue, out of use from 1988 to 2004, still needs a complete renovation to become a full-time venue.  The venue received \u0026pound1m from the City of Edinburgh Council earlier this year towards the on-going project, which could cost \u0026pound7m in total.  Mr Linehan said: \"Leith is going really, really well.  \"The thing with Leith Theatre is that it\u0027s an expensive building to be in [at the moment], because there are no toilets or power.  \"But it looks great - in a beautiful world, you talk about Queen\u0027s Hall and the Usher Hall, Leith could be the third venue for us.  \"For everything from Bang on a Can and the Kronos Quartet, through to electronic and folk and everything, it really could be that space.\"  He added: \"We\u0027d love to say we have 19 Queen\u0027s Hall Concerts, we\u0027ve got 22 Usher Hall concerts, we\u0027d love to have 19 concerts there as well.  \"It would make an awful lot of sense, it would give shape and boundary and identity to that kind of programming.  \"It would be gorgeous...but it needs the boring work done to become a plug-and-play venue.\"  Mr Linehan added: \"It may be that we are in this year, maybe the work gets done next year and we are in the following year.  \"It will also be the question of when we get up and running, whether it creates its own frisson, and people say \u0027I love this place\u0027, and people feel they have to go there.\"  Jack Hunter, chair of the Leith Theatre Trust, said: \"Our design team, led by Collective Architecture is due to conclude its feasibility and costing study in the autumn of this year which will give us a framework for bringing the main auditorium back into regular use for live music, performance and events in the short term, and the longer term development of the whole complex as a multi-space arts and community venue in line with the Trust\u0026rsquos vision.  \"We look forward to sharing more information on this later this year.  \"Meanwhile we continue to build up our profile and engagement with Leith and Edinburgh\u0026rsquos wider cultural community.\"  Mr Linehan said he was concerned about the effects of Brexit on the EIF, especially a \u0027Hard\u0027 Brexit where the Home Office clamps down on visa applications.  He said: \"A backlog at the Home Office would be the nightmare scenario for all of us, because if you bring in 200 people in an opera company, for example, quite often there is some queries, if that slows down, we are all in big, big trouble.\"  \"We\u0027d all assumed that we were all going to be adult about this and we\u0027d keep going after March and we\u0027d be dealing with this in 2021.  \"But if we\u0027re plunged into chaos after March, again the issue is going to be, if government services are going to overwhelmed, how are we going to go through the administration of that?  \"I can see how it will be a real problem for us.\"  Mr Linehan added: \"If people give us a steer, not just in August, but the UK generally, you are getting into consequences that we never envisaged, even for people who voted Leave.  \"To be honest, the problems we would hit would be terrible....a bumpy road and tough, but not compared to other parts of society, they are nothing next to the guys at a car assembly plant in Sunderland.  \"Even in the arts, the main concern for the art has to be for the wider consequences.  \"Problems getting visas are nothing compared to, say, a whole generation of unemployment.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-in-plea-to-emmanuel-macron-to-back-her-brexit-offer","story":"  The Prime Minister\u0026rsquos dramatic dash on Friday to the French President\u0026rsquos summer retreat at the Fort de Bregancon on a small picturesque island in the Mediterranean comes after Jeremy Hunt warned that the EU27\u0026rsquos intransigence was \u0026ldquoincreasing by the day the chance of a cliff-edge withdrawal.

It followed two complaints that a poster and website for the service, seen in March and featuring the claim that the journey took 30 minutes, were misleading.  Govia Thameslink Railway, trading as Gatwick Express, said a total of 79.1% of scheduled trains between Victoria and Gatwick arrived at their final destination on time between April 30 and May 26.  It listed three unforeseeable exceptions to the planned services \u0026ndash if access was required for engineering work, if there was a failure with infrastructure such as signalling or points, or if there was an unavoidable incident such as a passenger falling ill \u0026ndash and said they were contractually obliged to adjust services for safety reasons such as speed restrictions.  It also argued that it was difficult to mitigate against certain causes of delays such as staff sickness, and said any driver involved in an operational incident had to take a set amount of time off work.  The ASA said consumers would expect Gatwick Express to achieve the stated journey time barring exceptional or unforeseeable circumstances outside their control.  It said: \u0026ldquoWhilst we acknowledged that a proportion of services were delayed due to exceptional or unforeseeable circumstances outside of Gatwick Express\u0026rsquos control, such as track faults, fatalities and power supply failures, we considered that a significant proportion of services were delayed for reasons that were within Gatwick Express\u0026rsquos control.  \u0026ldquoAs such, we concluded that the claims \u0026lsquoNon-stop to Victoria station in half an hour\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoin just 30 minutes\u0026rsquo had not been substantiated and were misleading.  It ruled that the ads must not appear again, adding: \u0026ldquoWe told Gatwick Express to remove the claims \u0026lsquoNon-stop to Victoria station in half an hour\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoin just 30 minutes\u0026rsquo unless they could achieve that journey time in most cases, save for exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances outside of Gatwick Express\u0026rsquos control.  Gatwick Express is part of the Govia Thameslink Railway franchise, which also includes Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern.  The operator has suffered major disruption on certain routes in recent years caused by a number of factors, including industrial disputes, a shortage of drivers, infrastructure failures and the introduction of new timetables on May 20.

The rest were community care grants, which last year totalled \u0026pound23.6m and averaged \u0026pound599.

"},{"url":null,"title":"use water wisely urges council","story":"        Aberdeenshire Council has called on the public to use water wisely as the warm, dry weather continues across the area.                The council says here is increasing pressure on water supplies and forecast rain is not expected to replenish supplies sufficiently.                                                    Aberdeenshire Council and Scottish Water are continuing to provide support to a number of properties experiencing water shortages and are encouraging everyone to use water wisely.                                                    Both agencies are working with the Scottish Government to provide bottled water and tanks to those in the area whose private supply is running dry, at no cost. Council teams are already dealing with requests relating to around 40 water supplies, serving around 60 properties, a number which is expected to increase.        The council has delivered, or householders have collected, 2,500 1.5 litre bottles of water. Fifteen 1,000-litre bowsers have been issued and filled by the council, which will be refilled as required. There are more than 7,500 private water supplies in Aberdeenshire – the highest number in thecountry.Given the limited capacity of the council, priority is being given to elderly, disabled or ill occupiers and householders may have to augment the supplies the council provides with water from other sources. More bowsers are being delivered this week and farmers concerned about their livestock are beingadvised to submit requests direct to Scottish Water.                                                                                                        Significant rainfall over a prolonged period is required to replenish some supplies, but this is not expected in the near future. There are warnings that when rain does fall, private supplies could become contaminated and users should be wary.Users of untreated supplies should ensure they boil water before drinking, cooking and brushing teeth. Those using such supplies may be eligible for grant funding towards treatment – contact the council’s environmental health team for information.Long-term, the council is providing advice on future solutions to improve water security, such as support to help connect to the mains. If that is not possible, improvements to the current source or forming a new supply can be considered and grants may be available for some of this work.Environmental health team manager, Louise Cunningham, said: “Most people will be well aware of how recent weather conditions have been affecting the country, but those with private water supplies in Aberdeenshire are acutely aware of the impact it’s having.                                                                                                        “Clearly we all have to use water wisely at times like this, but around 11,500 properties in Aberdeenshire are served by private water supplies, by far the highest number of any local authority in Scotland, and difficulties for these residents could be pronounced.“We are assisting where we can and would encourage anyone who is having issues with their private supply to get in touch with us, both about short term solutions and thinking about the longer term.“When rain does come, users of private supplies should be aware that following an extended dry period the water will not be absorbed by the ground quickly and has the potential to run over ground for longer, potentially contaminating some supplies.”If you need assistance in relation to water supplies, please contact the council by phoning 01467 539539 (during office hours) or by emailing: environmental@aberdeenshire.gov.uk Some useful advice from Scottish Water is also available online: http://bit.ly/2K1CQ7s                                                                    "},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116798.jpg","title":"Caithness estate with links to royal family to be sold at auction","story":"A CAITHNESS estate with links to the royal family and rock and pop stars is to be sold at auction next month.The Dunnet Head Estate, comprising 1800 acres of land and the House of the Northern Gate, was initially put on the market in February for \u0026pound925,000.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA spokeswoman for Auction House Scotland, which is dealing with the transaction, yesterday described the price reduction as \u0026ldquoone of our biggest ever.She said: \u0026ldquoSince the latest reduction on Friday the amount of interest in the estate has increased tenfold with enquiries coming mostly from the UK.Asked why the estate is being sold, she replied: \u0026ldquoThe current owner has had it for a long time and felt it was time to sell up and move on.The estate includes six lochs, a beach, approved planning for 10 timber lodges and a detached house as well as the 10-bedroom House of the Northern Gate.It was owned by Commander Clare Vyner and his wife Lady Doris Vyner, who was the Queen Mother\u0026rsquos close friend and lady-in-waiting. While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Wednesday 1 Aug 2018 7:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116795.jpg","title":"Mey Highland and Cultural Games to be bigger and better","story":"Event chairman Captain Richard Otley said that the Mey Highland and Cultural Games 2018 will be \u0026ldquobigger and better this year and \u0026ldquowill surely put Caithness on the map.The 2018 event is the first Highland games to include para-athletes\u0026rsquo events. People with physical, vision and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete.\u0026ldquoThis is a golden opportunity for local groups, individuals and businesses to raise awareness to their cause and raise funds from their stalls on the day, he said. \u0026ldquoWe are hoping the event will showcase Caithness in a positive way for tourism, business and the community.Sixty para-athletes will travel from as far afield as America and Australia and all over the UK to take part in the milestone event. The Mey Games will be unique as it welcomes both para and Invictus athletes to compete in traditional Highland track-and-field competitions. This will be the first time that para-athletics has been included within a traditional Highland Games context in Scotland.America\u0026rsquos Alex \u0026ldquoThe Tank Armor, who holds the world record for wheelchair caber-tossing, as well as several top Australian para-athletes will be competing.Last year saw a revamped games event held at John O\u0026rsquoGroats, with Prince Charles \u0026ndash known as the Duke of Rothesay in Scotland \u0026ndash in attendance.The duke \u0026ndash whose late grandmother, the Queen Mother, regularly attended the games during her summer stays at the Castle of Mey \u0026ndash did an impromptu tour of the various marquees on the site to chat with local organisations and vendors.Capt Otley \u0026ndash who is also chairman of the Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch of Royal British Legion Scotland (RBLS) \u0026ndash said that all proceeds from the games will be going towards supporting the veterans and their families within the branch area. There will be in the region of 15 marquees this year, including seven new ones as a result of successful applications to local community benefit funds.\u0026ldquoThe Mey Games is now a major annual event in Caithness, Capt Otley said.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos organised by the Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch of the RBLS who took on the running of the games when visitor numbers were dwindling to as low as just 30. Last year, we had 1500 visitors and this year we hope to welcome between 2500 and 3500 people.\u0026ldquoWe are all volunteers and work hard to ensure the event is a big success. It\u0026rsquos a community event and we want the local community to be part of it. We offer free stalls to local businesses as we want to encourage them to be involved.\u0026ldquoAt the RBLS we provide a lot of veteran support and our ethos is focused on military support and participation inclusion.\u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have so many para-athletes taking part this year from around the globe. A delegation from the RBLS Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch visited Australia in April this year to mark Anzac Day so it\u0026rsquos fitting that we will have a number of Australian para-athletes taking part.\u0026ldquoWe want to make sure each of the para-athletes and everybody at the games has an enjoyable time.He stressed how the games have been \u0026ldquoramped up by comparing the number of marquees this year with the total put up two years ago, only three.\u0026ldquoThere has been a massive amount of work behind the scenes by a dedicated group of members to ensure the games not only takes place but grows to a more sustainable level.The build-up to the Mey Games will get under way with a North Coast 500 cycling challenge that will depart from Wick\u0026rsquos Market Square on July 28 and arrive back in the town on August 3, the day before the games.On the morning of the games, at 9.30am, there will be a rededication ceremony at the grave of General Lord Horne in Wick cemetery. \u0026ldquoWe shall honour Wick\u0026rsquos own hero of the Great War with a colour party and piper in attendance at this short but poignant event, Capt Otley said.Events kicks off at 11am and include Highland dancing competitions, pipe and drum bands, the tug of war, dog show and live music, as well as various exhibitions, local art, crafts and food stalls.The event will take place at John O\u0026rsquoGroats for the third time after travel company Natural Retreats stepped in after the previous games location, close to the Castle of Mey, became waterlogged.Since then the company has continued to provide ongoing complimentary use of the showground.Ewan Kearney, chief operating officer at Natural Retreats, said: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted to support the Mey Games again this year.For more information, visit the Mey Games Facebook page: https://www.facebook/MeyGames/Wednesday 1 Aug 2018 7:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New record set for Lands End to John OGroats cycle run","story":"THE record for cycling from Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats has been broken by Michael Broadwith.The 40-year-old from Hertfordshire did the marathon bike run in 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds \u0026ndash more than 30 minutes faster than the previous record held by Gethin Butler.His record of 44 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds had stood for 17 years.Veteran local cyclist Alasdair Washington was a record-keeper for the Road Records Association (RRA) at the north end of the trip.Mr Broadwith, a maths teacher, joins a select number of people to break the record since George Mills, riding a penny-farthing, made the first successful end-to-end attempt in 1886.Broadwith also broke the RRA 24-hour record with 507.511 miles covered at an average speed of 21.1 miles per hour.Bill Mowat, vice-chairman of the Dunnet and Canisbay Community Council, congratulated Mr Broadwith on his remarkable achievement.The women\u0026rsquos record holder is Lynne Taylor who lives in the West Midlands. \u0026ldquoShe is the only one with a Canisbay parish relative to do so, said Mr Mowat, who pointed out that the RRA only recognised female racers in the late 1930s.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Wednesday 1 Aug 2018 7:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"We just werent at the races says Academy boss after opening day derby defeat","story":"DEJECTED Wick Academy manager Tom McKenna watched his side succumb to a 2-0 derby defeat to Brora Rangers and admitted: \u0026ldquoWe just weren\u0026rsquot at the races.Goals by Kyle Macleod on the stroke of half-time and Craig Campbell just before the hour mark gave Brora a 2-0 win at Dudgeon Park on Saturday in Steven Mackay\u0026rsquos first competitive match as player/manager.Rarely will you see a more one-sided game with a mere two-goal margin of victory, and after the final whistle McKenna admitted his team had been second best throughout.\u0026ldquoWe were lethargic, we were disjointed, there was no fluency in our game, he said.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to take anything away from Brora \u0026ndash they were by far the better team.

Where vacancies are going to occur, boards are already planning their recruitment processes and keeping us updated on the progress. There are absolutely no plans to merge health boards.”Orkney MSP Liam McArthur also spoke out in response to the reports, emphasising the need to consider the repercussions for island health boards.He said: “Patients in Orkney and Shetland rely heavily on these mainland boards, particularly NHS Grampian, for specialist treatment and care. Any proposals to merge NHS Grampian, NHS Highland and NHS Tayside, therefore, must take full account of the impact on island health boards.“Traditionally, rural and island communities have not fared well from the centralisation of services.

The organisation\u0026rsquos chairman, Tony Vandyke, says the money will be used to complete the first stage of an extensive revamp ahead of proposed further work in the next five years.\"We are going to use the money for things like replacing the handrails and changing the electrics and lighting,\" he said. \"These are vital upgrades.

The harbour has been there for 200 hundred years.

A landmark study published in the journal Brain from the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research of Milan and the University of Glasgow provides first evidence that just one traumatic brain injury can generate an abnormal form of the dementia associated protein tau that can slowly spread through the brain, resulting in memory deficits and neuronal damage.            Dr Elisa Zanier, who led the team along with Dr Roberto Chiesa, said: “Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability in young adults.             “Even in milder cases, it represents a risk factor for dementia such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Understanding the mechanism linking an acute mechanical event to a progressive, degenerative brain disease would help development of new therapies.”In Europe, more than five million people live with a physical and/or psychological disability due to moderate or severe traumatic brain injury.The new study identifies tau propagation as a possible mechanism responsible for the long-term disability of traumatic brain injury patients, and suggests blocking tau propagation may have therapeutic effects.Dr Willie Stewart, from the University of Glasgow said the team analysed brain specimens from patients surviving a year or more after a single, severe traumatic brain injury.He added: “We saw evidence of much more widespread deposits of abnormal tau proteins in brain injured patients than in normal control brains.”            In a healthy brain, the tau protein has an important function, acting as a form of ‘scaffolding’ to keeps cells stable. But in Alzheimer’s, tau loses its normal form and breaks away from the cell.Kirsty Yanik, acting head of policy for Alzheimer Scotland, said: “Dementia doesn’t just affect older people. Around 3,000 people in Scotland under the age of 65 have some form of dementia. “It is important that these younger people have access to information, care and supports appropriate to their needs in the communities where they live.“Whilst welcoming this study, we could call for much more research into the causes of dementia, treatments and supports that allow people to live well with dementia, as well as seeking to prevent and even cure the condition.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4776437.1533059718!/image/image.jpg","title":"ayesha hazarika how the male dominated media subverted metoo","story":"        Instead of women coming together to fight the patriarchy, it now looks like we came together to fight each other, writes Ayesha Hazarika                It’s that special time of year when Scotland’s wonderful capital is invaded by eager culture vultures with backpacks, fanny-packs, spreadsheets and an incessant demand for directions.            Joining them in almost equal numbers will be the performers – including many stand-up comics such as myself. We’ll be the less enthusiastic ones with a slightly haunted look who haven’t seen sunlight for a long time as we’ve been working on our shows like pit ponies only for you to ignore our feeble attempt to hand over a flyer.             And previews are tough. Especially when your material is all untested, rambling and you’re performing to eight people in a sweatbox. One preview went so badly a nice elderly lady asked me if was the first time I had ever tried stand up. Everyone’s a bag of nerves right now. Will I remember my show? Will anyone will come and see me? Should I have brought a proper coat? The festival is the place to ponder big questions. Last year it was Brexit and I’m sure there will be much more of the B-word, but one of this year’s big themes is sexual harassment and feminism as a result of the #MeToo campaign. The revelations about Harvey Weinstein, which were the catalyst for the campaign, were shocking. Especially the bit about what he did in the plant pot. Gross. He’s surely the only person to get a life-long ban from Homebase.It was a big moment because, for the first time, it was okay for women of to speak about the sexual harassment or abuse they had encountered over the lives – much of it in the workplace. Before Me Too, you weren’t meant to say what had happened to you. It wasn’t the “done” thing and was seen as vulgar. Obviously grabbing your arse was fine – but workplace etiquette can be odd that way.             Then it all came out thanks to the brave women who had the courage to break that rule and go public. And so the veil of secrecy which had protected these men and given them impunity was lifted. And yes it was mainly men – because men are still mainly in charge in society and so much of this behaviour was not just about sex, it was about power.The #MeToo campaign went viral and it was like this lid had been lifted. Social media exploded with women of all ages, races and walks of life telling their stories and you realised that pretty much every woman had been affected by this kind of behaviour at some point in her life.READ MORE: Ayesha Hazarika: Emotion over reason is the new politicsThen we had Times Up and, of course, Donald Trump – you wait your whole lifetime for a big juicy gender equality campaign, then three come along at the same time.             I was excited. I thought “this is it!” I thought that women of the world would unite to take on the system, but it didn’t quite work that way. Instead of women coming together to fight the patriarchy, it now looks like we came together to fight each other. I was hoping it would be like Made in Dagenham, sadly it seems to have gone a bit Prisoner Cell Block H.Whenever you turn on the television or radio or look at social media, women are always having a go at each other about feminism, which is what I explore in my show Girl on Girl. Whether it’s the gender pay gap or women on boards or up-skirting, the media (which is largely still run by white chaps) loves nothing more than seeing women taking lumps out of each other and shrieking – it’s like porn for the patriarchy, plus it keeps us women in our place and preserves the status quo. I have had some horrendous experiences after being made to debate women which feel more like a freak show or a dog (bitch) fight, than a considered discussion about important issues.             And of course, women don’t have to agree on everything – men certainly don’t. Men are allowed to have really diverse opinions and even if there is disagreement, they are allowed to be authoritative and respected.Their opinion may be challenged, but their right to hold it isn’t – especially by their opponent. There’s a mutual respect. Women, on the other hand, are pitted against each other on often highly sensitive gender-based issues and encouraged to get emotional and personal with each other. READ MORE: Ayesha Hazarika: The real reason Saudi women were allowed to driveI was once asked to have a fight with Esther Rantzen! Are you kidding? How can you have a row with Childline?The #MeToo campaign is important but the job of feminism is far from done and the same issues still endure today that the Suffragettes campaigned on – better pay and conditions, childcare, women’s health, violence against women and, of course, women and power. Some women first got the vote a century ago, but women’s voices are far from being heard and respected in the same way men’s are. So instead of tearing lumps out of each other about whether feminism has gone too far (spoiler – it hasn’t), let’s try and focus on the things that really matter.Ayesha performs her show Girl on Girl at the Gilded Balloon at 6.45pm from 2-11 August"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774013.1532550395!/image/image.jpg","title":"strictly come dancing sensation ed balls on his newest tv show","story":"        Ed Balls is discussing the dos and don\u0026#8217ts of donning a leotard.                No, he’s not referring to his Strictly Come Dancing days (in case you missed it, he was the unexpected star of the 2016 series).            The former politician, 51, actually wears a skimpy Union flag number to enter the wrestling ring in new BBC Two show, Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.            “I’m not someone who previously had bikini line concerns, but they wanted me to wear a really tight-cut leotard, and I thought it would be unflattering,” quips the Norwich-born father-of-three, who’s married to Labour MP Yvette Cooper.“I got a pair of black boxers under it. Had I only worn the bikini line, that might have ruined it for the viewer…”He decided not to shave his legs and torso, like his fellow wrestlers did, either.“My kids think dads should be embarrassing but that I substantially overachieve,” he adds with a grin.“I could explain to my 13-year-old why it was important to do the wrestling, but if I’d have been waxed and shaved, she would have said it was too much.”            The factual entertainment series sees the ex-shadow chancellor walk in the shoes of a variety of supporters of US President Donald Trump, to try and understand why they voted for him.“Lots of people will assume they’re either deluded and don’t understand, or extreme and dangerous, but we just met really nice, ordinary people,” he says.“I thought that after the first year Trump would be losing support, but we didn’t find that at all and it wouldn’t surprise me at all if he won a second term.”The three episodes look at different issues facing Americans, whether that’s the gun control movement or immigration policies, and how they feel about their country since former reality star Trump was elected in 2016.            “I thought he’d drop the wild persona and become a more reasonable, centrist president but he hasn’t at all,” Balls notes.“You assume it can’t get worse, and it does.”As well as being an insightful and entertaining series, what might surprise viewers is how emotional it is to watch at times.In the first episode, Balls stays at a farm with a group of war veterans, and as well as hearing their thoughts on Trump, he joins them round a campfire for a toast to friends who lost their lives in service.And he asks to toast to Labour MP Jo Cox, a mum-of-two who was murdered by a far-right extremist outside her constituency surgery in Birstall, near Leeds, a week before the EU referendum.            “The only thing which felt comparable to me was Jo, who I knew very, very well,” Balls confides of the moving scene. “I did a lot of campaigning and fundraising with her.“From a personal point of view... Jo losing her life is a terrible thing, obviously, but I’m somebody who has three kids, and a partner who does exactly the same kind of surgeries every Friday, so it could absolutely have been us.“I could both think about what it’s like to be Jo but also think about what it’s like to be her family.”Balls agrees that competing on Strictly – on which he won fans over with his memorable salsa to Gangnam Style – showed the public a different side to him.“People kept saying to me, ‘We always knew you were a politician but it’s great to see you’re a human being as well’.”With presenting this documentary series taking him out of his comfort zone once again, he says we can expect to see even more of his personality.“It’s impossible to be in a character for so many hours [of filming] each day, so it’s impossible to conceal who I am.” Did he look to an experienced interviewer like Louis Theroux for inspiration?“I took a decision that I shouldn’t watch anyone else doing this kind of thing until we had made the first episode. I didn’t want to try and be someone else.“If you asked me what the genre is, it’s a mix of old-style, early Louis Theroux meets The Real Marigold Hotel and little bit of Ruby Wax.“I tried to let the characters do the talking. I reveal my opinions to camera but not to the people I’m with.”It was the 2015 general election when Balls lost his seat in the Morley and Outwood constituency, in West Yorkshire.And he doesn’t seem to envy those currently working as an MP.“I’m regretful politics is so chaotic at the moment, and I look back at better times wistfully,” he says.“But if you said to me, ‘You could be in Parliament or you could do this show at the moment’, I’d definitely choose this show.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16?

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed.

It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone. Let’s hope not.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"115 north road lerwick 2 ","story":"OFFERS OVER £320,000\nEnjoying a commanding position and having the living area on the first floor affords this 2 storey house stunning panoramic sea views over Lerwick Harbour.

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

a great way to save money.\nA spokeswoman for Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council this week refuted the claims, saying: There have been no instances lately of bins not being collected other than due to local access issues and these are always followed up the next day.\u0026#160 \nStaff in the Waste team have flexible job roles and are employed where needed across cleansing, waste and recycling centres.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a06.jpg","title":"65378  ","story":"    \nTHE Opening Ceremony for the Atlantic Challenge International Contest of Seamanship has taken place.\nEleven international teams are making Antrim their home for this week\u0027s event. \nTwo hundred young people from USA, Russia, Belgium, Great Britain,\u0026#160 Republic of Ireland,\u0026#160 France, Denmark, Canada and Northern Ireland will compete, live and learn together as part of the Atlantic Challenge. \nSpectators will have a great view from the Lough Shore of the 11 picturesque gigs as they race on Lough Neagh.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05.jpg","title":"65379  ","story":"    \nTHE 2018 MCE Insurance Ulster Grand Prix is less than a month away and anticipation is certainly building. \nFollowing a TT that saw Peter Hickman demolish the outright lap record to win a thrilling Senior TT finale ahead of Dean Harrison, the 7.4011 miles of Dundrod tarmac is the next meeting ground for these road-racing heavyweights. \nPeter, UGP Man of the Meeting in 2017 and now the world\u0027s fastest rider, secured podium finishes in four classes, three of which were as race winner.\nUlster Grand Prix Bike Week runs from August 5-11 and is gearing up to be the perfect climax to the international road-racing season.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a03.jpg","title":"65381  ","story":"    \nA SECTARIAN killer has appeared at Antrim Magistrate\u0027s Court charged with escaping lawful custody.\nStanding handcuffed in the dock, 32-year-old Christopher Kerr spoke only to confirm that he understood the four charges against him.\nIn addition to an offence of escaping lawful custody, Kerr is also accused of three drugs offences.\nThe alleged offences arose after he allegedly ran away from prison officers in Victoria Square shopping centre while out on day release.\nKerr, who is currently serving a life term for the shocking and horrifying sectarian attack which claimed the life of 15-year-old Catholic schoolboy Michael McIlveen, was arrested at Antrim Area Hospital the following day. \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a02f2.jpg","title":"65382  ","story":"    \nA CRUMLIN family has again been hit by tragedy after the sudden death of a teenager, just weeks after his father passed away.\nHenry Turley (14)\u0026#160 fell from a hotel balcony in the beach resort of Playa de Muro on Majorca in the early hours of last Wednesday (July 18).\nSpanish Civil Guard said his mother Claire was holding on to his hand and attempting to save him after he overbalanced on the second floor balcony before he fell at around midnight.\nHenry\u0027s death comes less than seven weeks after his father Stephen, who ran the Ten Storey tattoo parlour in Crumlin, was discovered dead at a friend\u0027s house.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a06f-jpg.jpg","title":"65469  ","story":"    \nWITH last weekend\u0027s downpour bringing Antrim to a standstill, it was no surprise that rain also stopped played at Muckamore Cricket Club!\nAfter weeks of fine weather, normal service was finally resumed with one of the most dramatic downpours in living memory.\nMuckamore Firsts were taking on North Down at the time, but the players soon beat a hasty retreat to the clubhouse when the skies opened.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_894394.jpg--.jpg?1533024971000\n","title":"antrim rose roisin sets her sights on tralee","story":"  \nA PORTGLENONE woman is making her way to the dome as the Antrim Rose for the 59th Rose of Tralee Festival.\n  \nRoisin McCloskey came out triumphant at the heat held in the Le Mon Hotel in at the end of May.\n  \nIn competition with nine others she was announced as the Antrim Rose which there hasn\u0027t been since 2010.\n  \nSpeaking to the Ballymena , she said she is delighted to be going to Tralee and is looking forward to meeting all the other roses.\n  \nI am so excited about the experience.

We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

And just before the youngsters left the nest to take to County Antrim skies, Aidan led a team of birders to ring them. It was a marvellous occasion for all who took part. These participants now share a special bond, a fellowship of the rings not unlike that from the famous trilogy Lord of the Rings itself.\n\nIn April, Aidan was overjoyed to see his first barn owl when, after a three-hour stake-out of the old cottage with Dúlra, one emerged like a ghost from the window and out over the shimmering, moonlit lough. That night one of the most significant barn owl projects was launched – if the birds successfully bred, Aidan determined to ring the chicks, setting in motion a structured, monitored process to analyse the population of one of our most threatened birds, one which was on the verge of extinction in Ireland.\n\n“Now that they have rings, these chicks have become dots on the map of barn owls in the world,” said a proud Aidan. “They are five ambassadors who will contribute to a national scientific study of these birds in Ireland.\n\n“And I want the public to help us. These five birds will leave their nest by next Friday and set out to make lives for themselves. Their territory will be from Hannahstown right out to Lough Neagh. We want people to look out for them. If anyone sees one, we want to know. \n\n“You’ll often see an owl in your headlights, and if you also see a flash of metal on their legs, then it’s one of ours. And we want to know about it especially if you see one of them hurt and in need of help.”\n\nThe team weighed and measured the chicks, discovering that four of them were male. “That’s four new territories for breeding barn owls next year,” Aidan said.\n\nAidan and pals – including Belfast Media Group editor Robin Livingstone – set out to ring the chicks in a slick operation.\n\n“This was all about planning,” said Aidan. “We wanted to keep disturbance to a minimum so we had it all worked out beforehand.\n\n“Everyone knew their job, be it climbing the ladder to the nest, weighing the birds, writing their details in the log book, putting on the rings. And everyone was caring and sensitive of the brood. We only spoke when we had to and were gone as soon as possible.\n\n “Adult owls leave their chicks alone in the nest, so the two parents were sleeping in the chimney pot when we went to the nest in the rafters and they weren’t disturbed at all. Owls could teach us a lot – once the chicks are four weeks old the parents sleep in a different bedroom. They know they’ll not get any peace with the young ‘uns playing and constantly pulling at them because they want the bird equivalent of McDonald’s and Pizza Hut. \n\n“The parents go somewhere else so they can get a good night’s sleep rather than stay with their teenage brood.”\n\nThe chick with Aidan is about 40 days old – owls incubate their eggs as soon as each is laid, unlike garden birds who wait until all the eggs are laid before they incubate to ensure they all hatch together – so the five chicks are all different ages and weights.\n\n“This was pretty special for me,” said Aidan. “Despite a lifetime of birdwatching, I’d never seen a single barn owl until this year. To see five chicks in a single nest is phenomenal. This is one of the biggest broods ever recorded, and shows that the birds here are healthy and finding plenty of food.”\nThe old abandoned cottage is on land belonging to the owner of Randox Laboratories Dr Peter Fitzgerald, who is said to be delighted that barn owls have chosen to nest there and is backing the study of the chicks.\n\nAidan added: “There may be only a couple of pair of breeding barn owls in the whole north of Ireland, so these chicks are precious and represent hope that they can make a comeback. A big congratulations is due to everyone concerned.”\n\n* If you’ve seen anything interesting or have any nature questions, you can text Dúlra on 07801 414804.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Generation-identity.png","title":"fascist graffiti re emerges in north belfast","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\nA SINN Féin councillor has stressed the importance of challenging the far-right after the appearance of graffiti promoting a new fascist group in North Belfast.\nLogos representing the white supremacist Generation Identity movement were daubed on street furniture on the Cavehill Road, but were quickly removed due to the fast actions of Cllr Mary Ellen Campbell and maintenance workers from the Belfast City Council.\nGeneration Identity describe themselves as a “movement aimed at preserving the ethnocultural identity of Europe”, and are active in 13 countries across Europe and North America.\nThe shadowy group has been trying to gain a foothold in the North and have already been involved in a number of public demonstrations.\nLast month they were part of the “Free Tommy Robinson” rally at City Hall where demonstrators were pictured giving Nazi salutes.\nSpeaking to the North Belfast News, Cllr Campbell said that fascist graffiti has become a more common occurrence in recent times.\n“It’s about the fourth or fifth time I have had to get this type of graffiti removed in the area,” she said.\n“We need to keep challenging them to prevent them gaining a foothold.\n“More and more people are questioning what it is because they started putting their logo up. If you look at their logo it isn’t immediately recognisable, it’s not a swastika, but people need to be looking at it as such.\n“North Belfast is a very culturally diverse area and we don’t want anybody with that negative agenda organising here.\n“We can see what they are doing outside City Hall and we can see what they are doing in other countries. North Belfast is a welcoming area and that’s the positivity that we want to promote.\n“Thankfully the Council removed the graffiti almost immediately after I reported it.\n“The people of this area have been very welcoming to families that are here from Syria and other countries. We’re a diverse part of the city and that’s the part of the city that I want to live in and promote.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"name change opposed by belfast celtic society","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nPLANS\n for Sport and Leisure Swifts to change their name to Belfast Celtic suffered a setback yesterday with the news that the Belfast Celtic Society has voiced their opposition to the move. \n\nThe Glen Road Heights outfit announced its intentions to change their name in a statement issued on social media earlier this month, with the aim of “improving the club and improving the footballing prospects for young people in West Belfast”. \n\nHowever, despite approaching the society prior to making their announcement, Sport and Leisure’s plans have been met with opposition from the Belfast Celtic Society. \n\nHaving distanced themselves from the name change in a previous statement, primarily due to their status as a charitable organisation, the Belfast Celtic Society held a full committee meeting yesterday morning (Wednesday) to discuss the matter. \n\n“The Belfast Celtic Society again reiterates that it had no involvement in this venture,” a spokesperson said. “The Society was only made aware of the development 48 hours before the public announcement. \n\n“The Society was surprised by this announcement and the reaction received from both our membership as well as the general sporting public has been overwhelmingly negative. \n\n“Since its foundation almost two decades ago, the Society has been approached on more than one occasion to endorse and support a range of commercial enterprises with the intention of exploiting the name of the club for commercial gain. \n\n“Over this period, our standard response has been that this is contrary to the constitution of the society which is regulated by the Charity Commission.” \n\nThe Society also expressed its concern that the families of the former players of Belfast Celtic were not consulted prior to the announcement. \n\nThe Belfast Celtic Society also claim that the trademark registered by businessman Anthony John Bonnar earlier this year is a new company and is not linked to the old Belfast Celtic Football and Athletic Company. \n\nHowever, speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sport and Leisure chairman Jim Gillen said that while he was disappointed the Belfast Celtic Society hadn’t supported the name change, he stressed that the club will be moving forward with their plans regardless. \n\n“We have everything in place. As of yet, the IFA (Irish Football Association) has yet to rubber-stamp it,” said Gillen. \n\n“We have to go ahead with it. We informed them (the Belfast Celtic Society) and we spoke to a few members. They seemed to think it was a good idea.

Grammar schools dominated the top of the league tables for GCSE results achieved in 2017, taking the top 54 places.\n\n\n\n\nRevealed: Budgets for every Northern Ireland school 2018-19\n\n\n\n\nThe Belfast \u0027s league tables include data on every secondary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe top non-grammar school at GCSE in 2016/17 was St Patrick\u0027s High School, Keady (91.3%), followed by St Colm\u0027s High School in Draperstown (87.7%), and St Patrick\u0027s College, Maghera (85.9%) - just ahead of the top performing controlled non-grammar, Castlederg High School (83.3%).Overall across Northern Ireland in 2016/17, some 70.3% of year 12 pupils achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C (or equivalent) including English and maths.\n\nThis was up 2.4 percentage points from 2015/16.\n\nPeter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar, described its joint topping of the latest league tables as a surprise 85th birthday present for the Co Down school.\n\n\"I am delighted with the phenomenal achievement of our Assumption girls at both GCSE level and A2 level,\" he said.\n\n\"The girls and the staff of Assumption have worked so hard and fully deserve this public recognition of our academic success.\n\n\"However, it is the school\u0027s \u0027Fully Alive\u0027 ethos which underpins every aspect of why Assumption Grammar is such a unique educational establishment and has been since we were first established by the Missionary Sisters of the Assumption 85 years ago this year.\n\n\"This is a surprise birthday present which will bring a smile to all our Assumption girls, past and present.\"\n\nDown High principal Maud Perry said the school was very proud of its results and she paid tribute to the hard work of pupils.\n\n\"We celebrate the many talents and achievements of all our pupils at Down High and we\u0027re very proud of the 100% pass rate at GCSE in both mathematics and English,\" she said.\n\n\"Our motto \u0027nothing is achieved without effort\u0027 reflects our belief that there is no limit to what can be accomplished through hard work.\n\n\"This hard work of staff and pupils, alongside the support of our parents, produced these fantastic results in the 2017 summer exam season.\"\n\nToday\u0027s tables also represent a triumph for south Belfast grammar school Wellington College, which scored 94.7%, significantly above the Northern Ireland average, as it works to be removed from formal intervention.\n\nPrincipal David Castles said: \"We are very proud of the excellent GCSE outcomes our students have attained. This significant improvement is part of our drive at Wellington College to raise standards, engage students and build pathways to success.\n\n\"Excellence in exams is a result of students, staff and parents working together, and these GCSE results give a great foundation for success at A-level and beyond.\"\n\nHow we did sums for the latest league tables\n\nThe Belfast  is the only source of comprehensive league tables showing the results of every post-primary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nWe obtained the data from the Department of Education for A-level and GCSE examinations sat in the 2016/17 academic year and compiled the figures into easy-to-read league tables, ordered from top to bottom. In the GCSE league tables, the Belfast  has used the percentage of pupils in the final year of a level 3 course who achieved five or more GCSEs - including English and Maths -between an A* to C grade in each school as the standard measure.\n\nThe Department of Education does not produce A-level or GCSE league tables and said it does not endorse them.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed transfer test grade intake for northern ireland schools","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

In the 2016/17 academic year 11,570 applications were made for the 8,743 available places at our 63 selective grammars.\n\n\n\n\nNI Transfer Tests: 2017 Grammar Schools’ intake and grade information\n\n\nThis is out of a total of 21,763 pupils who obtained Year 8 places at Northern Ireland\u0027s 199 post-primary schools in September 2017.\n\nToday the Belfast  can reveal what grades or scores it took to get into each of our selective grammars last year.\n\nThis exclusive data was obtained over several months by sending Freedom of Information Act requests to each of the selective grammars.\n\nCurrently there are no official figures provided by the Department of Education, because both the Post Primary Transfer Consortium\u0027s GL assessment and the Association of Quality Education\u0027s (AQE) Common Entrance Assessment are unofficial tests.\n\nOur data for tests sat in the 2016/17 academic year reveal:\n\n\nFive schools which use the AQE system did not accept a score below 100 in September 2017.\n\nFive schools which use the GL system did not accept a grade below an A in September 2017.\n\n30 schools accepted AQE scores, while 26 accepted GL scores, and seven took either.\n\nLagan College, which is partially selective, was the most popular first choice by far, with 456 applications for 200 places.\n\nFriends School Lisburn was one of the toughest schools to get into last September - the lowest score it accepted was 106 (AQE).\n\nThree of the 63 selective grammar schools were not oversubscribed.\n\nThe AQE and GL tests received a total number of 14,491 entries in the 2016/17 academic year - 7,725 sat the AQEs and 6,766 sat the GL tests. An unknown number of pupils sat both tests.\n\nThere are 199 post-primary schools in Northern Ireland, of which 63 are grammars that use academic selection for all or some of their Year 8 intake.\n\n\nLeaders in the AQE and GL organisations told the Belfast  that their entry rates have been steadily increasing over the last decade following the abolition of the old Department of Education-administered 11-plus by former Education Minister Caitriona Ruane in 2008.\n\nAQE chief executive Stephen Connolly said the number of entrants to the test is continuing to rise, with 8,169 pupils registered for the 2017 AQE tests, a rise of almost 6% on 2016 (7,725).\n\nMr Connolly said he can only speculate on the increase, but said he believed it may partly follow a decision by former Education Minister Peter Weir to allow primary schools to prepare pupils to sit transfer tests. That reversed a ruling by his predecessor John O\u0027Dowd, which saw schools receive warning letters from the department over preparing pupils for tests within school hours.\n\n\"That reflects a number of things, that is the steadily increasing primary school age population, also a backwash from the former minister taking the shackles off primary schools and allowing them to openly prepare pupils for transfer tests, and also word of mouth from parent to parent,\" he said. There was also an increase in the number of pupils who sat the PPTC\u0027s GL test, from 6,766 in the 2016/17 academic year to 7,150 in 2017/18.\n\nCarol McCann from the PPTC said parents remained very supportive of the tests.\n\n\"More than 30 schools use the GL test and it is used by a variety of types of school, including grammar and bilateral,\" she said.\n\n\"A number of PPTC schools also register pupils for the AQE test. Regarding the increase in the number of pupils sitting the test in 2017 for entry to post-primary in 2018, it is most likely as a result of a rising primary school population in a number of areas.\n\n\"It is very evident that the transfer test continues to be supported by parents in Northern Ireland who believe in educational choice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, talks between the two transfer test providers to create a single system of assessment remain \"ongoing and positive\".\n\nThe AQE and PPTC aim to have a common test in place by November 2019. Mr Connolly said that talks are continuing but the end goal is very complex, and they want to ensure any new single system is robust, will have the confidence of parents, and is of an international standard.\n\n\"The two negotiating teams made a very good decision at the outset to keep it confidential to not raise expectation or increase pressures and making sure the goodwill between us in this difficult process is maintained,\" he said. \"Trying to put together a single system is very difficult.\n\n\"I think it is very important that both groups think it is a matter of principle there should be one system.\n\n\"That principle has been agreed, but getting there is tricky simply because of the complexity of the two systems. People need to have confidence in schools, but also in the testing system.\n\n\"It needs to be reliable, robust and meet international standards. It isn\u0027t just a race to cobble together any old compromise, we are engaging in careful negotiation.\" Results for both tests are due to be released to pupils this Saturday.\n\nHow the figures are compiled\n\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) legislation we asked the grammar schools in Northern Ireland which use academic selection to determine their Year 8 intake to provide the breakdown of the AQE/GL grades/scores achieved by the pupils they admitted in September 2017.\n\nThe data gives schools’ name, location, the highest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted and the lowest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted.\n\nOther information included is the number of first preference choices it received and total applications (which includes first, second, third choices etc).\n\nSeveral schools have provided bands for the lowest and highest scores they accepted, as this is the method they used to select pupils. Some schools accept both AQE and GL scores.\n\nNot all schools use academic selection to determine their entire intake. Wallace High School in Lisburn admits around 90% of its Year 8 intake on test results Campbell College in Belfast admits 70%, while Lagan College in Belfast and Slemish College in Ballymena select 35% of their pupils using test scores. Some other schools also use additional criteria to separate students with the same score vying for the final places. Two voluntary grammar schools, Loreto College in Coleraine and St Patrick’s Grammar in Armagh, no longer use academic selection.\n\nTotal pupil figures do not tally for a number of reasons, which can include pupils with a statement of special educational needs not being included in enrolment figures, and some pupils being accepted through special circumstances or on appeal.\n\nIn some schools pupils were admitted without using academic selection and some schools were undersubscribed.\n\nWhen comparing schools, the size should be taken into account. For example Glenlola Collegiate in Bangor has an annual Year 8 intake of 157 pupils. Its principal Mr W E Thompson pointed out that the 157th pupil they accepted in September 2017 scored 85 in the AQE test, but in the North Down area there are smaller selective grammars which accepted only 100 pupils.\n\nHe has asked us to point out that the 100th pupil Glenlola accepted scored 98 in the AQE tests.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast trust spent 600k on consultants in","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

health bosses paid out more than £600,000 for advice from management consultants in just two years, it has emerged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nAccording to official figures, the Belfast Health Trust paid £7,100 to a private management consultant for 15 days of support in relation to the damning hyponatraemia report.\n\nMeanwhile, it has also tasked another private management consultant to help with work around the ongoing recall of more than 3,000 neurology patients in the Belfast Trust.\n\nThe work is expected to take 30 days to complete, at a cost of £15,000.\n\nThe information has been released by the Business Services Organisation (BSO), which revealed that the HSC Leadership Centre (HSCLC) provided consultancy services to the Belfast Trust at a cost of £630,701 between 2016 and 2018.\n\nIt comes as the health service in Northern Ireland faces unprecedented financial pressures.\n\nHealth trusts are becoming increasingly reliant on cash injections from the likes of in-year monitoring rounds and the DUP-Conservative confidence and supply deal just to make ends meet.\n\nIn January, the Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA) released a report warning that Northern Ireland\u0027s health service could have a funding gap of up to £540m a year.\n\nHowever, the figures released by the BSO reveal that while thousands of patients spend up to five years waiting in agony for operations for painful and debilitating conditions, the HSCLC is paying private consultants £500 a day for their services.\n\nAlliance MLA, Paula Bradshaw, said she was surprised and concerned to learn the private consultants had been engaged at such a cost to the public purse.\n\nShe continued: \"In my opinion, the role of the health service is to support patients and their carers at times when health needs arise and the funding that is allocated to the Department of Health for the provision of care and treatment to meet these needs is finite and in fierce demand right across the sector, and so I will be following this up to find out why the consultants were engaged.\n\n\"Having supported a number of individuals and families affected by the neurology recall process and the Hyponatraemia Inquiry, I am particularly curious to learn more about the nature of this commissioned work and sincerely hope that it is not for the purpose of crisis management.\"\n\nThe HSCLC, which comes under the BSO, provides a range of services to health and social care organisations in Northern Ireland, including consultancy services.\n\nThese include leadership development programmes, support for improvement, team development and other support, including investigations.\n\nThe HSCLC currently has a pool of about 90 private consultants, known as associate consultants, that can be drawn upon as and when required.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Belfast Trust said it has used the resources of the HSCLC for two specific pieces of work \"through normal business arrangements\".\n\nShe continued: \"Firstly, to provide additional support to the trust in the implementation of the 96 recommendations of the findings of the inquiry into hyponatraemia-related deaths which was published on January 31 this year and which are actively being addressed within the trust and as part of the departmental framework.\n\n\"Secondly, in preparation for the independent inquiry panel as a result of the recall of neurology patients, we have secured additional assistance to support us in providing the inquiry with all relevant, extensive, and detailed documentation in a timely way.\"\n\nThe Belfast Trust was criticised by the chair of the Hyponatraemia Report, John O\u0027Hara, in his report which was published in January.\n\nThe inquiry, which examined the deaths of five children, found that four of the deaths were avoidable.\n\nMeanwhile, work is ongoing to identify whether any patients seen by consultant neurologist, Michael Watt, have come to any harm.\n\nThe Belfast Trust has been forced to find additional resources to hold clinics to see more than 3,500 patients and ensure they are receiving the best treatment possible.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dup tries to block northern ireland council flying pride flag","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

However, no meeting is scheduled before Saturday\u0027s parade. Calls have now been made for a special meeting of the council on Friday. If that does not happen, then the flags will not fly.\n\nThe \u0027call-in\u0027 move comes after a notice of motion brought by Sinn Fein on flying the flags narrowly passed 12-11 at a full council meeting last Monday evening. DUP councillors voted against the motion while the Ulster Unionists abstained after their amendment recommending that council buildings be lit in the pride colours instead was rejected.\n\nA council spokesperson confirmed the \u0027call in\u0027 had been received.\n\nSinn Fein group leader on the council Darren McNally slammed the DUP for trying to prevent the flying of the Rainbow flag.\n\n\"The move by the DUP to call-in Sinn Fein\u0027s motion to fly the rainbow flag at civic buildings across the area is disgraceful and disrespectful to our LGBTQ+ community,\" he said. \"This call-in came in the final hour - and is an effort to run down the clock on gaining legal advice and securing a special meeting of the council before Saturday.\"\n\nMayor of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Julie Flaherty confirmed: \"The call-in was received on Tuesday morning and it\u0027s now in the hands of the Chief Executive. That\u0027s where we\u0027re at as things stand.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate development, Barnardo\u0027s has become the first children\u0027s charity in Northern Ireland to publicly voice support for the recognition of same-sex marriage.\n\nIt made the announcement to coincide with Belfast Pride\u0027s Coming Out for Change campaign, and just days before the city\u0027s Pride parade.\n\nBarnardo\u0027s has in the past supported marriage equality campaigns in other areas of the UK and in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe director of Barnardo\u0027s NI Lynda Wilson said it hoped to see marriage equality extended to Northern Ireland.\n\n\"We are committed to providing equality of opportunity and believe marriage equality is an extension of that,\" she said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"little appetite on streets of maiden city for unity referendum","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But if there is one, he doesn\u0027t think people would vote for a united Ireland.\n\nHe said: \"When Brexit is over and we see what damage has been done, that\u0027s the time for a border poll.\n\n\"Whatever Mary Lou McDonald or any politician says, I don\u0027t listen because I am fed up listening to them\n\n\"The fact that they are all sitting up in Stormont and doing nothing while I have worked my whole life has made me switch off the TV the minute politics is mentioned.\n\n\"We will see what happens with a border poll, but the people here are so entrenched \n\n\"I don\u0027t see there being a poll anytime soon, and if there was I think people would vote to stay in the UK.\n\n\"I am saying that as a nationalist and an Irishman. I would vote to remove the border but I think there are too many middle class people too comfortable with the benefits they get.\"\n\nGavin Hutchinson also thinks the timing is not right.\n\nHe said: \"I agree that now wouldn\u0027t be a good time for a border poll because everything is so unclear about Brexit.\n\n\"It would be chaos on top of chaos. People voted for Brexit but they were ill-informed and actually, here, we didn\u0027t vote for it but we will be the people affected by it the most.\"\n\nHe added: \"If it\u0027s just a poll for the sake of a poll, that\u0027s going to drag up the same old rubbish as before, then what\u0027s the point?\"\n\nAt the age of 71, Kathleen Edwards has never voted in any election or referendum, and has no intention of voting in a border poll if and when one is held.\n\nShe explained: \"I never listen to the news, I don\u0027t follow politics and if there was a border poll I wouldn\u0027t vote because it doesn\u0027t bother me if we stay in the United Kingdom or if we are part of the Irish Republic. I have never voted in my life, I don\u0027t believe in it because not one politician does anything for you.\n\n\"They are all getting their big wages at the minute and what are the people of Northern Ireland getting? Damn all.\"\n\nOne man who felt very strongly that there should be no border poll is Jackie Hiscox.\n\nHe said: \"She is calling for a border poll then she isn\u0027t and now she is again.\n\n\"But I don\u0027t think there should be one at all.\"\n\nMargaret Wilkie lives in Ballybofey, over the border.\n\nShe said: \"Mary Lou McDonald will say and do anything she thinks will work best for her and she is saying one thing then she is saying the opposite.\n\n\"But, to be honest, among the people I am from there\u0027s no talk about a border poll and far less interest in it.\"\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37173467.ece/87766/AUTOCROP/w620h342/u_McDonald_RTE_NEWS.jpg","title":"mcdonald uturn over border poll prompts derision from unionists","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The Sinn Fein president has performed a sharp handbrake turn on the comments she made on Monday.\n\n“She initially stated that a poll on Irish unity should not be held while uncertainty around Brexit remains, yet by Tuesday morning the Sinn Fein Press office published a completely contradictory statement, where she was quoted as saying that she wants a referendum as soon as possible.”\n\nMr Aiken said Sinn Fein didn’t have plans for a border poll nor a case to make. “Rather than be distracted by this, they would be better concentrating their efforts on getting devolution restored and addressing the chronic pressures on our health service, schools and other sectors,” he added.\n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster also noted that Sinn Fein had changed its stance overnight.\n\n“Whilst there have been plenty of republican soundbites about a border poll, one interview exposed that Sinn Fein has no answers to basic questions about a united Ireland, such as what happens to our free-at-point-of-need health system,” she said.\n\n“Indeed, within 24 hours of that interview, the Sinn Fein leadership is rowing back from their ‘not yet’ position. As tempting as calling Sinn Fein’s bluff might be, the principle of consent is in place and should be respected. \n\n“Few dispute there is a clear majority in favour of staying within the United Kingdom, but it would be foolish to think that families across the country are itching for a destabilising border poll.”\n\nThe DUP leader said people here were more interested in seeing power-sharing restored than participating in a referendum on reunification.\n\n“The people I speak with want a functioning government today, where decisions about public sector pay as well as roads, schools and hospitals are made,” she said.\n\n“Sinn Fein is the only party blocking that. I have no objection to extolling the merits of the Union. I have done so and will continue to do so. \n\n“Unionism needs to be open and welcoming. Ultimately, if people are comfortable living, working and raising their families in a Northern Ireland within the UK, they will be less inclined to ever vote to leave it.”\n\nTUV leader Jim Allister said contradictions in Sinn Fein’s position weren’t new. “They claim to support peace while continuing to justify the IRA’s terrorist campaign,” he said.\n\n“This is just more of the same practice and is a recognition that their pipe dream of Irish unity is getting no closer.”\n\nAlliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said: “Brexit poses a massive threat to the cohesion of Northern Ireland and the shared society underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement. \n\n“While Alliance respects everyone’s constitutional aspiration, the priority today must be to agree a special deal for Northern Ireland to mitigate the risks from Brexit and to achieve the maximum cross-community support for such a pragmatic way forward.”\n\nWhat Sinn Fein president said in Belfast on Monday\n\nThe obvious thing would be to say ‘well, have the border poll and remove the border, if the border is the problem, simply take it away’ — and there is a certain logic to that.\n\nI am very, very conscious that you can’t come at this issue in that simplistic way.\n\nIt’s very important when we come to addressing the issue of partition we do it in the best possible climate and we do it in a way that maximises consent. \n\nIt is not my preferred option or our preferred option that we deal with the issue of Irish unity in a climate that is unsteady or unstable or chaotic, in other words in the context of a crash Brexit or a very hard Brexit.\n\nI would prefer, it is my strong preference, that we have sequencing that firstly delivers a level of economic and social certainty, in as much we can be certain, and stability and from that base we then continue the conversation about Irish unity.”\n\n... and outside Leinster House yesterday\n\nThe very nature of Brexit and the blatant disregard shown to Ireland by the Tory government underscores the imperative for Irish Unity. It emphasises the need for the people, north and south, to have their say on the constitutional question and the future of this island.\n\nA decision to exit the European Union was endorsed in England and Wales. It was rejected by the people of the North of Ireland and yet, it is to be imposed on them as though they didn’t vote at all. This again highlights the democratic deficit of the union and the utter failure of partition. Clearly, the chaos and prospect of a crash Tory Brexit, and the very real difficulties this will create in the lives of ordinary people, does not provide the best environment for a referendum on Irish Unity.\n\nWe want to have that campaign in an atmosphere of calm, respect and in a climate conducive to constructive debate and not in the shadow of Tory game-playing. However, and I have already put this to Theresa May, if the Tories continue to pursue a negotiation stance that can only led to a crash Brexit, the British Government will have to put the question on Irish Unity to the people in a referendum.\n\nIrish Unity makes sense. It has always made sense. Brexit is simply the latest political mess to underline that fact. The appetite for the Unity debate is growing every day. Sinn Fein wants to see a referendum as soon as possible. We want to build maximum consensus for unity and win that referendum.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"no evidence to back dup poots complaint of being harassed by bbc reporter","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

police investigation has uncovered no evidence to support an allegation of harassment made by a DUP councillor against a BBC journalist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nLuke Poots, son of DUP MLA Edwin Poots, lodged an official complaint with the PSNI last month following a BBC report that raised questions over a planning application relating to land he owns on the Comber Road in Hillsborough.\n\nThe story by Kevin Magee reported the application was not made by Luke Poots, but by his mother Glynis Poots, under her maiden name of Rachel M Gracey.\n\nIf successful, it would have increased the value of the land as it would have replaced Luke Poots\u0027 home with three properties.\n\nMr Poots, a former chairman of Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council\u0027s planning committee, strongly refuted any alleged suggestion of wrongdoing in a statement issued in response to the report last month.\n\nHe stressed at the time that \"all relevant declarations were made\" regarding the planning application.\n\n\"The postal address given in the application is the planning agent\u0027s address,\" Mr Poots had explained. \n\n\"The reason my mother\u0027s maiden name was used was to ensure the application was dealt with fairly.\n\n\"The \u0027Poots\u0027 name is associated with unionist politics. \n\n\"This was an attempt to have the application considered on its merits rather than through a political prism.\"\n\nFollowing a three-week investigation, the PSNI said yesterday that all enquiries had been concluded.\n\nIt added: \"Police received a report on Thursday, July 5 relating to information that had been published online. \n\n\"No criminal offences have been identified.\"\n\nIt was also confirmed that Mr Magee was not interviewed as part of the police investigation.\n\nA BBC spokesman said that it noted the statement from the police. \"The story was a matter of public interest and was reported in accordance with our editorial guidelines,\" he said.\n\nMr Magee has not commented on the outcome of the police investigation.\n\nHowever, he did tweet a link to a BBC NI story on the PSNI\u0027s statement on his Twitter page yesterday.\n\nHe also retweeted a comment posted by Adam Smyth, the head of BBC News NI, who said the original story was legitimate. \"There was never any basis to Luke Poots\u0027 claim,\" Mr Smyth wrote.\n\n\"Our story was legitimate and in the public interest and our programmes remain open to Luke Poots to answer the reasonable questions raised by (Mr Magee) during his investigation.\"\n\nThe DUP was contacted for a response. \n\nHowever, it declined to comment on the matter.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest travel updates","story":"\n

He admitted uncertainty around Brexit was playing a role.\n\n\"We would intend in the autumn some time trying again to get the parties in Northern Ireland together,\" Mr Varadkar said.\n\n\"I think the absence of any clarity around Brexit makes that very difficult but if we can have that in October, I think there is an opportunity certainly before the end of the year to get the assembly and executive up and running.\"\n\nTalks over the past 18 months have failed to broker agreement between the two main parties.\n\nIn February Sinn Fein published parts of what it claimed was a draft agreement which would have restored government. However, DUP leader Arlene Foster said there was never any agreement she could put to her party.\n\nIn the intervening months Secretary of State Karen Bradley has resisted bringing in full direct rule although she has had to introduce legislation from Westminster to ensure government operations can continue. She has introduced two budgets and will move a public appointments bill in the autumn to allow the Policing Board to be reconstituted.\n\nArlene Foster has called for more London intervention in Northern Ireland to end the \"decision-making limbo\".\n\n\"This is not about wishing to see a return to Direct Rule but about the people of Northern Ireland needing decisions taken so they are not punished for the refusal to restore devolution,\" she said.\n\nA UK Government statement said: \"The Secretary of State and UK Government\u0027s top priority remains the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"She will continue to work with all the Northern Ireland parties - and with the Irish Government within the three stranded approach - to remove the barriers to restoring the Executive and a fully functioning Assembly.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"varadkar talks to restore powersharing in ni could begin in the autumn","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We have worked hard to reach agreement since Martin McGuinness resigned.”\n\nShe criticised the DUP for allegedly walking away from a previous attempt to reach agreement and the unionist party’s “negative” pact with the Conservatives.\n\n“It is not acceptable that the people of the North have had their rights denied and their agreements left unimplemented.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say august","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

I wasn’t going to wait for her to wean to start taking care of myself,” Yuri, from Texas, told the Press Association. \n\nThe little girl, who Yuri has chosen not to name in the media, tends to play as Yuri works out but often wants to breastfeed midway through the exercises. For that reason, Yuri prefers to workout as her daughter sleeps.\n\n“She mostly wants to eat when I’m laying on my back doing crunches or some other workout where I’m laying on the floor.”\n\nYuri breastfed her firstborn for 18 months. Her second child was formula fed and she struggled to breastfeed her third after a complicated start and her return to work, but her youngest, seen in the pictures, has “breastfed like a champ since day one”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Yuri Rydel)\n\n\n\n\nShe wanted to tell other breastfeeding mums that taking care of yourself didn’t have to mean an end to breastfeeding.\n\n“We don’t have to wait to stop breastfeeding, we don’t have to stop breastfeeding early just to get healthy – we can do both. \n\n“I realise that there will always be people who want to be negative about this topic. Hopefully, one day, when my daughters start a family they can freely breastfeed without fear of being bashed by a stranger.”\n\nOnline she wrote: “I’m not the only mom who is finally making time to care for themselves while taking care of their little ones.”\n\nYuri’s final pregnancy took her above 200lbs (14 stone 2lbs).\n\n“I said, ‘Oh well, I’ll never be at healthy weight again’. It wasn’t until I hit 221lbs that I decided I had to do this, for myself and my kids.”\n\nSo far Yuri, who married in 2015, has dropped 43lbs (3 stone), and wants to lose another 40lbs (2 stone 8lbs).\n"},{"url":null,"title":"people are upset that these futuristic things havent arrived in","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.
