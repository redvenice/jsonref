Noirmoutier circuitsAccessed along a paved causeway, the tidal isle of Noirmoutier is famed for the mimosa trees found amid its superb sandy beaches, salt marshes and oak forests. Three designated riding loops navigate the isle’s varied terrain – with the most central circuit also yielding such quaint villages as windmill-speckled La Guérinière. The cycle routes can be completed in one day or, if you prefer, at a more leisurely pace over successive days.  Noirmoutier is a three-hour drive from Saint-Malo’s ferry port, accessible via Brittany Ferries – allowing travellers to easily get to north-western France in the comfort and safety of their own car. 2. The Jade CoastAround a third of La Vélodyssée, France’s longest cycle route at more than 745 miles, is given over to the Atlantic Loire Valley region. South of Nantes (get there by train from Saint-Malo’s ferry port, via Rennes) and the Loire estuary, few trails are prettier than those tracing the 27-mile Jade Coast. Here, between Saint-Brevin-les-Pins and Bouin, riders will find rocky seascapes, broad Blue Flag shores, secret coves, traditional harbours and even the occasional bourgeois villa to admire. Dismount on Pointe Saint-Gildas, a wild headland affording fine estuary views, and look out for pêcheries: spindly little huts perched on pontoons to enable fishing with poles. The many charming resort towns, including Pornic, work well as bases thanks to their lively, strollable streets, seafood bistros and patisseries – this corner of France is the home of brioche. Thinking of seafood, the local specialties include sardines, anchovies, oysters and mussels. From the town of Ducey-les-Chéris, you’ll follow lanes with little traffic through woods, arable pastures and sleepy villages – vintage rural France, in other words. After a few hours and possibly a picnic, the Unesco-listed Mont-Saint-Michel will appear, with that marvellous, abbey-topped citadel. Out on the tidal island, the restaurant La Ferme St Michel majors in fresh, local products – think roasted apple with camembert and cacouyard or terrine of salt-meadow lamb. Rejuvenated? Then either continue onwards for 42 miles along the Vélomaritime past swimmable coves to reach Brittany Ferries’ port of Saint-Malo (in Brittany), or turn back and spend two days pedalling beside bocage-hedgerow landscapes north to Cherbourg. 4. Longues to ArromanchesEast of Cherbourg’s ferry port, the Vélomaritime route descends the Cotentin peninsula’s gorgeous reaches and passes all five of Normandy’s D-day landing beaches – offering a chance to combine cycling with fascinating, vital history. The five-mile route follows greenways from Longues-sur-Mer, crossing the cliffs above Gold beach to Arromanches-les-Bains. As it’s a short ride, there’s plenty of time to stop and take in the views whenever you like. The German battery at Longues remains well preserved, and has a visitor centre, while the British-built mulberry harbour at Arromanches also survives and houses a museum. You’ll find restaurants, too: the Cotentin is known for salt-meadow lamb while, what with this being Normandy’s calvados department, apple and pear brandies are guaranteed to be in good supply. It’s easy to explore the other D-day beaches en route as you pedal on toward the ferry port of Caen. 5. The Nantes-Brest canalLa Vélodyssée – France’s portion of the EuroVelo 1 route – starts at Roscoff, a port served by ferries from Plymouth, and takes in part of the glorious Nantes-Brest canal. The two meet just south of Carhaix-Plouguer and the partnership lasts for around 162 miles. Perfect for fun-filled family day trips by bike, the canal’s towpath promises a steady, gentle diet of barges, woodland, lakes, and locks garlanded with flowers. Especially photogenic is the steep-sided Blavet Valley, thanks chiefly to lush vegetation and imposing lock-keepers’ buildings. Kids too young to ride could perch in child seats, or you might consider hiring tandem bikes. Cycling a canal section makes for a lovely inland interruption to holidays otherwise spent exploring the sandy seasides and ancient fishing hamlets and towns around Roscoff, Quimper or Vannes. 6. Dinard to QuestembertOne of Brittany’s long-distance cycle paths – Route 3 – winds south from Dinard (a boat-hop across the Rance river from Saint-Malo), initially along the Canal d’Ille et Rance. At more than 124 miles and mostly confined to quiet roads or greenways, it’s ideal for cycling enthusiasts or families with energetic teenagers. The best section comes after Malestroit, when you’ll cross the Landes de Lanvaux’s high, open heathland riding on smooth paths. Before that, close to Mauron, the trail fringes the Forest of Brocéliande, whose Arthurian-legend locations include the Valley of No Return, the Golden Tree and – supposedly – Merlin’s Tomb, all possible ersions. It’s easy to pitch up along the way at pretty campsites such as Brocéliande’s Camping Merlin l’Enchanteur, where two swimming pools (one for kids) await. Four days is the typical Route 3 duration, but many go slow and take a week. From Questembert, trains can have you back on Saint-Malo’s beaches in a little more than two hours. The lungfuls of fresh air will continue during the ferry home too, what with so much open space both inside and out on deck.

For a bite-size section, head to pretty Perros-Guirec, two hours’ drive from Saint-Malo, being sure to try traditional galettes at Crêperie du Ranolien, before hiking the Pink Granite coast, with its rosy boulders reminiscent of Seychelles. Alternatively head for the Crozon peninsula, a three-hour drive cross-country from the port, for lovely swimming creeks and imposing headlands jutting into water the colour of mouthwash. The island loop one: Belle-Île-en-Mer, BrittanyWho knew there was a tiny island paradise so close to home, where white sands meet turquoise waves, lighthouses decorate promontories and sweet seaside cottages are painted candy colours. A little like a French take on the Isles of Scilly, Belle-Île-en-Mer has long attracted creatives such as Claude Monet, who painted its imposing Port Coton needles, and one of the early stars of the screen, the bohemian actress Sarah Bernhardt, who moved into the military fort here in 1894, hosting glamorous parties, with Edward VII among her guests. The fort is now a little museum, in a beautiful spot on the Pointe des Poulains, one of the highlights of the 51-mile coastal path that circles Brittany’s largest island. The path threads together the sheltered coves of the east, steep cliffs in the south, dunes for children to tumble down, and Le Palais harbour. Le Palais, the island’s main town, is where you’ll arrive if you take the hour-long ferry ride from Quiberon on the mainland. Ride the bus to different sections of the path and be sure to have an evening cocktail at Le Grand Large hotel, overlooking the sea. The magical forest one: Brittany’s mythical forestHolidays to Brittany are very often all about the sea, but there are magical walking routes too in the interior’s marshes, forests and hills. Brittany’s once-vast forest of Paimpont, west of Rennes, is thought to be the one referred to in medieval folklore and myths as Brocéliande, an enchanted, fairy-filled forest associated with Arthurian legends. Today, themed trails and a museum at the Château de Comper bring the stories to life, adding an ethereal slant to family walks on the forest’s network of fern-lined trails. Your closest base could be Brittany’s vibrant capital, Rennes, an hour’s drive south from the ferry port at St Malo. The dramatic one: Normandy’s Alabaster coast on the GR21For anyone yearning to tackle one of Europe’s mammoth GR hiking trails there couldn’t be a handier starting point than that of Normandy’s iconic GR21, which begins in the city of Le Havre, arrival port for the Brittany Ferries crossing from Portsmouth. Whether you ditch your car immediately and strike out to walk the full 115-mile route north to the fishing village of Le Tréport, which usually takes seven to 10 days, or drive to stroll shorter sections, is a matter for you and your thigh muscles to decide. The geology of this stretch echoes that on the other side of the Channel, with dramatic high white chalk cliffs earning it the moniker the Alabaster coast. While the beaches of Normandy might still be associated with the noisy barrages of D-day, now only the wind tussling the leaves and the odd gull call will prick your ears, leaving mental space for contemplation on a peaceful route voted best hiking trail in France in 2019’s annual French Hiking Federation survey. The path doesn’t always follow the coast due to the fragility of the cliffs, but descends often to beaches and villages tucked into ravines where rivers meet the sea, such as Fécamp, with an abbey, and Dieppe, with wonderful seafood restaurants. Look out too for second world war sites and Delacroix’s painting subject, St Pierre-en-Port. Just a little past Le Tréport, the lovely belle epoque seaside resort of Mers-les-Bains, with quaint bathing huts on a lively seafront, is a fabulous place to finish up. The boozy one: Normandy’s cider routeWhether you stagger it, swagger it or dart along like a teetotal hare, the 25-mile cider route is a beauty, connecting more than 20 cider farms in the lovely Pays d’Auge region of lower Normandy. Densely wooded hills, villages of colourful timber-framed houses, chateaux and farmland comprise a gorgeous backdrop for immersion in the appley booze-making expertise of the area. You’ll learn to appreciate the slightly bitter flavour of local ciders – neither sandpaper dry or juicy-sweet – perfect for quenching the thirst of parched hikers. Calvados (apple brandy), sometimes mixed with apple juice to make pommeau, has to be tasted along with perries and cheeses. Where should you base yourself? Try any of the characterful hotels in ancient towns such as Cambremer. The cultural one: the Loire estuary The Loire river may be most famous for the beautiful chateaux that decorate its banks, but many other interesting features lend it character as it wends its way west to the Atlantic. At its finale, a wide estuary forms a fascinating natural and semi-industrial environment that’s fun to explore on foot. A 37-mile trail through the estuary from Nantes to the ocean, takes in fishing villages, nature reserves and a fantastic art trail, the Estuaire Nantes\u0026lt\u0026gtSaint-Nazaire, featuring 33 mind-bending sculptures, dotted along the water’s edge. Picking out one section for a day’s walk, you might opt for the lively 11-mile stretch from Paimbœuf, a village of brightly coloured houses, to the seaside resort of Saint-Brevin-les-Pins, on the southern side opposite Saint-Nazaire. It offers sandy beaches, fishing huts on stilts and the art trail’s “Serpent d’Ocean” by Huang Yong Ping, a huge skeleton of a sea serpent submerged in the breakers that’s thrilling for children. Alternatively there are dozens of other shorter walking trails of a few miles throughout the southern estuary area, which are easily doable for little legs. The hilly one: the Alpes MancellesFor not-too-tough hiking challenges in a mountainous region that resembles a mini version of the Alps, head to the pretty Alpes Mancelles in the Atlantic Loire. The mountains here top out at only 200-400m, bless them, so are relatively easy to conquer, but will still earn you the kudos of having summited some of the highest peaks in western France. Le Mont des Avaloirs, at 416m, is the big boy of the region, providing wonderful views of the Sarthe river from a Brutalist-style concrete lookout point at the top. Across the unspoilt massif, hundreds of kilometres of paths explore wooded slopes and valleys, and loop from authentic villages such as Fresnay-sur-Sarthe, a medieval town on a rocky outcrop with a ninth century chateau to visit. There’s tons for families to do too, from hiking with donkeys to high-ropes courses in the trees.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top five cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high risk (cohort 4) and those aged 60 to 69 (cohort 5).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspaged 16 to 64 who are at high risk (cohort 7).

Photograph: Collins Taoiseach Micheál Martin told the Dáil he would talk to the HSE again to ensure maternity units comply with current national guidance to provide access for partners of expectant mothers to scans, birth and post-natal appointments.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said that despite the Chief Medical Office, the chief executive of the HSE, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health advocating for change “these restrictions are a reality”.Ms McDonald said “partners are not visitors and need to have access along with the pregnant woman for appointments, scans, for labour and for post-natal care”.Sinn Féin Cork South-Central TD Donnchadh O Laoighaire said he was “one of those partners” and was very disappointed to hear he could not attend for the 34-week scan.Ms McDonald called for the Taoiseach to “bring together the masters of hospitals and managers of hospitals with maternity units because the situation needs to be rectified now”.Mr Martin reiterated his view that “there is no good reason in public health terms as to why these restrictions remain in place” given the success of the vaccine rollout and the suppression of the virus.He said the updated guidelines from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre state it is “generally appropriate to facilitate attendance by a partner through active labour and childbirth, after 20 weeks scans and also daily visits in visiting for example neo-natal units”.In the wake of the HSE chief executive writing to maternity units seeking confirmation that they were implementing the current guidelines, the Taoiseach said “I will talk again to the HSE to make sure that this is complied with”.Lack of progressEarlier Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly confirmed the units had been written to by the HSE in relation to access for partners of mothers.Mr Donnelly said he was “quite frustrated” at the lack of progress in some areas about providing this access, and said the HSE was too.If a hospital feels it is unable to provide access due to infection control issues relating to Covid-19, it will have make a case for this in writing to the HSE, he said.The Minister said on Wednesday he was expecting to receive a report from the HSE on the issue later.The issue of providing access for birth partners to maternity units has been the subject of controversy in recent months, with advocates for greater access this week mounting protests outside some hospitals.Access was restricted late last year during the third wave of the pandemic, and have been eased only slightly since.Some hospitals say their infrastructure makes it difficult to facilitate safe access for partners during before, during and after birth.Mr Donnelly said he would be bringing detailed updated plans on the further rollout of vaccines to Cabinet next week, once detailed advice is received from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee.This will include more accurate timing on the vaccination of each age group, he said.Antigen testingOn antigen testing Mr Martin insisted in the Dáil that there was no “mixed messaging” or confusion around antigen testing but “a difference of opinion, different perspectives on efficacy”.He was challenged by Labour leader Alan Kelly who said there was “complete confusion” around its use.Mr Kelly said he used the test weekly after he returned home to Tipperary after the Dáil each week. He said it was good enough to be used for hauliers and the Minister for Higher and Further Education was depending on it being rolled out in the autumn for third level colleges.The Taoiseach, chief medical officer and Minister for Health favour its use, but the chairman of the Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group, Prof Philip Nolan, described it as “snake oil”. Mr Kelly said the “mixed messaging” has to stop.Mr Martin said it is already being used by certain sectors including meat plants and the European Commission has promoted its use.Mr Donnelly said he was a supporter of antigen testing but by itself it was not “a silver bullet”.A negative test from antigen “doesn’t mean you’re negative” and should be ignored, he said.The Minister was speaking in Tallaght after publishing the Sláintecare implementation strategy and action plan 2021-2023.Social Democrats co-leader Róisin Shortall said it contained a number of positive commitments but failed to provide a detailed timeline or breakdown of the budget.“Moving forward with Sláintecare is essential. Front-line workers in the health service performed heroically throughout the pandemic, but Covid has caused enormous damage,” she said."},{"url":null,"title":"review of funds given to an taisce demanded at fianna f%C3%A1il party meeting","story":"An Taisce is  set to appeal in the courts against planning permission granted for a €140 million Glanbia cheese plant in Co Kilkenny. A Glanbia plant in Idaho, US, is pictured above.The group, which is set to appeal in the courts against planning permission granted for a €140 million plant in Co Kilkenny, has defended itself against strong criticism over its approach in recent days.The cheese plant, proposed for Belview in the south of Co Kilkenny, is a joint venture between Glanbia and Dutch cheesemakers Royal A-Ware, but An Taisce has made several objections to the plan, saying the new facility and the increased agricultural activity needed to support it would increase carbon emissions and damage water quality.Jackie Cahill, Fianna Fáil TD for Tipperary, said the group, which is partially state-funded has been “treasonous in their actions”, sources at the parliamentary party meeting said on Wednesday. He added that the group had no understanding or regard for the agricultural sector, and demanded a full review of public funds given to it. The Taoiseach Micheál Martin told the meeting that Glanbia is a “symptom of a wider issue of the planning system”, and said challenges can create ision “when we are trying to progress climate action measures”. The meeting also heard strong criticism of Sinn Féin from the Taoiseach, who told his parliamentary party colleagues that by his research, the party has opposed the construction of over 5,000 homes in the last five years, and argued that the level of opposition is making the housing crisis worse. He told the meeting the Government plan was about “substance and delivery,” sources said. However, he came under criticism from backbencher Marc MacSharry, who said he should declare a housing emergency and set targets for each local authority. The Sligo-Leitrim TD said the Government’s policies were “Fine Gael lite”, and tantamount to window dressing “when we need to renovate the whole house”. The Taoiseach told the meeting they were “working on dealing with the issues of institutional investors competing with first time buyers”. “We don’t have the luxury of opposing everything and sloganeering,” he said, telling the meeting that Sinn Féin do that “time and time again”. “If we are serious we need to facilitate and drive on with supply”. Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly also indicated “100 per cent” support for a motion from Cavan-Monaghan TD Niamh Smyth calling for a public health campaign around menopause, and requesting supports for the emotional, physical and mental health of women approaching and experiencing menopause. She and others, including the Taoiseach, commended recent broadcasts by Joe Duffy on RTÉ’s Liveline programme on the topic. Ms Smyth told the meeting that women’s testimony was a “damning indictment of the State’s attitude and response to women’s reproductive health.”Mr Martin supported Ms Smyth’s motion on a campaign on menopause. Mr Donnelly, sources said, also told the meeting that there was a need for maternity units to be fully accessible and had asked for reports from all 19 units on their policies - and was expecting a report tonight from the HSE on the issue. The Taoiseach said he welcomed the result of the Ballymurphy inquest, and paid tribute to the families involved in the campaign. He reiterated his words to cabinet on Tuesday, saying housing had to be treated as a whole of Government issue, similarly to Covid and Brexit.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe  Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said everyone who wants a Covid-19 vaccine appointment could be offered one by the end of June.Mr Varadkar raised the prospect at a Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting on Wednesday evening, it is understood.Sources said Mr Varadkar also told TDs and Senators that an announcement will be made at the end of this month about the future of the State’s pandemic welfare supports. Some supports could in fact be prolonged into next year for sectors like hospitality, tourism, aviation and the arts, he said.It is understood he told members that while nothing has been decided, the financial supports will not be removed from July 1st or anywhere around that time.While an initial boom could be expected with the economy re-opening, this could fall away and the Government does not want to withdraw supports while the economy is still recovering and many people are still not back at work, he said.Multiple sources also said that the Tánaiste effectively ruled out any hikes to income tax over the coming years after the IMF said a gradual increase in tax revenue should be considered after next year, once a recovery from Covid-19 has taken hold.While carbon taxes would rise and the local property tax would be revised, he told the parliamentary party that the Government should not “concede” to increases to income taxes.There was also a conversation about the housing crisis, an issue which is back on the political centre-stage.He is understood to have told the meeting that family homelessness is down 40 per cent from the peak but that many people were not aware of this. Sources said however Mr Varadkar said enough is not being done and that in terms of home ownership the problem is worsening.He is understood to have described it as a “breach of the social contract”, sources said, saying it is not surprising that parties like Fine Gael are not doing as well in the polls given this fact.Mr Varadkar also referenced a “Waterford Whispers” satire article which mocked Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil for “only discovering that there is a housing crisis last week”. “He said he did not want this to be something that people perceived as being true,” a source at the meeting said.The meeting also heard fresh comments on the growing row over the development of a €140 million cheese plant.Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said An Taisce should not appeal a High Court decision backing the development of the plant, prompting members of the Green Party to come out in support of the heritage organisation.The High Court’s recent decision in favour of the Belview plant in south Co Kilkenny, should see the joint venture between Glanbia and Dutch cheesemakers Royal A-Ware proceed. However An Taisce, which has made several environmental objections to the plan, is set to appeal.At the Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting, Minister of State Patrick O’Donovan said public representatives are entitled to express their views and said it was nothing compared to a coalition TD taking his own Government to the High Court. Sources said he was referring to Green Party TD Patrick Costello’s case on the Ceta trade agreement.Mr Varadkar said the party was “fully behind” projects in the South East.Senator Tim Lombard said it was important that Fine Gael “came out in front” on the issue and said the party needed to be strong on the matter."},{"url":null,"title":"martin says politicians entitled to comment on planning as he defends an taisce remarks","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin said politicians ‘every day of the week write to planning authorities. They are entitled to make observations. That’s a fact’. Photograph: Daragh Mc SweeneyProvisionTaoiseach Micheál Martin has said politicians are entitled to comment on planning issues as he defended his remarks urging heritage organisation An Taisce to withdraw its appeal against the construction of a €140 million cheese factory in Co Kilkenny.Mr Martin was speaking in the Dáil as Social Democrats TD Holly Cairns questioned the appropriateness of such remarks “from a Taoiseach”.Ms Cairns said he was pitting the farmers against environmentalists in his approach. The factory is a joint venture between Glanbia and Dutch cheesemakers Royal A-ware and the Cork South-West TD said the Netherlands had reduced its herd by 190,000, while Ireland’s had increased by 500,000.She asked the Taoiseach to explain how increasing the herd, which would increase emission fines, could be a positive step for Irish farming. “Farmers deserve more respect,” she said.Ms Cairns said the Taoiseach had previously told her it was inappropriate for Government members to intervene in planning issues when she raised the proposed development of the site of the mother and baby home at Bessborough, Co Cork.Mr Martin rejected her comments and said politicians “every day of the week write to planning authorities. They are entitled to make observations. That’s a fact”.EnvironmentDefending his stance on the environment, he said the Government has brought in a landmark climate change Bill. “I want to bring people along with us,” he said.On Tuesday Mr Martin said An Taisce should withdraw its appeal of the High Court judgment to approve planning permission for the manufacturing plant in Belview , in south Kilkenny.He said the project was of “immense economic importance” to both the industry and the region.“Many, many jobs depend on it and there has to be balance in terms of how we all behave in society” he said.The Taoiseach added that an appeal would create unnecessary tensions and ision but his own comments prompted a series of responses from a number of Green Party TDs, including Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman, who said on RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland that it is “generally” better for politicians not to get involved in the planning processes. He said that politicians should leave the processes to “play out”.Mr O’Gorman said An Taisce has a long track record in seeking compliance with environmental standards and the heritage body was best placed to decide whether it will continue its appeal.On Tuesday Green Party chairman of the Oireachtas Housing Committee Steven Matthews expressed disappointment at the Taoiseach’s comments about An Taisce.Mr Matthews said it would be preferable if politicians did not cast judgement on live planning matters.People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy said the Taoiseach’s approach to An Taisce “was reminiscent of Donald Trump”.Mr Martin’s comments had been sparked by rural Independent TDs’ criticism of An Taisce and calls for State funding to be withdrawn from the organisation because it was a “serial objector”.In the Dáil on Wednesday the Taoiseach said “our planning system is there to vindicate citizens’ rights” and “that can never be tied to the provision of funding to any organisation”."},{"url":null,"title":"urgent need to reform liquidation law to prevent retail massacre d%C3%A1il hears","story":"Former Debenhams staff rally outside the store on Henry Street in Dublin: New Bill aims to ‘change the law to place workers in the very front of the queue when it comes to making payments from liquidators’ pots’, says  Mick Barry. File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThere is an urgent need to reform legislation on liquidations to protect workers from a “retail massacre” in the autumn when state supports are withdrawn, the Dáil has been told.Solidarity TD Mick Barry made the claim as he introduced a Bill to prioritise workers in future liquidations. Mr Barry said 30 per cent of shops on Henry Street, Dublin, are empty with a similar situation in shopping centres around the country.“Another big wave of redundancies” will happen in the autumn he said. “There is, therefore, an urgent need to put in place protections for these workers in advance of the withdrawal of State supports for business.”He was introducing the Companies (Protection of Employees’ Rights in Liquidations) Bill, nicknamed the Debenhams Bill for former workers at the department store who have been protesting outside the company’s shops for the past 13 months since its liquidation.Mr Barry said the Bill would not benefit the mainly female Debenhams workforce but it aims to “change the law to place workers in the very front of the queue when it comes to making payments from liquidators’ pots as is the case in Greece, France and Portugal”.He accused the Government of “double standards” because it was proposing changes in examinerships to facilitate businesses but “doesn’t see the urgent need to change the liquidation law for workers”.People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny said of the long-running Debenhams’ protest that “this strike will come to a conclusion, probably in the next couple of weeks”.He said the strike would be remembered alongside the Dunnes Stores anti-apartheid strike and the dispute at Clondalkin Paper Mills.Fair settlementMr Kenny said the workers wanted a fair settlement for decades of work and to ensure that a similar situation never occurred again, where the company “let them down terribly” and where, he claimed, they were “subject to police harassment and maligned by Debenhams and by certain parts of the Government”.He criticised the Government for failing to implement the Duffy Cahill report published five years ago on workers’ rights in insolvencies, which he said would have prevented the Debenhams situation.“Reports are printed, put on shelves and nothing happens,” he said.But Minister of State Damien English said it was “wrong, untrue and dishonest to keep linking” Debenhams with the situation at Clerys department store, on which the Duffy Cahill report was based. He said the report’s authors said it would not have prevented the issues with Debenhams because they were two different situations.The Government called for debate on the legislation to be delayed for 12 months pending its own legislation to enhance protection of employees as creditors “in a way that does not unduly impede enterprises in the conduct of their business”.Mr English and Mr Troy stressed the legislation would be brought forward sooner than the 12-month deadline.Mr Troy insisted the Government “has done all that it can to ensure that former Debenhams workers’ legal rights and entitlements were vindicated” and it went further in recognising “the significance of the situation”.He said “what Government did not do was unfairly build up former Debenhams workers’ expectations of what could be done.“It is entirely regrettable that this happened – at their expense – and that some exploited their situation for political gain,” he said.However, People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett claimed the Government “sat idly by” while Debenhams workers “stood on picket lines in hail, rain and snow throughout this pandemic, fighting for justice and the right cause on behalf of every worker in this country”.He said “there will likely be a retail massacre, with more workers facing the injustice the Debenhams workers have faced”."},{"url":null,"title":"the eu s grand plans to curb climate change rely on local buy ins","story":"Those warning of the imminence of catastrophic climate change have won the argument. Green has become mainstream. Photograph: iStockThe European Union has committed to cut its carbon admissions by at least 55 per cent over the next nine years, compared to 1990 levels. It’s intended as a step on the way to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, by which point the bloc aims to emit no more of the greenhouse gas than it can absorb.It’s all part of the so-called European Green Deal: an umbrella term for an array of targets, laws, funding and incentives for climate-friendly innovation and industries that its proponents hope will amount to a wholesale transformation of the economies of the 27 member states, all while improving quality of life and maintaining prosperity.Can it be done? In an attempt to get there, more than 50 new laws or reforms addressing carbon emissions and environmental standards are on the legislative schedule of the EU institutions over the next 18 months, according to a tally by the chairman of the European Parliament’s environment committee, MEP Pascal Canfin.Before any become concrete, they must make it through the EU legislative process: first, proposal by the European Commission, then negotiations with the national leaders of EU countries and the European Parliament, and finally agreement on a compromise.Each negotiation is a grand clash of interest groups, with intense lobbying from industry, NGOs, erse member states with varying interests, and tussling between Europe’s political groups.Watershed year“Each file is a battle,” says\u0026nbspCanfin, a French MEP from president Emmanuel Macron’s party. “Sometimes it’s some part of the farming community that does not want to change its practices, sometimes it’s one industry that do not want to change either, and so on and so on.”Nevertheless, he describes the past year as a watershed for climate issues. Of the EU’s landmark Covid-19 recovery fund, €250 billion is committed to green reforms, and funds are tied to requirements not to do environmental harm.Crucially, while there are intense disagreements over how to reach the climate goals, and green campaigners continually warn that targets are too modest or insufficiently enforced, there is no longer significant ision over the aim of cutting emissions in itself. Those warning of the imminence of catastrophic climate change have won the argument. Green has become mainstream.“The direction of travel is very clear and unchallenged,” Canfin said. “I mean, for the green deal agenda, we’re looking at changing the state aid regime, the competition policy, the budget policy, the industrial policy, the trade policy . . . there is no taboo anymore. This has never before been the case.”Internationally, the mood is favourable, as US president Joe Biden has announced similar ambitions with his Green New Deal. Germany has decided to harden its carbon emissions targets to cut 65 per cent by 2030 – a response to a ruling by its constitutional court, which found its prior goals placed too great a burden on future generations.A shift in position by the major car-making nation towards electric vehicles would be significant for the continent, to say nothing of the possibility of a Green leader succeeding Angela Merkel as chancellor (a lot can happen before the vote in September, but currently Annalena Baerbock’s\u0026nbspAlliance 90The Greens are dominating the campaign).‘Zero pollution’ planTo give a sample of the EU’s heavily green legislative agenda: on the table are proposals to start charging the airline and maritime transport industries for their carbon emissions to strengthen legally binding national emissions targets in the agriculture, building, transport, and waste sectors to mandate energy efficiency in buildings to protect wetland, forest, and meadow carbon sinks to incentivise the use of renewable energy and electric vehicles – to name a few.The latest is a plan for “zero pollution” laid out by the European Commission on Wednesday. It would aim to half plastic litter in the sea, cut the amount of microplastics released into the environment, and half the number of premature deaths due to polluted air (air pollution shortens the lives of over 400,000 Europeans a year, according to the European Environment Agency).But hidden within the zero pollution proposal is a clue about the difficulty of the task ahead. Much of the proposal involves not new laws, but the implementation of existing regulations which have either been ignored or patchily enacted within member states.Implementation is a perennial problem, particularly when it comes to climate and environmental regulations, which often govern acts that take place in remote locations, policed by under-funded local authorities, backed up by national powers that can be indifferent at best. Communication, public buy-in, and enforcement at national level will ultimately decide whether the EU’s climate ambitions will come to pass or remain paper targets.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Covid public inquiry must examine lockdown\u0026#39s social and economic impacts, urge Tory MPsSage calls emergency meeting over rapid spread of Indian variant as No10 plays down reopening fearsAs tensions reach boiling point, Northern Ireland\u0026#39s loyalist groups warn of a return to violenceBoris Johnson urged to fight back against \u0026#39woke warriors\u0026#39Lord Goldsmith forced to delete a tweet expressing support for IsraelSpecial report: How our GP services lapsed into long-term sicknessComment: Barnier’s incendiary immigration U-turn betrays the panic gripping the French eliteWhat the Covid public inquiry will likely look atGPs told to screen patients online firstSocial media chiefs face jail if they refuse to hand over secret algorithmsTrans women told by doctors they are \u0026#39not wearing enough lipstick\u0026#39BBC apologises to Sir James Dyson after labelling him as a \u0026#39prominent Conservative supporter\u0026#39Boris Johnson urged to appoint minister for social care to turn around crumbling sectorExclusive: Trainee fighting for his career after backing teacher who showed Mohammed picturesCovid test comparison website to end confusion for holidaymakersJoe Biden says \u0026#39Israel has right to defend itself\u0026#39 as US throws its support behind Jewish StateUkrainian scientists investigate spike in nuclear reactions at Chernobyl\u0026#39s inaccessible roomTeacher at prestigious boarding school given job reference that didn’t disclose warning for ‘touching students’The ‘Blue Wall’ could collapse, Tory rebels warn Boris Johnson over planning reforms\u0026#39No evidence\u0026#39 of staycation boom for Scotland\u0026#39s crisis-hit tourism industryBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ancient mayan treasure worth 86000 discovered hidden cellar","story":"Ancient Maya treasures are to be returned to Mexico and Guatemala after they were found hidden in the cellar of a farmhouse in Germany.Fifteen-hundred-year-old clay sculptures, dishes and cups believed to be worth more than €100,000 (£86,000) were found at the private home in Klötze, a village in the eastern region of Saxony-Anhalt.Police searched the cellar after a former owner confessed he had hidden unlicensed guns there.But officers were stunned when they unearthed a black plastic bag containing the Mayan artefacts.Independent experts commissioned by the regional authorities say the artworks are genuine.The 13 items include two delicate miniature figures which are believed to be from the ancient Mexican city of Teotihuacán and date back to between 250 and 250AD.One of the figures is a candle-holder and is believed to depict the ancient Mayan god of fire.The other items are believed to come from northern Guatemala and include decorated cups and dishes, and shards of broken glass vesselsExperts say they were probably illegally excavated and sold on the black market, and they are to be returned to the governments of Mexico and Guatemala as the rightful owners.“I will return them to the ambassadors on May 20,” Reiner Haseloff, the regional prime minister of Saxony-Anhalt told Bild newspaper.The existence of the artefacts was only uncovered after the former owner of the farmhouse contacted police to confess to a crime.The 66-year-old, who has lived in France for many years, telephoned local police to admit he had hidden his grandfather’s unlicensed Second World War rifle and pistol in the cellar.He told police he bought the Mayan artworks at a flea market and had no idea of their provenance.Police say he will not face prosecution as Germany had no law against buying illegally excavated artworks from abroad at the time he obtained them.He will also escape prosecution over the firearms as the statute of limitations has expired.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"daves cringey dad texts mortifying mistake yet","story":"David, David you need to be more chill.

Not quite.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inquiry must do apportion blame","story":"Indeed, since the virus is likely to return in the winter, even next spring may be a problematic point at which to start the inquiry. There is concern about a possible flu epidemic since the historically low rates of the disease over the past 12 months make vaccines harder to adapt.A perfectly legitimate case can be made for not having this type of inquiry at all but since Mr Johnson would have been hounded until he agreed, it was pointless to resist. However, it will last for years, whereas the lessons from the pandemic need to be learned now. Many of them are already apparent. The World Health Organisation’s panel of independent experts and senior political figures, which has reported within just a few months, set out just a few of them yesterday.We know all of this without the need for a public inquiry. As to the actions of the British Government, several parliamentary committees have taken extensive evidence from senior Government advisers and Sage scientists while auditors have looked into the speed, cost and propriety of the procurement process. Again, what has been learned must be taken on board now and not await the outcome of a public inquiry. We may have to deal with another epidemic before it reports.The inquiry chairman has yet to be appointed and the terms of reference are still to be announced. The former is likely to be a judge and the latter must range more widely than public health matters. A sterile argument over whether the country should have locked down a week or two before it did will help no one, but is likely to be the conclusion sought by Mr Johnson’s opponents.Given what has happened, it is evident that the strategy for dealing with a pandemic was flawed and the shortcomings need to be put right now.

even though the crown has been defunct since the end of the Second World War.Vittoria di Savoia, a 17-year-old schoolgirl, represents the fresh-faced younger generation of the House of Savoy, an ancient royal lineage which provided Italy’s kings from unification in the 19th century to the abolishing of the monarchy in 1946.Despite being sent into exile for decades, the family has never quite given up hope that they might one day be reinstated to the throne – despite the fact that there is currently scant support for such a restoration.Now Prince Vittorio Emanuele, the son of Italy’s last king, has changed an ancient custom known as the Salic Law, which had stipulated that the royal line could only pass to male heirs.It means that Vittoria, his grand-daughter, is now second in line after her father Prince Emanuele Filiberto, who is well known in Italy for having taken part in a local version of Dancing with the Stars. He is also an entrepreneur and set up a food truck in Los Angeles, naming it The Prince of Venice after one of his many titles.The change to the succession rules has provoked the ire of a rival branch of the royal dynasty, the Dukes of Aosta, who have long jostled with their cousins for primacy over the House of Savoy name.There has been bad blood between them for years – in 2004, Prince Vittorio Emanuele was involved in a dust-up at a Spanish royal wedding in which he allegedly punched his cousin and rival, Duke Amedeo of Aosta.The Aostas have condemned the repeal of the Salic Law and the change to the rules of succession as illegitimate.That criticism does not faze Prince Emanuele Filiberto, who says that reforming the succession law is simply keeping up with the times, a way of recognising gender equality.“It’s true that the monarchy does not exist in Italy anymore, but never say never. Look at what happened in Spain, when the king was restored after the Franco dictatorship. You never know,” he told The  from his home in Monte Carlo.Once she finishes school, Vittoria will study economics, philosophy and art at the University of London.The experience could make her “just a little bit British,” the prince jokes, saying that The Crown and the saga of Harry and Meghan has helped raise interest in all royal families, including Italy’s.In the meantime, his daughter – the eldest of two sisters - is being groomed to inherit the leadership of the House of Savoy by her father, who calls her the “rock n’ roll princess” for her interest in fashion and social media.“We’re one of the oldest royal families in Europe, with more than 1,000 years of history. She will be a  of that heritage and will also run our charities, which do important work in Italy, like taking underprivileged kids in Naples, Rome and Turin to theatres and museums,” he said.Vittoria, whose mother is the French actress Clotilde Courau, will one day be head of the Savoy’s dynastic order, which counts 3,000 knights among its members.“She’s a young girl and I’m sure she’ll be able to bring modernity to the institution. There are lots of female heads of royal families now and in Britain you have the most outstanding example – the Queen has been a wonderful leader of the House of Windsor all these years,” the prince said.The Aosta branch of the royal dynasty argue that any changes to the rules of succession should only be allowed once the monarchy is restored – which for now seems a very distant prospect.One of the scions of the Aosta branch, Prince Aimone, has two sons so the principle of male-only succession suits the family well.“I would rather not stoke the controversy,” the prince, who works as a manager for the tyre-manufacturing firm Pirelli in Moscow, told Corriere della Sera last year.“Realistically I don’t believe the monarchy will return to Italy, although one cannot predict the future or exclude anything.”Despite the bitter feud, Prince Emanuele Filiberto says he tries to be magnanimousto his upstart cousins.“I really have nothing against the Aostas,” he said. “It was our branch that was recognised by the Italian Republic, not their junior branch. I have invited them to come and work with us. It is a sad situation – mainly for them.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tensions reach boiling point northern irelands loyalist groups","story":"Loyalist paramilitary groups in Belfast have warned Northern Ireland is a matchstick away from being ignited saying Boris Johnson has sold us down the tubes.Northern Ireland is facing the biggest threat to peace there’s ever been since the Good Friday Agreement was signed 23 years ago, as politicians say violence has returned to politics in the province.The apparent lack of opportunity in Unionist communities, coupled with the Brexit protocol and the failure to prosecute Sinn Fein leaders over an IRA funeral last year has created a “perfect storm”, community leaders say.The  was given exclusive access to people close to the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Red Hand Commando, all Loyalist paramilitary groups.Dean, a Loyalist community worker close to North Belfast UDA, said the area of Tiger’s Bay had gone to “wrack and ruin” since the Good Friday Agreement. “This community has gained nothing from the peace process. Nothing, he said.Speaking to the  in North Belfast, Stephen, another community worker, said: “The IRA have got what they wanted by bombing and murder. We don’t want to go down that route, but is that the only option for us?“London needs to know there\u0027s a new generation that is so angry and bitter you can cut it with a knife. “This is the biggest threat to peace there’s ever been.”The Northern Ireland protocol, part of the Brexit settlement with the EU, keeps the province under EU Single Market rules. It has created a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Critics say it leaves Northern Ireland subject to an external law-making body, the EU, and court (the European Court of Justice) without recourse to the British government. Despite promises that there would be no customs border in the Irish Sea, Boris Johnson agreed to the protocol as a way of protecting the Good Friday Agreement, as it was thought a land customs border between the UK and Ireland would be attacked by Republican paramilitaries.“Boris Johnson has sold us down the tubes and he’ll regret it. He’s seriously misunderstood this,” Dean said.Speaking in the New Beginnings office in Tiger’s Bay, Michael Bingham, 60, said the Good Friday Agreement is now being used as a “beating stick against the Protestant people”.“I thought 1998 would be the year this all stopped and our kids could have a normal life. “Sitting here in 2021, there’s been some changes but all the trouble hasn’t gone away, it’s still hanging over your shoulder.“I want to let our children know there is an alternative to all this. But we can’t do it without political backup.Michael spoke to the  at one of the Peace Lines: walls and barriers used to separate protestant and catholic communities. The total length of peace line barriers has increased since the Good Friday Agreement was signed. “People are still being attacked in their homes, people are still being shot, bombs are still being planted under cars, prison officers are being murdered, Michael said. Is it a peace process or not? It only seems to be so on one side at the moment.”Whitehall security sources told the  a range of issues have left Loyalists feeling insecure about their identity and future, adding: unrest and unease has been building for some time.Both main Unionist parties  are currently electing new leaders, with the DUP expected to elect Arlene Foster\u0027s successor on Friday.The party\u0027s rulebook says the new leader and deputy - Nigel Dodds stood down on May 5 - will be elected by assembly members, MPs and peers.Edwin Poots, Northern Ireland’s agricultural minister, is the hardline favourite, having been a vocal opponent of post-Brexit trading arrangements in the province. His rival, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP’s incumbent Westminster leader,  is seen as the moderate candidate.Loyalists will want to see a fresh approach to the Good Friday Agreement and the protocol from the new leader .Winston ‘Winkie’ Irvine, a spokesman for the Progressive Unionist Party, said support for the Good Friday Agreement among Loyalist communities was “haemorrhaging”.Speaking to the  in the offices of Action for Community Transformation on the Shankill Road in West Belfast, he said: “People are saying ‘this isn’t what I signed up for, what I went to jail for. This isn\u0027t why my family are lying in graveyards across Northern Ireland.“The dangers are absolutely massive. We’re a matchstick away from this place being ignited.”Referring to the riots that broke out across Northern Ireland two weeks ago, Mr Irvine, who is close to West Belfast UVF, said: “We came within minutes of a potential bloodbath. “That scene was reminiscent of the outbreak of the Troubles here on the Shankill 50 years ago. The only thing that was missing was people having their houses petrol bombed. “Had that happened we would have been into full scale military engagement using physical force not just petrol bombs and masonry, we would have been in a deep dangerous spiral of tit-for-tat.”The funeral in 2020 of leading IRA figure Bobby Storey, attended by around 2,000 supporters when Covid rules limited attendee numbers to 15, is a source of particular anger among Loyalists. They are disgusted no action was taken against Sinn Fein organisers, or Michelle O’Neill, Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, for attending.“She knew the rules inside out…and they got away with it,” Stephen said.There were uncorroborated reports of Sinn Fein security guards turning other mourners away from the cemetery during the funeral. Stephen says the whole thing was a message from Sinn Fein: ‘we run the show’.“That’s what that was: ‘we call shots’. I know people who were given £100 fines for having kids\u0027 birthday parties. Not one fine was given out there.”Mr Irvine added: “Could you imagine a cabinet minister in London going to a similar type of funeral and surviving politically?“We’re at a really dangerous moment here in terms of the political and peace process. I would urge people to think about these things. Mr Irvine said the Good Friday Agreement consolidated the peace deal that predated it but warned: “The bedrock of the political progress here has been shaken to the core”.He expects after lockdown, and with better weather, more people will take to the streets. Against the backdrop of the parading season and tense political situation over the “juggernaut of Brexit”, it could lead to a long, hot summer.“If anybody thinks tinkering around the edges of the protocol to ensure freer access here or there for specific goods is going to be sufficient to deal with the issues, they\u0027re deluding themselves.”“We’re trying to warn people of impending things,” James ‘Jimbo’ Wilson, 69, a former Loyalist internee close to the Red Hand Commando group, said.“Boris Johnson, the Irish government, the American government, and the European government need to sit down and get something sorted.“We might have been paramilitaries in our day, but I’m an old man and most of the leadership in Loyalism would be elderly. We will be pushed to the side and these young lads will go ahead and do what they think is right. Mr Irvine agrees: “There is a prevailing sense in the communities that politics isn\u0027t able to deliver on the solutions required to fix the problems at the moment. Therefore people are resorting to other means.”He describes as “dangerous” former Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney’s reference, during Brexit negotiations, to possible Republican Dissident violence in the event of a hard border. “I don\u0027t think they priced in the reaction because it sent the signal that the threat of violence will be leveraged the threat of violence is the currency that has the greatest value in order to gain advantage in negotiations.“That\u0027s exactly what you\u0027re seeing playing out now. “You\u0027re seeing people saying, ‘it worked for them, it may just work for us’. That’s a very dangerous political trajectory to set any community on.”Loyalist community leaders also worry policing is being politicised in the province. When the Loyalist Communities Council (LCC), an umbrella group for Loyalist paramilitaries formed in 2015, sought a meeting with the PSNI Chief Constable, the Northern Ireland Justice Minister and leader of the centrist Alliance Party, Naomi Long, was “apoplectic” and “openly politically hostile to the police engaging with Loyalism,” Mr Irvine says. In recent years the Alliance Party has taken votes from centrist parties such as the Social Democratic and Labour Party and the Ulster Unionist Party. Mr Irvine says that in order to appeal to centre-left voters targeted by Sinn Fein, the Alliance Party has recently adopted a harder stance towards Loyalism.He contrasts this approach with that taken over the Bobby Storey funeral and says there is no “political cover” for police to engage with Loyalism. “It places the police in an extraordinarily difficult space,” he says.“It’s not straightforward to say Loyalism has lost confidence in the police and the Chief Constable. No matter who the Chief Constable is, the same problems will occur because you have a Justice Minister who has priced in that being hostile to Loyalist communities is a vote winner.“They’re now trying to play the other side of the coin so that they can become the largest party between the green and the orange,” Mr Wilson adds. “You can understand why genuine Loyalists get so frustrated.”A security source in Belfast told the  many Loyalists now viewed the police as a nationalist force and therefore a legitimate target for reprisals.Mr Irvine said Loyalists were the strongest advocates for peace as they have experienced first-hand the consequences “when politics doesn\u0027t deliver”.“The only way we\u0027ll fix this is if we have London, Belfast, Dublin and Brussels on the same page, getting us back in the orbit of the Good Friday Agreement.“We have a short period of time to do that.“We don\u0027t want to see a single person going to prison. We don’t want to see another person get a criminal record. But we also don\u0027t want to see the Union being broken up. Loyalism can\u0027t stand by.“Loyalism needs help, it needs support, and it needs politicians to get real about the problems.”Doug Beattie, Ulster Unionist MLA member for Upper Bann and the man tipped to be the next leader of the party, says people see in the Brexit protocol “that their concerns have been absolutely ignored by the UK government”.It created “sheer anger and frustration,” he said.“Boris Johnson has lied to them he wasn\u0027t up front, he hasn’t told them the truth.”He also criticised Leo Varadkar for showing pictures of a bombed out British army checkpoint on the border. “Every time the EU spoke about violence, they spoke about violence, on the border. “Everybody was only concerned about the frontier between the UK and the EU. They weren\u0027t concerned with violence in Belfast or anywhere else away from the border. That doesn\u0027t affect them. “Those threats of violence, led Boris to the negotiating stance that we\u0027re in.“That\u0027s an awful place to be that governments are either making decisions based on the threat of violence, or they\u0027re making decisions because of violence. “The only way to fix this is if the EU and UK, just stop and look at the mess and realise that, as they beat each other over Brexit, the only people suffering are the people in Northern Ireland.“Whether he stays as Prime Minister is not down to Northern Ireland, it\u0027s going to be down to a vote in England. So his brand of English nationalism is creating a problem. “He is a Prime Minister that could lead to the destruction of our union.“Violence and the threat of violence has returned to Northern Ireland politics.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 public inquiry what","story":"NewsCovid- public inquiry: What the probe will look into and how it will workBoris Johnson confirmed an inquiry into the Governments handling of the Coronavirus pandemic to take place in Spring  - heres what its likely to address and what powers it could havemirrorShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsBoris Johnson confirmed the inquiry today \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Challenged by Keir Starmer over why it could not be begun later this year, Mr Johnson went on: “I think it would be wrong to devote, to consecrate, huge amounts of official time, public health workersapos time, to an inquiry when they may very well be still in the middle of the pandemic.Who will be leading it  That’s yet to be confirmed - Number  says the PM wants to ensure the “right person” is chosen.

The . million lives blighted by Boris Johnson, a man without a plan, are victims of repeated  promises from a Prime Minister cynically breaking pledges in Downing Street and at the General Election. When these people can’t wait until later this year, next year or the year after that, the Government’s betrayal is contemptible and the time for excuses must end. Now. Whether we fund social care through taxation or a levy on inheritances, we want to see the workable proposals. The worry inflicted on the elderly, frail and vulnerable, plus their families, is an ongoing scandal. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  We challenge a twisting Prime Minister to cease neglecting those in most need and care for people who deserve better, much better. How we treat people requiring help is a hallmark of a civilised society. Johnson is failing the test. Quest for truth A coroner has found  people killed in shootings involving British soldiers in Belfast in  were innocent. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace acknowledged the verdict exposed a serious breach of ­discipline by a professional army. In reality this was a massacre and the families’ quest for justice will not end here.  The Troubles in Northern Ireland claimed , lives over  years.

Despite helping to bring eleven children into the world for others desperate to become parents, Danielle-Eve and Daniel Chittenden found out they were unable to have children of their own. Now the couple are now crowdfunding for a round of IVF they hope will finally enable them to have their own child, after a decade. For the last ten years, weaposve not lived. I think weaposve gone on one holiday, and weaposve not gone out on many weekends,” said Danielle-Eve, . Weaposve helped so many other families in that time. Weaposve helped give le to eleven babies and weaposd just like one of our own.For us to know eleven children have been born - six girls and five boys - it rests easy on your heart that you know another couple or single person is not going through the grief and heartache youaposre going through.Danielle-Eve and Daniel, , had always dreamed of having a big family, but after falling pregnant, Danielle-Eve suffered six devastating miscarriages over ten years. The couple decided to help other families conceive too, and Danielaposs sperm donations meant ten people were able to have a total of eleven children.But it wasnapost until Danielle-Eve donated her eggs to help another family, who went on to miscarry, that she was told she would never conceive naturally. The couple, from Whiston, Rotherham, have spent over £, on IVF procedures over the past decade, only to be left disappointed every time. They are now crowdfunding for a round of IVF with a donated egg through GoFundMe, and hope it will bring them their first child. The pair first met on a night out in  and decided to start a family as soon as they got married four years later. It was one of the very first things we ever spoke about. I literally helped raise my nieces and nephews so we have them over quite a lot,” said Danielle-Eve. Children were just a big part of our family le. But after three years of trying with no luck, they knew something was wrong, and were referred to a fertility clinic in Sheffield for help. Back then, I blamed myself because my husband doesnapost have any health conditions but I have PCOS,” Danielle-Eve explained. “I felt very guilty. They had their first fresh cycle of IVF in , but unfortunately it didn’t work. Over the next ten years, the couple self-funded four more IVF and frozen embryo cycles, which all led to pregnancies that sadly never got past  weeks. The procedures cost them over £, of their savings. The last ten years have just gone in the blink of an eye because weaposve not been able to do things other people enjoy,” Danielle-Eve said. Weaposre looking back and I just feel like our last ten years have been on hold because we always thought next year weaposre not going to go on holidayI get pregnant. At the start of every year weaposve not been able to plan what we do.Our hearts have been on hold and our wallets have been on hold. Danielle-Eve did manage to get pregnant twice in , but those pregnancies also resulted in miscarriages - meaning she lost six babies over a ten year period. A little piece of you dies every single time,” she explained. We knew that two of our pregnancies were baby boys - youaposre glad to know, but it hurts that bit more. In , when we were pregnant with twins, we saw and heard their heartbeats. It is especially hard looking back to know it didnapost matter what I did - eat the right things, get the right amount of exercise, it didnapost matter. In , the pair made the decision to try and help other families by donating sperm and eggs. But when Danielle-Eveaposs eggs resulted in a miscarriage for one recipient, it broke her heart.

He says he didn’t think it was important to say anything at the time because we weren’t ‘official’ at that point and my friend has never said a thing to me in the three years since it happened. I’m not sure what to think to be honest, but it’s definitely taken the shine off the wedding planning for me.

They killed at least  people, including Fredaposs ex-we and their children, after discovering their shared sickening sexual desires.Many of their victims remains were not discovered for decades, and this week police have begun digging at a cafe in the search for the coupleaposs first suspected victimOfficers have “potentially important evidence” linked to Mary Bastholm, who vanished in Gloucester in  aged . Fred is believed to have confessed his involvement in Mary’s disappearance to his son Stephen while in prison awaiting trial – but he killed himself in  aged  before he could face justice.  The twisted killer, who started his murder spree in , was eventually arrested at his family home in Cromwell Street, Gloucester, in . It was soon dubbed the aposhouse of horrorsapos as police found body parts buried in the garden and hidden in the walls. They also found Fred and Roseaposs tools of their torture buried alongside the bodies. Forensic psychologist Dr Julian Boon said: The thing that haunts me the most was a mask that had nothing but two nose holes so the person can breathe but they canapost see or hear. As a consequence they could have anything done to them and that is very frightening. The house at  Cromwell Street was just minutes from a busy shopping centre but the layout of the home, with a side entrance and little street lighting, meant Fred and Rose could get their victims in almost undetected.  Then, they would lead them into the torture chamber they had created in the basement. Criminal profiler Dr Paul Britton said: These arenapost people who looked like predatory psychopaths, they looked ordinary. Their activities were out of plain sight. They were able to take their victims , bind them, gag them, break their teeth. They were able to put tubes into them to keep them alive for days and suspend them from hooks because of the nature of the building. They were shielded and no one knew what was happening. Fred was charged with  murders and in  his we was convicted of . She is serving a le sentence and will die behind bars.

It has long been rumoured Fred knew the youngster as he often visited the Pop In cafe where she worked. Rose’s former solicitor, Leo Goatley, claims tragic Mary could have been the couple’s first murder together.  He told the Mirror said: “I think there is evidence the Mary Bastholm murder was [Rose’s] ­initiation into the whole thing. It is not like the Pop In cafe was not on the police radar right from the start. “In fact I believe they have been in there before but without clear evidence could not pull a going business apart. “I think Mary was a sore point because there was so much compelling evidence that Fred and even Rose West were involved in her disappearance. I just hope the police do find ­something that finally gives closure for the surviving members of Mary’s family.”  - Catherine Rena Costello,  Catherine, who later became a mum of two and was known as Rena, married Frederick West at Ledbury Registry Office on November , .

When police dug up the cellar at Cromwell Street they found Lucy’s bones along with the rope used to tie her up, two hairgrips, a few strands of hair and the masking tape still gaging her.  - Carol Cooper,  The teenager grew up in care following her motheraposs death in .

Kate and Gerry McCann still hope she will be found alive,  years after she vanished on holiday in Portugal in , days before her fourth birthday. They said in a poignant message: “We love you and are waiting for you.” Devoted Kate and Gerry marked daughter Madeleine’s th birthday on Wednesday by leaving cards and gts in her room, untouched since she vanished  years ago. The couple posted a photo of her on the Find Madeleine campaign Facebook page, writing alongside it: “Happy th birthday Madeleine.  “We love you and we’re waiting for you and we’re never going to give up.” Kate, , and Gerry, , had asked pals to mark the day in a low-key manner. The Facebook post came a week after they marked the “particularly poignant” th anniversary of her disappearance. Madeleine went missing from her family’s holiday apartment in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz days before her fourth birthday in May .  Prosecutors want to question German paedophile Christian Brueckner over her disappearance and claim to have evidence that she is dead. But Kate and Gerry, , of Rothley, Leics, refuse to give up hope that Madeleine is still alive and will one day be found. In another post on the Find Madeleine page last week they said they “need to know what happened to our lovely daughter”. Scotland Yard’s hunt for Madeleine’s abductor continues, with four detectives still working on Operation Grange.  A top-level summit between German, British and Portuguese detectives is due to take place in Lisbon this summer. The Mirror revealed in January that cops are launching a push to find the “missing piece of the jigsaw” that could snare Brueckner. German and Portuguese investigators are to carry out new interviews of key witnesses in the Algarve who knew him. Brueckner, , was named as the prime suspect for Madeleine’s disappearance by German prosecutors last June.  They believe he abducted and killed the three-year-old. He is currently serving a seven-year term in a prison in Hanover for raping a pensioner in Praia da Luz in . His lawyer Friedrich Fulscher insists the German has nothing to do with the youngster’s disappearance. Last week the couple posted on Facebook: “Every May is tough – a reminder of years passed, of years together lost, or stolen.  “This year it is particularly poignant as we should be celebrating Madeleine’s th birthday. Enough said. “The Covid pandemic has made this year even more dficult for many reasons but thankfully the investigation to find Madeleine and her abductor has continued. “We hang on to the hope, however small, that we will see Madeleine again. “As we have said repeatedly, we need to know what has happened to our lovely daughter, no matter what.

Chloe was the eldest among the  children Sue, , and her husband Noel, , had still living at home, They are parents to Chris, , Sophie, , Chloe, , Jack, , Daniel, , Luke, , Millie, , Katie, , James, , Ellie, , Aimee, , Josh, , Max, , Tillie, , Oscar, nine, Casper, eight, Hallie, five, Phoebe, four, Archie, three, Bonnie, two, Heidie, one, and also baby Alfie, who was sadly still born on July , .  The couple might have expected their home to be a little quieter now there are  children left living there. But Sue said on their Youtube channel that there had been “bedroom wars” as a result, with the other older children now bidding for the room. “We’ve had bedroom wars between Katie and Luke,” Sue said. “We decided Katie was probably better having it as there is four in that bedroom and only James and Luke in the bedroom at the front.” She also said she had urged Chloe to take things slowly with her boyfriend Jake, and to live with him and his mum before buying a house.  “Last weekend when we were away in Center Parcs Chloe moved in with her boyfriend which was a big deal,” Sue explained. “She wants to get a mortgage but I said instead of jumping in and getting a mortgage together before you’ve lived together, please live together and seeyou like each other and get on really well. “It’s a big dealyou then realise actually living together you don’t get on too well.” Chloe was still living at the family’s ten-bedroom home in Morecambe, Lancashire, before then.  Sue and Noel’s two eldest, Chris, , and Sophie, , had already moved out to start their own families.After making the move, make-up artist Chloe announced on Instagram : “Few drinks to celebrate LIVING together!”Tagging Jake, she added: “...might need something a bit stronger than a pint.” The news came as Sue and Noel announced they were expecting another grandchild, their seventh so far. The new baby will be born to Chris, who already has two children, Maisie, three, and Jacob, one, in September. Sue and Noel’s other grandkids are Daisy, eight, Ayprill, six, and Leo, five, who were born to their daughter Sophie, , and her husband Joe Broadley. Their daughter Millie, , gave birth to baby Ophelia in September, and she still lives in the family’s home in Morecambe, Lancashire. Sue and Noel revealed how excited they were for the new baby, posting on their main account: “Another beautul grandson on the way.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum 25 told huge breast","story":"NewsMum, , told huge breast tumour was blocked milk duct laughed when finally diagnosedEXCLUSIVE: Beccie Lopez, , from Gravesend, Kent, had just given birth to her first child when she noticed a large lump and dimpling of the skin on her right breastmirrorShareCommentsByRyan MerrieldReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsBeccie Lopez ignored the breast lump for months \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But months later she could feel a large lump that remained for several weeks, and she began to grow concerned. “When I was looking at myself and I flattened my skin I could see it,” Beccie told the Mirror. “I got my mum to come and have a feel and she could see the dimpling of the skin and she said aposyou need to ring the doctor ASAPapos.” Beccie rang her GP the next day and as soon as she mentioned the dimpling of the skin she said she was referred to hospital straight away, due to it being a common sign of aggressive cancer.Are you going through a similar journey to Beccie  Let us know at webnews@mirror “Thankfully, mine wasnapost aggressive. But it was growing fast, it was a grade ,” Beccie, from Gravesend, Kent, explained. She said even the nurses were shocked when tests confirmed it was cancer, partly due to her age and the fact she has no history of the disease in her family. “Just like everyone  they thought it was a blocked milk duct and thataposs what I thought it was going to be,” she explained. Recalling when she was told, she said: “I walked into the room, there was five nurses there...they said aposIaposm sorry, itaposs not looking goodapos.  “At the time I laughed, Iaposm the sort of person I donapost know how to be when itaposs that sort of thing. Do I laugh or do I cry  “They kept talking to me, and I said to them aposIaposm not taking anything in youaposre saying to meapos, I just wanted to get out. “But they have to go through it. The little bits about whataposs going to happen next. “Obviously, they didnapost know what stage it was or anything like that, so my first question was aposam I going to die apos “Thataposs all I cared about. Iaposve got a little boy. I turned  in September and found out in February, and I thought this sort of thing canapost be happening.”  In the time since first beginning tests, Beccie developed almost all of the telltale signs, including an inverted nipple, a change in her skin and the shape of her breast, and shooting pains. Within four weeks of diagnosis she had her mastectomy, where the tumour and seven swollen lymph nodes were removed. These came back clear following a biopsy, confirming the cancer hadnapost spread to them. But during surgery a second cancerous growth was found next to the first, which was removed along with the right breast. Beccie must now wait months for a second mastectomy to remove the left breast, as well as reconstruction work due to delays brought about by the Covid pandemic. She is due start chemotherapy this month.  “The whole thing has been surreal. Even to this day, itaposs still so surreal,” she said. “It feels even when I look down and Iaposve not got my breast anymore it doesnapost feel real.” She said prior to her diagnosis she had googled her symptoms and was ready to hear the worst. “I went in there prepared to be told it was either a benign tumour but Iaposve got to have surgery, or cancer,” she added. She continued: “Iaposve accepted it now. I feel quite well, to be fair. I think that might change when my hair starts to fall out and I start to go through chemotherapy, thataposs when itaposs going to feel real to me.” In the meantime, Beccie is in a race against time to complete fertility treatment before chemo starts on May .

Irene Payne raised a glass of bubbly to toast her first time outdoors in more than a year. Care home staff arranged the surprise reunion with her daughter Sandra Pocock, , after the great-great gran was forced apart from her family due to the pandemic. An emotional Irene can be heard exclaiming hello sweetheart as she spotted her daughter outside Fernhill House, Worcester. Ireneaposs carer wheeled her through the home and she was applauded by staff who formed a guard of honour, complete with balloons and confetti.  BirminghamLive reports how the delighted pair clinked glasses and enjoyed a short walk around her village to give Irene her first taste of freedom since February last year.She is seen enjoying the emotional reunion and shouting Cheers everyone! as she toasted her carers and family. Retired nurse Irene moved into the care home following a hip injury and was unable to see her family properly until Covid restrictions were recently eased.  Sandra, of Chippenham, Wilts., said: The home rang me last Wednesday to askI would like to take mum out because of the Covid restrictions being relaxed and go out for a short walk. “Obviously I was over the moon to take her. I went in on Thursday, had my tests like I always do and they brought mum out to me. “She was completely unaware that it was going to happen. “They were clapping her out, there were balloons and a confetti shower and glasses of fizz for me to hold out to her. She does enjoy a glass of wine, so it was fantastic to celebrate with her.  “Mum was just overwhelmed, it was amazing. She had no idea, so it was a total surprise and really lovely. “Then I took her round the village which was really nice because she hadn’t been able to see the area since moving  months ago. “She was delighted to see the trees, be in the fresh air and hear the birds singing. It was just bliss. “It was wonderful to see her smiley face.

Emily Barratt and her husband purchased the £, property in Middleton in January , when it was in dire need of an upgrade. The building was in a poor state, with the previous owners’ belongings strewn across the house, as well as a leaking roof and battered old windows which desperately needed to be replaced. We lived in a very small cottage built in  prior to this, so I was keen to have lots of space. I saw so much potential with this big, beautul building that had such a lovely history, and thought it would make the perfect family home,” explained Emily, who works as a pottery artist.  The -year-old took time off work to focus on doing up the house, as well as home schooling seven-year-old Minnie and six-year-old Rory throughout the pandemic. Emily, who hails from Rochdale, had help from builders to fix the leak in the roof, fit  new windows and knocking down the wall between the kitchen and the dining room, before she embarked on the rest of the renovations all by herself. She began by pulling down the ceiling in the master bedroom to expose the original church beams, before plastering the remainder of the rooms and moving onto the aesthetics and transforming them one by one.  The hardest part was tiling the floors and laying the carpets. I taught myself to do both, but they are quite physical and Iaposm not the strongest person out there,” Emily said. “I do DIY every day, including painting, tiling and upcycling furniture.” She added: I did all the ling and wallpapering myself and also sanded all the beams in our bedroom. I also painted the outside the house - but I still have a few other sides left to do. I love DIY, I find it really addictive and Iaposll give anything a go other than electrics.  The kitchen, which turned out to be the most expensive thanks to all new appliances, was transformed from dark flooring and old fashioned cabinets to having sleek stone flooring and all modern countertops. Meanwhile, the bathroom has also been completely modernised with black, white and grey tiles, a claw-foot tub, and a walk-in shower. Elsewhere in the home, the bedrooms have all been totally revamped, including the childrenaposs rooms which are now colourful and exciting, while being tailored to each of their personalities.  But, once all the bedrooms were sorted, Emily turned her attention to creating the family’s very own gym, in place of what used to be an old bedroom. Elsewhere, she turned a dinghy old garage into a luxurious, fully stocked bar with cool lighting and an area for live music. While the house isn’t finished just yet, Emily recently had someone come and value the home, which is now worth an eyewatering £, - £, more than it was purchased for.

As paramedics worked in vain to save her le her mobile rang as the school called to ask why she was running late to pick up her child, a witness to the horric crash claims. Police are quizzing  -year-old driver arrested on suspicion of the murder of Mrs Shehzad, who died less than  yards from her home.The mum died when a grey Citroen C ploughed into her near a junction in the neighbourhood, police say. A man who raced to the scene after hearing the crash described a bloodbath, as the victim was carried on the bonnet before the vehicle crashed into boulders beside a grassed area and she was catapulted -ft, hitting a tree head-first. A -year-old man was arrested a short time later, West Yorkshire Police said. Mrs Shehzadi, has an -year-old son, along with two boys and two girls. She was taking her usual daily route to pick up the youngest, her seven-year-old daughter, when she was killed at pm. Uzmat Munir, , a bank employee, was working from his home overlooking the grassed area on Monday afternoon when he heard a massive bang. “I saw the lady laying face down on the grass next to the tree. The car was empty and smashed into the rocks, he said. “My neighbour called an ambulance and we tried to help the lady, but none of us knew CPR. “There was about five of us stood around, not knowing what to do. A woman came before the ambulance arrived and turned her over and tried to revive her, but the poor lady was obviously dead.There was blood flowing from her mouth and a head wound - it was a bloodbath. “The car had hit her, carried on the bonnet and after it hit the rocks, she had flown into the tree. It looked like she had hit her head on the tree.”  Flowers have since laid below the tree, and police remained in the area on Wednesday. Mr Munir added:“I heard that whilst the paramedics tried to resuscitate the woman, her mobile phone rang, and it was the school ringing to let her know she was late picking her kid up.” The victimaposs neighbour Rukhsana Kausar, , said: ”She lived with her husband and five children and was devoted to her children. “Iram had gone to pick up her young daughter, like she does every day at that time, and this terrible thing has happened.” Rehana Nawaz, , who lives on the street where the mum was hit, said: ”I heard a lot of noise and thought it was a fight at first. “I went down and saw her laying down on the ground, face down. I asked a couple of guys standing there to roll her over onto her back. “You could see she had a massive injury to the right side of her head and there was a lot of blood coming from her mouth. “My sister-in-law, who is a teacher and knows CPR, tried about  compressions and then the ambulance arrived. “At first I thought she had been the driver of the car and I saw car keys on the ground beside the vehicle, but the I was told by someone there that the driver had run off. “One of the men who was first on the scene had held her hand and she looked at him as she took her last breath and passed away. “She took that same route every day at the same time to pick up her little girl.” Haris, Mrs Shehzadi’s nephew, said: “It has hit the family, especially her children, really hard. “She was a very good lady who always kept herself to herself. She has helped everybody out. She had a lot of respect from the area. “I used to live near her and see her every day going to pick up her kids from school. “The family are going to be traumatised, she did not deserve this at all.” Another relative said: I went to pay my respects to her husband yesterday and he is still in shock. He still thinks she is coming back, it hasnapost sunk in yet.

But a small handful of areas are currently experiencing a jump in cases, pushing rates back to levels last seen earlier this year. While rates in these areas have yet to reach levels recorded at the peak of the second wave, the latest figures suggest localised outbreaks of Covid- are continuing to occur, driven by a range of factors.Here are the areas currently seeing a rise in rates of coronavirus. Erewash - Derbyshire: . cases per , people Erewash in Derbyshire currently has the highest case rates of any local area in the UK. A total of  new cases were recorded in the seven days to May  - the equivalent of . per , people, up from . in the previous week and the highest for the area since February . The sharp rise in case rates has been driven by an outbreak at Wilsthorpe Academy in the town of Long Eaton, according to Derbyshire County Councilaposs director for public health, Dean Wallace. The signicant outbreak of Covid- at Wilsthorpe Academy continues to affect case numbers in the area, he said on Tuesday. As Covid rates across Derbyshire have been relatively low, any increase in numbers can have a large impact on the figures for that area. I understand this will cause concern, but Iaposd like to reassure residents that we continue to work closely with the school and Public Health England to minimise the spread. The school remained closed last week, but is due to reopen in stages this week. There is no evidence that the outbreak is a new iant of Covid- or a iant of concern, Mr Wallace added.  Moray - north-east Scotland: . cases per , people Moray currently has the highest rate in Scotland, with  new cases of Covid- recorded in the seven days to May . This is the equivalent of . cases per , people - down slightly on the previous few days, but still at a level not recorded in the area since the end of January. Scotlandaposs chief medical officer, Dr Gregor Smith, said the outbreak is thought to consist of  signicant networks, with infections in a number of settings including schools, workplaces and large shops. The towns of Elgin and Keith are particular hotspots, he said, but there does not appear to be a spread into neighbouring local authorities such as the Highlands and Aberdeenshire.  Genome sequencing indicates that the Moray outbreak consists of the B strain of Covid- - the iant that first emerged in Kent in late  and which is now dominant in the UK. The demographic of those testing positive is slightly younger than overall, he said, adding: Weaposve had, unfortunately, some hospital admissions for older age groups as a consequence of this outbreak as well. National clinical director Jason Leitch confirmed that the outbreak appears to have slowed in recent days, but officials are still monitoring the situation. Bolton - Greater Manchester: . cases per , people Bolton in Greater Manchester has the second highest rate in the UK, with  new cases of coronavirus recorded in the seven days to May . The rate has jumped from . to . in a week - the highest since the seven days to February . Surge testing has been under way in parts of Bolton since May , after Public Health Englandconfirmed the town is one of the main locations for cases of the India iant of Covid-, which last week was reclassied as a iant of concern.  Cases of the India iant in England had increased from  to  as of May , PHE said, with almost half related to travel or contact with a traveller. The majority of the cases are concentrated in two areas: north-west England, predominantly Bolton, and London. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has submitted a request to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation that all over-s in Bolton, along with the rest of the Greater Manchester area, are able to receive a Covid- vaccination to mitigate the risks of spread in those communities where we are seeing more transmission.

Former councillor Jackie Earl says its outside tables are too close to her home. There is six-foot wall between her property and the courtyard but her home overlooks the increasingly busy outside space. The grandmother-of-seven has invested a lot of money and effort into renovating her own home in line with conservation area rules. She believes her privacy had been infringed by the courtyard’s use. And she was shocked with the way the bar had gone about the change and quietly introduced the outside seating. She told Gazettelive : You wouldn’t believe it. I can touch an umbrella from my garden wall.“I’ve lived here all my le and I’ve no issue with people making money out of it. “We had a newsagent’s for more than  years, so I understand all about businesses. “But not having this three feet from your house.” Her own home is renovated according to the market town of Yarmaposs own conservation area rules. But the wine bar, called Fourteen Drops in Stockton, County Durham, put tables at the back to serve customers during lockdown.  Pubs and restaurants will only be allowed to serve people who are sitting outside until May  when lockdown rules are relaxed further. They’ve ridden roughshod over us really, it’s an entitlement thing. WhatI’d gone and done that in front of their house  They wouldn’t like a pop up bar.  The bar was allowed to put the tables out after getting ‘temporary event notices according to reports. A council spokesman said: We’ve taken a flexible approach to supporting businesses as they get back on their feet, and Fourteen Drops was recently granted a Temporary Events Notice allowing use of the rear courtyard.

Well not anymore, as a chef has shared a recipe that requires no scales at all.Chloe regularly shares simple-to-follow recipes on her TikTok where sheaposs known as @chloescookbook, such as how to make creamy mac and cheese, Yorkshire puddings and flavoursome burgers.But itaposs her super easy yoghurt cake recipe thataposs racked up almost one million views. Despite Chloe claiming itaposs the easiest cake youaposll ever make, itaposs caused quite the stir as some people were horried by the amount of sugar and oil she used.  Chloe explains that to measure out your ingredients, youaposll need a pot of yoghurt. After tipping the pot of yoghurt into a bowl she fills it to the top with oil, she then adds three eggs, which she whisks, before adding two pots of sugar and three pots full of self-raising flour. But she does warn that the flavour of yoghurt you use will determine what the cake will taste like so choose wisely. Once mixed, she places it into an oven preheated at  degrees for  minutes - and then itaposs ready to serve. Since being posted, the video has racked up more than , likes and  comments.  Whilst Chloe was flooded with praise by the majority of viewers, a few people branded the cake bad for you because of how much oil and sugar she used. One person said: We make this in Spain all the time, the oil is always Olive Oil though. Also use lemon yogurt for a zingy result, as another viewer from France said they do the same, adding: You can make it chocolate with Nesquick powder. Someone  said: THIS LOOKS SO GOOD. And itaposs simple too!

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeAt least .million lives could have been saved during the Covid- crisis, which has been labelled a apospreventable pandemicapos in a scathing piece of research. A lack of international leadership, an eight-day delay in declaring a global emergency and reluctance to impose travel restrictions are among the key findings by an independent report commissioned by the World Health Organisation. Calling for wide-ranging reforms to the WHO and for an international council to be established to transform preparation and response, the report lays out bold measures to make the current global crisis the last pandemic. The situation we find ourselves in today could have been prevented,  co-chair Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said at the launch of the report. It is due to a myriad of failures, gaps and delays in preparedness and response.Here are the key errors that created a toxic cocktail for the spread of coronavirus.Eight-day delay in declaring global emergency Chinese authorities first confirmed they were treating dozens of cases of pneumonia sparked by an unknown cause in Wuhan on December , . At the time, there was no evidence the virus could be rapidly spread by humans, but the report suggests the World Health Organisation was slow to act as the disease gained momentum.  “Clinicians in Wuhan acted quickly when they recognised iniduals in a cluster of pneumonia cases that were not normal,” said Sirleaf, adding that the alert was quickly picked up by neighbouring countries and the media. “This shows the benefit and speed of open-source reporting, but then the systems that were meant to validate and respond to this alert were too slow. The alert system does not operate with sufficient speed when faced with a fast-moving respiratory pathogen.” The report suggests the World Health Organisation was hindered by regulations that need rethinking and should have declared a global health emergency by January  - eight days before it eventually did so.On January , a -year-old woman suffering a fever, cough and sore throat arrived from Wuhan in the UK, before being confirmed as Britainaposs first coronavirus case.By the time a global emergency was declared, the virus has already spread to countries including Thailand and the US, with around  confirmed cases and  reported dead. aposLost monthapos of February Following the declaration, however, the report suggests too many countries were slow to act and tighten their borders, meaning February was a lost month in the fight against the virus. If travel restrictions had been imposed more quickly, more widely, again that would have been a serious inhibition on the rapid transmission of the disease, said the aposs co-chair Helen Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand.  New Zealandaposs quick response to the virus was hailed as an early success story in the pandemic, with the nation currently reporting only  Covid deaths since the outbreak began. On February , a man in the Philippines became the first person outside China to die of Covid-. New Zealand banned entries to any foreigners coming from or through the country, while forcing nationals ing from there to isolate for  days. The UKaposs response was less severe. Between January and March , Britain imposed quarantine measures on  people travelling from Wuhan, while asking travellers from high-risk countries including China, Iran and Northern Italy to voluntarily isolate for  days. However, these self-isolation requirements were withdrawn on March  -  days before the UK went into lockdown. The report adds: “Countries with the ambition to aggressively contain and stop the spread whenever and wherever it occurs have shown that this is possible. Reckless leaders aposdevalued scienceapos International leaders who devalued science have also been criticised by the study, which claims they denied the potential impact of the pandemic, delayed comprehensive action, and allowed distrust to undermine efforts.Arguably the most high profile example was former US president Donald Trump, who was widely rebuked for his downplaying of and outright denial of the virus.In January , after the first Covid case in the US was confirmed, he said: “It’s one person coming in from China. We have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.” The next month he boasted, It’s going to disappear. One day – it’s like a miracle – it will disappear, later prompting outcry for suggesting the virus could be combated by injecting bleach.  The US currently has recorded , Covid deaths, the highest rate in the world, followed by Brazil on , deaths. Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro infamously railed against other nationaposs lockdown measures as the pandemic unfolded, saying of the virus: Itaposs just a little flu or the snfles. Speaking in late March , he stood firm against calls for tougher measures, insisting: “Our lives have to go on. Jobs must be kept... We must, yes, get back to normal. The countryaposs slow vaccination rollout has since seen Bolsonaroaposs regime accused of “homicidal negligence” by the Brazilian press. Sceptical leaders from nations also including Tanzania and Turkmenistan - whose president suggested a herb could keep the virus at bay - were dubbed the aposostrich allianceapos for burying their heads in the sand. aposWinner takes allapos battle for PPE Many nations were unprepared for a pandemic and only spurred into action when hospital ICU beds began to fill, said Clark. She added: By then it was too late to avert the pandemicaposs impact. What followed then was a winner takes all scramble for PPE and therapeutics. Globally, health workers were tested to their limits and the rates of infection, illness and death soared and continue to soar.” Last May, the Mirror told how doctors completely ran out of essential items of PPE while fighting on the NHS frontline.One ICU doctor working at a London hospital said: “I have had to treat patients without a gown on because we have completely run out. Just my scrubs, with gloves and a mask. “One member of staff has stopped coming to work because her mum has Type  diabetes and without PPE, she’s terried she’ll infect her. I often find myself standing in front of a patient, knowing I’m not protected enough.”A report by thealso found that government stockpiles containing protective equipment for healthcare workers in the event of a pandemic fell in value by almost  per cent in the six years up to .aposPandemic of inequalityapos The aposs experts warn that Covid- has been a pandemic of inequality, exacerbated between and within countries. The crisis has been particularly devastating in impoverished nations like India, where tens of millions of residents have been plunged into poverty since the outbreak.

Turning to his companion Rick Stanton, the er assumed it was the odour of rotting corpses - in fact, it belonged to a rather pungent make-sht toilet spot a mile inside the cavernous Thai cave they were desperately searching. If youaposve got to pick something to smell, itaposs much better to have that and see  Thai kids alive, quips the -year-old now. It was just one of the countless surreal moments in a rescue mission that gripped the world, as everyone from the US military to Elon Musk piled in to save the Wild Boars soccer team trapped against a rising tide. A world-renowned cave er for  years, John and two fellow Brits were parachuted in to spearhead the operation - battling against insurmountable odds to retrieve the entire group alive and well. In his new book, Thirteen Lessons That Saved Thirteen Lives, John reveals the nail-biting moments that left him preparing for the worst - from sedating the boys with ketamine to the exhausting swim for survival. aposI imagined bumping into bodiesapos John first realised his services were in order when he read the story on BBC news:  young soccer players and their coach had become trapped in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave after venturing in for an initiation ceremony on June , . Contacting fellow Brit Vernon Unsworth, who was already at the scene, John and Rick flew out to Thailand - but the operation was already growing out of control. When we arrived there was a fair bit of chaos, says John. Lots of organisations were milling round, nobody actually seemed to know what they had to do. On top of that, the water had been rising steadily, advancing towards the entrance to the cave.  Earning the trust of the US military who were plotting the mission alongside the Thai Navy Seals, the Brits took a step back and assessed their options. With the water reaching dangerously high levels, there was little to do but wait for days until they could enter the cave. As the press poured in from across the globe, the forces on the ground contemplated the grim reality of the situation - with the flooding so severe, there was little chance the football team would be alive. I tend to do a lot of visualisations, says John, from Bristol, who has previously carried out cave ing missions in body recovery. In my mind I had run through crawling underwater upstream against the flow, reaching a swirling point of the cave and quite literally bumping into childrenaposs bodies, imagining how they might spin in the flow. Itaposs a macabre thing to do, but Iaposd rather ready myself for it ahead of time than find it and be unprepared for it. Itaposs a case of hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst. During their first expedition into the cave, however, John and Rick were surprised to come across another team - four Thai water workers who had become trapped during an earlier rescue attempt. Quickly deciding to take them to safety, the Brits tucked the workers under their arms in a manoeuvre John likens to an underwater wrestling match. Yet the bizarre discovery paled in comparison to what they found next. aposFinding them alive  That was the easy partapos On July  - a week since the alarm was raised - the waters had finally reached a safe enough level for John and Rick to search the cave further. Venturing a mile in, the pair eventually emerged into an opening. At first, they were hit by the terrible smell - but then noticed flashes of light bouncing around the pitch-black chamber. They had found the Wild Boars.  Armed with cameras to record the journey and provide proof of le, Rick inspected the faces in complete disbelief. I hadnapost expected all the children to survive. I wanted to capture the faces of those who were alive so we could work out who was not, he explains. Once we finished filming, we counted to  and they were all alive. Unbelievable. On the video, as I start climbing the mud bank where theyaposre sheltering, thereaposs a funny moment where I say a couple of times aposbelieveapos. Iaposm just trying to convince myself that the situation really is real. When the news broke of the boysapos survival, millions breathed a sigh of relief. But John couldnapost afford to be so complacent - he knew the hardest leg of their journey was yet to come. What we were trying to do had never been done before, he says. Itaposs almost unimaginable in a modern western society that you can have  happy, smiley children that are beyond help. Yet, Iaposve always known that in cave ing explorations, you can be beyond a long, flooded section of cave and you can be alive there, but youaposre slowly dying. Thereaposs no way of sustaining le. To explain that concept is quite dficult, as people didnapost want to hear that. Because weaposd found them, people seemed to think it was a done deal. Really, it hadnapost been started. Emerging back alone from the cave, the ers began plotting how to rescue the team and their coach. John knew thatthey stayed there much longer, with oxygen quickly depleting, not one of them would survive.  While the experts ignored the buzz of the international media, hundreds of offers of help were coming from all corners of the globe. Notably, one such offer was from Tesla founder Elon Musk, who rang them suggesting he could supply a small submarine to assist the operation. John, a self-confessed fan of the billionaireaposs work, urged his colleagues to hear him out. I said to Rick, aposThis is a person with almost limitless resources. We would be foolish to turn down this assistance.apos It seemed thatanyone was going to pull of some sort of wild card, he had the experience, the money and the engineering to do so. Ultimately it wasnapost something that would have been useful. But there were hundreds of people offering suggestions andyou have to pick someone thataposs credible, he was probably very high up on that list.Muskaposs involvement took a infamous turn once his help was turned down. The billionaire took to Twitter calling Vernon a pedo guy, leading to a highly-publicised defamation suit he eventually won.I wasnapost involved in the name calling and stuff that happened afterwards, says John. It was a shame really as it detracted from the whole rescue mission. Boys drugged with ketamine The ersapos previous rescue of the water workers had taught them one key lesson as they made preparations to retrieve the soccer team. Even in that short journey back, the workers had struggled against the water and risked losing sight of the navigation line. The solution was a sobering one: the boys would have to be sedated.  We knew that there was no way we could bring the boys out conscious through a mile of flooded passage, says John. At some point they would panic, and that had been underlined by bringing these adult male water workers from what was perhaps  metres of passage. Bringing in expert anaesthetist Richard Harris, the team were armed with a mixture of ketamine, xanax and atropine. The rescue mission was ready to go. aposWe put them underwater - and they stopped breathingapos Emerging in the cave chamber, John was handed the responsibility of bringing three of the children to safety. Initially believing they might be semi-conscious for the journey, he now knew he would have to carry them completely unconscious. Upon administering the drugs, however, they were faced with a terrying moment before the journey had even begun.  When we put the childrenaposs faces underwater they stopped breathing for a period of time, says John. Perhaps it was the cold water, but they would tense up, then start relaxing. I certainly had an issue with my second lad where he stopped breathing for some period of time. Itaposs not a good situation to be in. Youaposve got a healthyish child and because youaposre so far from help, youaposre on your own. Feeling completely exhausted after days of non-stop preparations, the er admits at that moment he desperately wanted it to be over. Strapping on the childrenaposs masks, though, he broke the journey ahead into small checkpoints in his mind - then took the plunge. I was overwhelmingly tired and as is often the case with dficult things in all walks of le, the whole problem is too much to think about, John says of the journey back. I tend to break things down into small chunks and itaposs just a case of moving forwards, one step at a time and ticking those little jobs off. The visibility is often so bad that you canapost see the child youaposre carrying. Youaposve got one hand on the line, youaposre cradling the child under your chest. The only way you know theyaposre still alive is that you can feel bubbles rising from the regulator attached to their mask.  The eyes of the world were fixated on the ers, but John says he simply focused on the three boys under his care. If there was a mistake to be made on this mission, he vowed, it wouldnapost be his. Swimming through what he describes as cold coffee, he took care to guide the unconscious childrenaposs bodies while not disturbing their masks, which could have led to them drowning on the spot. Just metres from the exit, he came across a heart-stopping problem. I suddenly had a moment quite close to the end of the e where suddenly the child wouldnapost move forwards, says John. In the poor visibility I had to park him on the bottom and feel down the side of his body, looking for a reason why he wouldnapost move forwards. I found a piece of old telephone wire that had wound round one of his legs, so I had to cut that. All of this is done in visibility of perhaps six inches. Played by Colin Farrell in Hollywood blockbuster The final result was a triumph against all odds. By July , all  boys and the coach were rescued alive and taken to hospital for treatment. Reflecting on his teamaposs success, John admits his own sense of relief was in being able to hold my head up high - albeit in typically macabre fashion.

He attacks the ball impressively with timing and aggression.There’s been a few occasions where defences have had to change things during games to deal with him and still not succeeded.When there is the kind of delivery Charlie Adam and Paul McGowan are sending in, there is always a chance.And that’s why I wouldn’t be surprisedthe key goals come from Ashcroft or his defensive partner Liam Fontaine.Of the two options I thought the manager might consider, I’d expect these matches to be tight.And Dundee have shown lately how much of a threat they are from set-pieces.When Raith saw off Dundee so impressively in January, the Dark Blues were missing both Fontaine and Ashcroft so having them in defence will be vital.I think they’d be delighted to copy Raith’s lead last week and come back from the home leg with a battling - to set up a second-leg showdown at Dens on Saturday.Saturday’s big cup clash was a real disappointment for Dundee United, there’s no hiding from that.Their performance was pretty lacklustre and Hibs deserved to go through, evenit took an offside goal to secure victory.It’s been a good cup run but it ended in a pretty disappointing manner.Had they created a load of chances, played well but got beaten then you could say fair enough.But I think the players will be pretty frustrated at the way they played.This was a real chance to win the Scottish Cup so they’ll be annoyed at that, you don’t get too many opportunities.But, it’s still been a decent season overall.It’s just a shame it’s pretty much over now.The Tangerines still have two league games left to play and manager Micky Mellon will be wanting them to finish on a positive note.However, I’d expect it might be a dficult one for some of the players to pick themselves back up for.Motherwell and St Mirren to come – a fight to see who finishes sixth, seventh or eighth.If I was the manager, I’d be looking to give some young players a chance.They’ll be hungry to impress and,they do, could end up being like two or three new signings ahead of next season.It’s all about focusing on the positives now for Mellon and his Terrors.A League Cup in the bag already and now a Scottish Cup Final for St Johnstone – the job Callum Davidson has done there is unreal.If he leads them to two cup wins in one season it will have been an unbelievable season for the Perth club.Seeing them at the start of the campaign, they looked like a team that would be hovering just above the relegation battle.However, they’ve got stronger and are now a well-oiled machine and really dficult to play against.No disrespect to St Johnstone but it is amazing considering the budget they work on. Dundee have given themselves a serious advantage in play-off promotion push says former frontman Simon Murray\"

picturesque Fe golf club, wrecking a putting green and furniture and causing £, worth of damage.Club officials at Balbirnie Park Golf Club in Markinch opened on Sunday to find a number of bins ripped from walls and crushed, one of the greens damaged and furniture missing.The incident happened at the Balbirnie Park Golf Course sometime between pm on Saturday and .am on Sunday.An estimated £, worth of damage was caused across the course with the greens, and associated fixtures and fittings being targeted.Greenkeepers were called in to conduct an emergency repair in order for the club to remain open.The incidents are the latest in a spate of vandalism and anti-social behaviour suffered by the club in recent months, prompting club officials to call for increased police patrols of the area in a bid to deter further damage.Club captain, George Allan, said the club had suffered numerous incidents, despite increasing security at the course.He said: “It’s hugely frustrating for the club’s staff who work tirelessly to keep the course in top condition.“Saturday’s damage included bins ripped from the walls, which were crushed and then dug into the turf on one of our green.“I’m at a loss to see how anyone can get pleasure out of such destruction.“Our greenkeepers had to undertake an emergency repair and did a great job so members could continue playing.“Tee markers and flags have also gone missing, while furniture was also removed which all has to be replaced at a cost to the club.“I’ve confronted a few youths regarding but they just laugh and walk off, they have no respect for the club or its members.“We’ve had continuing problems with petty vandalism for months and are to meet with the police this week to discuss ways in which they and us can stop further vandalism.”Inspector Kirk Donnelly from Glenrothes Police Station said: “It is disappointing to hear of this mindless act of vandalism that has caused considerable damage to the Balbirnie Golf Course.“There is a minority in our community who feel this sort of behaviour is acceptable, but I want to be clear, that it is not.“I am aware of a number of reports from members of the public recently of young people gathering in this area, who are abusing alcohol, littering and becoming involved in antisocial behaviour.“Officers are working with Fe Council and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service to ensure the area is patrolled regularly, but I would also urge the parents and s of young people to encourage them against gathering in groups and remind them that anti-social behaviour of any kind will not be tolerated.“We are following lines of enquiry into this incident of vandalism and I am appealing to anyone who may have been in the area at the time and saw anything to contact the police.”Newsletter

After moving away from the area separately as young adults, they got together when they both came back.Almost exactly  years ago, they had their first child, Elisabeth, whose birthday was last month. Olivia, , was also born in Cornwall. Then Ben’s job as an aircraft engineer took them to RAF Valley in Wales, where twins Charlotte and Isabelle, now , came along.Another move took the Sullivans to RAF Benson, in Oxfordshire, and their first boy Noah, now , came along, followed by Evangeline, nine, and eight-year-old Tobias.A sht to Lossiemouth followed, where the family was completed . Twins Leah and Erin, now five, were very premature. Agnes, three, and Joseph, two, are the babies of the family.Zoe isn’t quite sure how they ended up with such a huge family. Ben was one of five siblings, but the couple never made a conscious decision to go big.She said: “We never really said let’s have lots of children. We had Noah and then it was like let’s just keep going – this is quite fun.“The twins were supposed to be the last ones, but we carried on. Joseph is only two, so we still have a whole letime to go.”And is there room for any more in the Sullivan family Zoe would only commit to: “No more have arrived # yet.”From shopping trips to days out, the Sullivans have to plan everything they do.For a while, they had two seven-seater Vauxhall Zafiras to ferry the family around – although at the moment they are down to a single Astra for essential journeys.Zoe revealed the key to a happy le is to get the chores as much done in the morning as possible.She said: “We’re very organised people and the kids are too – that’s the only way that works for us.“I’m up at .am on weekdays, and get a slightly later start at the weekend of am.“We’re a good team. Everybody knows what they’ve got to do and knows when to pitch in.”The Sullivan family fit themselves into a standard four-bedroomed house, with Zoe and Ben in one room, the three boys in another, and the girls split by age in the last two.Zoe admitted: “My dream house would have  or  bedrooms, but that seems a tall order.”Food is on an industrial scale # everything comes in multiples of kilogrammes, and Zoe shops four times a week just to keep everything topped up.In terms of treats and outings, the family keep it to day trips – and it all comes under the budgeting umbrella, with Ben’s salary and child benefit the mainstay of income.Zoe said: “It’s a lot of budgeting. We don’t really have holidays, we just have day trips and do things that are free. We’ll go to a park for the day and have Burger King as a treat. We also spend a lot of time at the beach.“One thing I wish we could have is a holiday – but we don’t go many places that cost money because it’s so expensive.A few years ago, with fewer children, they splashed out on a Landmark season ticket – “but that came to about £, I think”.In terms of the future, Zoe is torn between seeing her children fulfil their potential and dreading the moment when she has an empty house.Olivia is planning art at university – which would make her the first to fly the nest.Zoe said: “I really want her to go, but I’m sad at the same time.”Ben will leave the RAF in the next few years and the family will be looking to buy their own house after living in tied accommodation. They are planning to stay in the Lossie area – as Zoe says: “Although Cornwall was our home, this is the kids’ home.“We’re looking forward to watching the kids grow up – but not too soon, I don’t want to be lonely.”In the meantime, the Sullivan family are finding fame of sorts as one of Britain’s biggest.They will feature in the ITV show on Thursday at pm, and they have their own YouTube channel and Facebook page.Zoe also blogs about everything from mental health to everyday le.She said: “I don’t think I’m necessarily doing it right or better than anyone , but people were interested and asking about it, so I started a blog.“This is just how we do it.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/Mark-Robinson-525x372.jpg ","title":"north east man to motorcycle north coast 500 in one day for charity","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remA former police officer is aiming to motorcycle Scotland’s equivalent of Route  in one day to raise funds for charity.Mark David Robinson is travelling theof the North Coast  on Saturday June  in aid of North East Rider Volunteers Scotland , a charity he volunteers at.The -year-old will complete the challenge within a -hour period and aims to raise in excess of £.He has completed a number of sports-related challenges in the past with all donations going towards organisations close to his heart.NERVS provides free transportation for the Grampian Health Service.Mark, who is originally from Watford but currently lives in Dinnet, said: #Over the years, I#ve done Lands End to John O#Groats by motorcycle in one day, as well as Lands End to John O#Groats and back to Lands End in just two days.#In , while serving in Grampian Police, I rode a marked police bike to all  of the police force HQ#s at the time on the mainland in  days and , miles for Commando .#The following year, I went to the four furthest most compass points and police memorials for Care of Police Survivors on my motorcycle. And later that year I did a six-hour gym endurance event, lting . tons to raise funds for Commando  again.#After Storm Frank , I arranged a huge fundraiser for the victims in Ballater and raised just over £k in one evening. You can see I#m keen to do my bit.#Mark, who is now a quarry dumper driver, was inspired by Captain Tom to tackle more charity challenges while being furloughed.This included walking one million steps in  days and donating all earnings to the NHS.He added: #I#d seen Captain Tom starting his historic walk and thought as I was half his age I could do something too.#I like a walk now and again and worked out I had  days before ing to work. I had a quick chat with my we and popped outside to walk one million steps in  days.#I#ll be honest, blisters aren#t much fun, neither is walking over  miles a day. But as it was me against the  miles ahead, it was crack on and walk.#The first , steps were local # on South Deeside Road, and so on # or I#d have my we drop me off at the far side of Aboyne and I#d walk to Ballater. I did that a few times but the hard surfaces killed my feet.#I did the remaining , steps on a  step circuit around Monaltrie Park in Ballater. I wore a track in the grass too. It was hard butit was easy everyone would do it.#My family thinks I#m barking mad but I#ve never failed in any event, so they support me and know when things are hurting me to give me some time and space to chill out.#Friends were kind enough to chip in with sponsorship too. If memory serves, I raised around £,.#After the walk, I had two weeks off at Christmas and cycled on a gym bike at home the  miles from Lands End to John O#Groats for Care of Police Survivors.#I fancied doing something  on my motorcycle and thought of raising money for NERVS. I#m hoping to raise in excess of £.#I#m a volunteer motorcyclist for the charity. I volunteer one day per month as my day job and family take up my free time.#I would be contacted by the controller and attend our office in Dyce, collect one of the marked bikes or cars and convey surgeons instruments, prescriptions, etc. in the north east.#Mark will be joined by his friend Brett Bonas throughout the journey.The pair will be starting at Inverness Castle and plan towithin - hours having covered  miles.Mark#s current employer, LeithsLtd, is covering the cost of his fuel and hotel.Visit https:uk.virginmoneygiving MarkRobinson to make a donation.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/04/injecting-scotland-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland here are the key demographics","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWe’ve put together some regularly updating charts and maps showing the demographic information available on the people affected by the coronavirus pandemic in Scotland.The charts below show the distribution of deaths by age and gender.Given the way the virus transmits, we also looked at whether there was any link between the fatality rate and the population density.The NRS provides information on the number of deaths by smaller areas, known as intermediate zones, once per month.The chart below shows the proportion of deaths by location.This chart shows Covid- as a proportion of deaths each week in Scotland.The animated chart below shows where Covid- sits in the ranks of leading causes of death in Scotland.Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts\" title\"#Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts# #

preparations for a potential senior international debut are dferent to most.The -year-old could make her bow for Scotland against Ireland in four T matches in Belfast later this month.However, her build-up to those games is being dominated by exams.As a fth-year pupil at Gordon Schools in Huntly, Lister is currently sitting her Highers, while also dreaming of representing her country at senior level, having previously played for the A side and age group teams.She said: “It’s quite tough to fit everything in, especially this year, I’m in the middle of my exams.“I’ve got eight exams and the last exam is the day before we go to Ireland.“So this year it has been very full on, but the school has been really good.“They give me authorised absence when I need to go away and then I catch up when I come back or do extra work before I go.It#s quite tough to fit everything in.#“But this year doing my Highers it’s been more dficult because they’re the big exams.“Hopefully by the end of the next two weeks I’ll be free for cricket all the time.“The next two weeks will be very full on, but I’ll be even more excited to go to Ireland because I’ll be done with exams.“It’s dficult and I’m having to balance quite a lot between study and cricket.“But I’m trying to make sure I get enough of both and I met the new Scotland coach Mark Coles for the first time last Wednesday.“He must have heard from the coaches and the captain about me and that was why I got picked, because he’d never actually met me or seen me play.“It was good to meet him and I’ve been able to balance my cricket and my studies quite well.“At the weekend I was playing cricket on Saturday and then on Sunday I was studying all day.”Scotland’s fixtures later this month will be their first since September .They had been been scheduled to play Ireland in Spain last November and then in March.Lister was in both those squads, but the fixtures were called off because of the pandemic.She hopes she can make her senior international debut this month in the fixtures to be played on May , ,  and .The Stoneywood-Dyce wicketkeeper added: “It would be unbelievable, I still can’t get my head around the fact I play for Scotland and possibly have this opportunity to make my debut coming up when we’re away.“I’ve had a couple of opportunities which ended up being called off.“We were supposed to go to Spain in November and then again in March, but they got cancelled because of Covid.“I’ve been waiting for my opportunity and hopefully I will get that opportunity in Ireland to make my debut.“It means a huge amount to me and to my family.”If she does make her Scotland debut this month Lister hopes it can lead to more international action both this summer and further down the line.“To be honest I think I’m at the start,” the teenager said.“Hopefully I have many more games to come and I just want to progress my cricket as far as I can.“We’ve got World Cup qualiers at the end of the summer and that will be our main focus.“We’ve also got Commonwealth Games qualiers next year as well, so there are opportunities there.”Huntly has long been a hotbed for cricket, with Scotland and England international Kirstie

Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.The reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints. Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers. Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.The national charity for older people is encouraging people to get moving every day next month as part of a new fundraising activity challenge.Throughout May, Age Scotland is asking people across the country to Spring into Action to help support older people in Scotland.Fundraisers can take part however they choose, but the most important thing is to make sure they are active every day.All funds raised by Spring into Action participants will go towards Age Scotland#s vital services, including the national friendship line, which offers a place older people can turn tothey are in need of support, comfort and reassurance or even just missing a friendly voice.Running and walking events have always been a great way to help raise vital funds and, even with many regular events unfortunately cancelled over the past year, we#ve been overwhelmed by the kindness and generosity shown by fundraisers still going above and beyond.We hope to see as many people as possible taking up our challenge to Spring into Action this May.

Online records showed his birthplace as #Inchial Argileshire#, which turned out to be the parish of Glenorchy and Inishail at the head of Loch Awe.Alexander McNab was born there to Alexander senior and Margaret McNab in  — one of a family of three brothers and four sisters — and moved south to Burnley in Lancashire in the s. In Lancashire in , he married Janet Wardrope, who came from Milngavie outside Glasgow, and they went on to have  children.Going back a few generations, Clare#s research has traced Alexander#s great grandfather, John McNab, born in Kilbrandon in the area around Loch Melfort in .His son Peter, born around , went on to farm in Connel and is recorded in the  census as an -year-old, farming  acres at South Ledaig, though is described as a #smith# in an earlier record.Born in , Peter#s son Alexander grew up to work in farming around Glenorchy. In the  census he is recorded as a ploughman at Barbreck.#Our# Alexander seems to have been a blacksmith when he moved from Argyll to Burnley to start a new le.Sadly, two of Alexander and Janet#s family died as young children.Later, however, they found themselves — like so many other families — caught up in the horrors of the First World War.They lost three sons — Andrew, aged , missing in action,  Alex, , missing in action,  and John, , missing in action,  — during the war.The grief the family must have borne is unimaginable. The boys# names are recorded on three separate First World War memorials in Belgium and France.Clare said: #What a tragedy losing your sons. Andrew, Alex and John were brothers of my great grandma, Grace McNab Bridge.#Alexander died in  at the age of , after being hit by a tramcar in Blackpool during the blackout. He was living with daughter Grace and her family at the time. A short newspaper report from the time describes him as a #retired blacksmith#.Clare was born in Blackpool and moved to Tees-side, via a spell in Dumfries, through her husband David#s employment.Though her great grandmother Grace passed away in , Clare believes she can detect echoes of the past in her own family today.She explained: #My son, who is in army, has just trained in music and learnt the bagpipes.#Little bits keep popping up. My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area.

A big decision has been swept under the carpet.#The budget was reduced by £,, from £, to £,.Douglas Hendry, executive director of customer services, said: #Our process is not to fund routes where there is alternative transport available or where there are less than , people travelling annually.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPiper#s march wins prizeThe Campbeltown piper who won a competition to compose a tune to mark a battle in which many of his comrades fought was presented with his prize on Tuesday # the battle#s rd anniversary.Mr George McIntyre from Meadowburn won a competition run by the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to compose a   march in memory of the Battle of Longstop Hill in .On Tuesday, Longstop Day, Major Hamish Clarkof the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders travelled to Campbeltown to present George with a specially engraved quaich at a ceremony at the Argyll Hotel.Many Kintyre men fought at the battle which was one of the decisive moments in the Second World War against the Germans in North Africa.Major Duncan McMillan, who won the Military Medal at the battle, attended the ceremony along with many of George#s other old army friends.Before he handed the quaich to George, Major Clark said: #I really can#t think of anyone more appropriate to have won the competition than George McIntyre himself.#If George had not been taken prisoner in  he may well have fought at Longstop.#Receiving the quaich, George said: #It gives me great honour to achieve this.#Then Mr Ian McKerral from Kintyre and District Pipe Band gave the first public performance of the tune.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe end of the road for PaulPaul McCartney, who is at the moment staying at High Park Farm, Campbeltown, has just made one giant step forward towards severing all his connections with the other three Beatles.John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr abandoned their appeal against a High Court order on Monday, putting the affairs of their company, Apple, in the hands of a receiver. The three now face a legal costs bill estimated at £,.Mr Morris Finer, QC for John, George, Ringo and Apple, told the appeal court on Monday that they now considered it was in the common interest to explore ways of allowing Paul to free himself from the partnership by agreement.Mr David Hurst QC on behalf of Paul said: #He will most willingly enter into the proposed negotiations to achieve his freedom from the partnership by consent rather than by court action.#Well, it looks very much like the end of the #long and winding road# to quote a well known McCartney ballad.What does Paul himself feel about the rise and fall of the Beatles Two Courier men drove up to High Park Farm — which has a long and decidedly bumpy road leading to it — to find out what the man in the centre of it all felt about things.Apart from being obviously excited about his latest and most important success, Paul did not like saying anything about the matter.Though very polite and friendly, he made it quite clear that he does not see any point in giving interviews or saying anything remotely sensational.After ten years of being harried and hustled by journalists and photographers never having a minute#s peace to himself always having been the centre of attraction never having been able to pop in to the #local#, is it any wonder that Paul is determined to live as quietly as possible He seemed as happy as a sand-boy, out there in the wilds.When we approached him, he had obviously been brushing down one of his horses because he still held a horse brush in his hand.His we Linda looked the essence of happiness as her golden hair mirrored the warm sunshine. The children yelled and gurgled contentedly and even Martha, the English sheepdog, seemed happy.The farm house itself has been extensively renovated, a new roof having been constructed and the farm work appears to be progressing normally.Paul himself has changed. Outwardly at any rate. Gone is the Beatle mop, the style which was copied the whole word over. Gone is the boyish grin, which once sent screaming thousands into ecstasy.What has taken the place of these characteristics  Paul now sports a beard the hair remains longish but it is brushed back, revealing the full extent of his forehead the smile is no longer boyish.The former bass-guitarist song-writer with the most influential and certainly most famous foursome the world has ever known has changed.Paul will probably continue to compose such brilliant songs as Maybe I#m Amazed and Another Day but to millions of people, from Campbeltown to Honolulu, pop music will certainly never be the same again.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and flashesThere would be some fluttering this week among the ladies in the town who are liable to serve on a jury, summonses to appear on the occasion of a forthcoming jury trial having been issued to  ladies and  gentlemen.

If you are taking a long-term view then a garden full of reliable flowering shrubs is also an option.Whatever garden you have, watering and weeding are the key watchwords for May. It is essential to water newly planted fruit trees, roses and shrubs regularly to help their root systems get established.It is also the time of year when many plants# demand for water increases as they start their major growth period. Top watering tips include – every time you plant something, water it in well, make a moat of soil round newly planted plants so that water doesn#t run off and goes to the roots, water pots and containers so that water appears right to the top of the pot and get a water butt.If you have a drainpipe, you have a natural water supply so a simple garden solution for May is to ensure that you have adequate water storage. If you buy and fit a water butt, it will provide you with water for the garden in an environmentally friendly way and on a regular basis.Annual weeds will be popping up now, so weeding borders once a week to prevent weed seedlings establishing is a good idea. The problem with the most common weeds such as nettles, dandelions and bindweed, is that they are very, very tough. They can continue to grow in conditions that make most garden plants simply fade away – and they do that, in part, by using the moisture, nutrients and light of the plants around them.A great plant to get you into the summer gardening spirit is the pretty petunia – perfect for containers and hanging baskets and a great choice for instant colour. It can flower all summer long, providing you deadhead regularly, and comes in a iety of colours to suit any garden palette.Petunias are also available in dferent blooms including single, double, ruffled or smooth petals. They can be striped, veined or solid in colour and most sold today are hybrids developed for specic design purposes such as fragrance.They need full sun and can#t tolerate frost but can grow in a wide range of soils and thrive in multipurpose compost when planted in containers.Keeping on top of garden maintenance is crucial in May. The garden is coming alive so there is plenty to keep you busy. Here are some jobs you should be thinking about this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"liveargylls leisure facilities and libraries reopen","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Their father Stephen, aged , is in his th year of service with the crew.His father Robert is now aged  and, before retiring, he served  years and his father, the late Robert Scally senior, served for  years.The sea is in the Scally family blood Stephen senior, who is also the Campbeltown harbour master, was a fisherman, as was his father.#My grandfather was a fisherman and he met my grandmother at Mallaig, where she was one of the herring lasses who followed the fishing fleet as it followed the herring around the coast,# said Stephen senior. #Her family came from Peterhead and all her brothers were fishermen.#None of the latest generation of Scallys to serve is a fisherman.Between them, the Scally family have served on Campbeltown leboats City of Glasgow, City of Glasgow II, Walter and Margaret Cooper and Ernest and Mary Shaw.Stephen Scally senior and Robert Scally are both recipients of the institute#s bronze medal for bravery and both are qualied coxswains.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOGerman giant to call in the Wee ToonGermany#s flagship passenger cruise ship is to visit Campbeltown next summer with up to  passengers on board, it was revealed this week.The Hamburg-based MS Europa will be docking in the town for six hours on Wednesday July  next year, during a voyage around the British Isles.The cruiser, owned by German shipping firm Hapag-Lloyd, is  metres high and nearly  metres long.It carries between  and  passengers.It will dock in the loch around midday and leave for Oban at pm. Campbeltown Harbour Office said that the Europa was #arguably the biggest boat to come into Campbeltown for a long time#.The chairperson of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancie Smith, hoped a special gala day could be organised to mark the ship#s visit.She said: #This is an opportunity we should grasp with both hands. I anticipate there will be some form of civic entertainment laid on.#Mrs Smith added that she hoped many shops in the centre of town would not close for the half day to make the visitors feel welcome.She told the Courier: #It is important that the visitors see the town looking at its best and we hope this will be supported by all the businesses and shops which will stay open for business that day.#The local director of Argyll, the Isles, Loch Lomond, Stirling and the Trossachs Tourist Board, Mr Bruce Urquhart, hailed the Europa#s planned visit as a great opportunity for Campbeltown.FIFTY YEARS AGOFarmer#s heroic effort to save barnFire dealt a cruel blow to a local farmer yesterday afternoon, for the second time in three years.As fire fighting units raced from Campbeltown, a barn at Low Tirfergus Farm near Drumlemble was ablaze from end to end. Flames were fanned by a fresh easterly breeze.And despite a heroic effort by the farmer, Mr Roderick Morrison, son-in-law of the farm#s owner Mr A Barker, the fire had a firm hold by the time the fire brigade arrived.The alarm was raised by Mr Morrison#s we who alerted him.Armed with a pitchfork, Mr Morrison tried to separate the blazing straw, which was being used as feeding, from the rest of the barn#s contents, but it was in vain.Firemen had to jump clear as the roof caved in with a tremendous crash.The straw inside the barn was totally destroyed.The £ barn was erected three years ago after  tons of hay and  tons of straw were destroyed in a blaze at the same farm.It stood on its own, some distance from the other farm buildings.Labour back in control – by one seatLabour retained control of Campbeltown Town Council at Tuesday#s municipal elections, though they lost one seat to the Progressives.The composition of the council now reads: Labour nine seats, Progressive eight seats.Provost Daniel McKinven and Councillor Edward Scragg, who formerly sat under the Independent Socialist and SBP banners respectively, fought the contest as Progressives. Both were re-elected.And -year old William Crossan, of Kinloch Road, Campbeltown, became the youngest member ever to sit in the council chambers.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCoal strikeAttention should be paid to the announcement in our advt. columns regarding the pressure of gas from the local works, special arrangements commencing on Saturday night with the object of conserving the stock of coal.A coal laden schooner, carrying about  tons of household coal, which arrived here just at the beginning of the coal strike and was prohibited from discharging by the customs authorities, had the embargo removed this week, the cargo being transferred to one of the local coal merchants.One hundred tons dished out in half-cwt lots, which is the household allowance for a week, will help a bit to keep the home fires burning.The coal fight drags on without the smallest sign of either side giving way. Apparently the nation will have to suffer much more before a settlement is reached, and unfortunately there is no very clear guarantee that even a settlement of the coal dispute would restore us to anything like prosperity.Every minute of the clock-round stocks are being reduced, andthe dispute lasts much longer, the miners will produce a general lock-out of their fellow-workers, which will have all the dire effects of a general strike without any of its heroics. It is a deplorable situation."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

entered Strathfillan. Itrsquos named after Saint Fillan and the healing pool associated with him was their next destination. Izzy pulled Bess into a minor road and found a parking place.ldquoItrsquos not far, she said, pointing to a sign that said Holy Pool.Finn raised his eyebrows, giving her a sceptical look her concept of not far was dferent to his!ldquoNo, really, this time it isnrsquot, she assured him. ldquoThe pool is just over there, a very short walk through the trees.The morning was lting and Izzy wandered to a nearby small hillock to take in the view. The mountain tops were still mostly hidden under blankets of mist, but small breaks in the cloud were giving tantalising glimpses of Ben More and Ben Lui.Finn joined his aunt.She spoke to her nephew while looking out to the landscape: ldquoA strath is a river valley, Finn, and the river here flows to Loch Dochart. This is Strathfillan, itrsquos named after the saint of that name who came and settled here to preach his religion, before Scotland even existed.ldquoYou mean the saint whose magic healing stones we saw at the mill in Killin Izzy nodded with a very pleased smile, happy hersquod remembered.ldquoYes, thatrsquos him. This part of the river is called Fillanrsquos Water, itrsquos where the healing pool is.Finn was impatient: ldquoLetrsquos go there now, I want to swim in it!They walked through a small wood of twisted birch trees, their leaves lightly touched by the yellow of autumn. The moment Finn entered the wood, he could sense the place had a mysterious air to it. The path zigzagged down to the river and within a couple of minutes they reached the edge of the pool.It wasnrsquot quite what he had expected: a bulge in the river, where the flow of the peaty water slowed, making a deep and calm natural basin. Finn stared at the deep brown water, it was too dark to see anything underneath the surface. It had an almost eerie feeling to it, yet at the same time was quietly inviting.ldquoThis is a place of myth making and history, Izzy said as she sat by the riverbank to set up her stove. Soon its hissing filled the air. She sipped her coffee, waiting for Finn to join her. He took an apple from her rucksack and sat next to her. He wanted to know about this place.ldquoIt was probably a sacred place even before St Fillan and Christianity came here, she said. She explained how the early Celts venerated water and places such as this were associated with their gods and of the spirituality within nature itself.Then she told him stories about St Fillan of how his ox was killed by a wolf, but that afterwards the wolf ed. The saint forgave the creature and to make amends it agreed to be yoked and pull the plough that had been the job of the ox.Finn spoke up: ldquoBut the wolf didnrsquot do anything wrong, surely  It was a wolf after all and the ox was prey, itrsquos what wolves do.ldquoThatrsquos true, Finn, but it is a tale made to show how miraculous his god was. There were many of them. Another was that St Fillan had a bell that could magically fly and also his left arm could shine in the dark, giving him light to read and write at night.ldquoHe sounds more like a superhero, remarked Finn.Izzy chuckled: ldquoYeah, I suppose that was the idea, it was a way of showing people the power of god and of course people at the time really believed these stories. St Fillanrsquos arm bone became a relic called the Mayne, and there is a story that it was taken to Bannockburn on the orders of Robert the Bruce to help him win the battle.Finn knew about Robert the Bruce and wanted to hear the tale of the Mayne. Izzy told it with humour, how the arm bone appeared miraculously, to the surprise of the abbot, who had been afraid to bring it in case it got lost.Finn looked at the pool: ldquoSo according to these stories, he used his powers to make the water here magical ldquoYep, said Izzy, drinking the last of her coffee. ldquoItrsquos mostly forgotten now, but for hundreds of years this was a place of pilgrimage where people came to be cured. The water was said to cure people of mental health problems. She explained the bizarre ritual of how people were submerged in the pool and given the task of finding stones from the river bed, then spent a night tied up in the nearby priory.Finn laughed out loud at the image of it all.Well, I donrsquot believe the stories, said Finn, ldquobut Irsquod still like to swim in the pool and seeI can find some stones.Izzy knew she would have to go in with him. She had brought their swimming gear and towels just in case, and soon they were howling and shrieking as they lowered themselves into the cold water. Within a minute, their bodies numbed to it and they began to swim.Trees lined both banks and they got a good view of the modern bridge further up the river. Finn watched as cars, tour buses and campervans sped over it, passing without a glance.He stayed in the water longer than his aunt, swimming in circles, then exploring the far side of the river. He managed to get three pebbles from the shallower section of the pool on its eastern edge. As he emerged shivering, the sun suddenly broke through the clouds, giving welcome and timely warmth as he dried himself.ldquoI get it now, said Finn, laughing. ldquoYou actually have to be mad to go in there in the first place!He studied the stones in his hand, then looked up: ldquoI know a story about Robert the Bruce.He told his story wrapped in a large towel, his hair still wet and dripping. It was the story of Bruce and the spider, and he told it beautully, under the shade of the birch trees next to the ancient healing pool. The only interruption was birdsong. Now Izzy was the listener and Finn the storyteller. It was an incredibly special moment.ldquoItrsquos a story about not giving up, explained Finn after hersquod finished telling it. ldquoMaybe it didnrsquot happen exactly that way, but itrsquos still got truth in it. He gave his aunt a big smile.His words spoke directly to her, in a way he wouldnrsquot understand. She glanced towards the trees for a moment, then ed Finnrsquos big smile.ldquoFantastic telling, Finn. And you know what  One of the battles he was defeated in took place just over there, at a place called Dalrigh, the field of the king. She pointed to beyond the bridge. ldquoHe was being hunted by his enemies and nearly got killed in the battle. At least he escaped with his le to later meet the spider! According to legend, he threw his sword into a small loch as he fled. His followers did the same and itrsquos been called Lochan nam Arm ever since, which means loch of the weapons. Some say Brucersquos sword still lies in the mud there, which is why people also call it the Loch of the Sword.Finn was excited by this connection. He wanted to see the loch, maybe he could even find the sword! Hersquod once been to Bannockburn visitor centre, it had been a fun day out. But here, history felt so much closer, more real, although he couldnrsquot put into words why.Izzy agreed they could have lunch at Lochan nam Arm. As she packed up, Finn stood by the waterrsquos edge and dropped one of the pebbles back into the pool. He watched as the circular ripples expanded on the calm surface, finally vanishing. He did the same with the second pebble, again watching the ripples the splash had made.Then he spoke, while still studying the water.ldquoMy dad once told me that le is a stone thrown into the water: it leaves ripples long after it has vanished.Izzy froze, saying nothing in case she chose the wrong words.Finn looked at the third stone still in his hand. Instead of throwing it into the water, he hurled it into the wood. It bounced off the trunk of a birch tree, then fell into the undergrowth.ldquoBut he was wrong because some stones just vanish, like that one, thatrsquos all they do, because they are not worth anything. Finnrsquos mood had suddenly changed.ldquoI hated that stone, he said with anger in his voice.Izzy stood up. ldquoFinn, she said softly, holding out her arms, offering a hug.He just turned and walked up the path towards the car, picking up a stick and hitting the trees with it.ldquoI hate him, I hate him, he screamed.Izzyrsquos stomach sank. Her mind raced over what had happened, what had been the trigger, was it something she had said Then she realised.She walked up the path and found Finn by the car, looking out to the mountains which now framed the near horizon all around them.ldquoYou OK, sweetie  You want to talk Finn shook his head.ldquoI want to phone my mum, he eventually replied.ldquoOf course, therersquos a phone at Tyndrum, just down the road. Letrsquos seewe can get hold of her, it will be nearly lunchtime where she is, so maybe she will be free.Finn noticed the sign for Dalrigh, then minutes later they arrived at Tyndrum.Luckily, Finnrsquos mum was able to come to the phone.As Finn spoke with his mum, Izzy saw Ewen pull up at the petrol station. He was in a dferent car and wearing a jacket with a hood half pulled over his face, but she knew it was him. He was being very careful, as shersquod asked him to be. She didnrsquot know how much hersquod seen and heard by the pool.How to tell him shersquod decided it may be best to abandon the whole trip, take Finn back home and wait there for his mum and stepdad to . It just felt too risky and she was worried about Finn. She knew Ewen would be devastated.Finn hung up and seemed happier after the call.ldquoI was thinking we might head back to your home today, Finn. You know, with lights and TV and normal stuff, said Izzy with a smile and a wink.Finnrsquos reaction wasnrsquot what she expected.ldquoWhy, aunty  Irsquom sorry I got angry, but Irsquom OK now. You promised me an adventure to Loch Ness, why are you giving up and breaking your promise So they walked to Lochan nam Arm. Izzy told the story of Brucersquos escape from the MacDougalls and they both made lunch together by a patch of late flowering foxgloves. Some walkers on the West Highland Way passed them, but mostly they had the loch side to themselves.Finn didnrsquot find the sword of Robert the Bruce, of course.

Not all animals are the same some cats and dogs enjoy noise and excitement, but to others this would be very stressful.Others like peace and quiet ndash but to some, being left quiet and alone is stressful.I think most of us are aware that sudden, unusual noises can frighten pets for example, thunderstorms and fireworks. These are sounds which are strange to your pet and can result in a great deal of stress.In a recent survey carried out by the PDSA,  per cent of owners said their pet was scared of fireworks. The main signs the owners reported were cowering and hiding, trembling and shaking, disinterest in food and barking.Pets left alone either at home or in a cattery or kennel, which are unusual occurrences, can result in severe stress, as the pet feels abandoned by their family.Bringing in a new pet or moving home can also feel terrying for a pet which is used to constancy. Sometimes the dynamics of the pets within a home can change and one or more pet can feel threatened.At Dunedin Vets, at the beginning of lockdown, we saw many problems, especially with cats who were not used to their owners being at home all the time.Cats are notoriously sensitive to change. They may hide their stress but it can manest in other ways.This can include bladder problems and over-grooming and itching.Please contact your vet for adviceyou feel your pet requires some help to overcome their stress-related problems.It is wonderful to be out and about in the spring sunshine, albeit it is a bit chilly at the moment.Remember, there are a few hazards to avoid when walking your dog.Do not throw sticks for them to catch or retrieve. These can cause terrible injuriesthe dog runs onto them and injuries occur in their mouth or, as I have seen, penetrate their skin and damage structures in their necks.Last month, we mentioned the collie dog who was chasing his ball and accidentally swallowed it.Recently, our senior veterinary nurse Nicole saw a young couple rush to the front door of our Tranent surgery, carrying their dog. The owners were obviously very distressed, so Nicole spoke with them and discovered that they were sure Loki, their three-year-old cockapoo, had tried to swallow the bouncy ball toy he had been playing with.Mrs Pamela Masson explained it was a hard rubber ball with rubber spikes on it.Nicole could hear Loki making strange noises when breathing she checked he was able to breathe and called the vet to examine Loki. Gently opening his mouth, they could just glimpse something blue at the back of his mouth.Nicole had previously been involved in dealing with a dog which had choked on a ball. She knew this dog was somehow managing to breathe, unlike the previous one she had dealt with, which was unable to breathe and had been rapidly turning blue.She reassured the owners and admitted Loki for treatment to extract the ball. As choking animals are very distressed, they are likely to panic and bite, although Loki was remaining remarkably calm. The team prepared short-acting intravenous anaesthetic and several pairs of dferent-sized forceps to help extract the ball. Once a catheter was placed in Lokirsquos leg vein, everything had to be performed rapidly as soon as the anaesthetic injection was administered, to prevent the ball falling further into Lokirsquos larynx or dropping into the oesophagus. With Nicole supporting his head and a light being shone into the mouth, the blue spiky ball was seen. Grasping it with forceps, and with some tension and rotation, the vet extracted the offending ball from Lokirsquos throat.The ball had a central hole, or tunnel, running through it. This was the reason Loki was able to breathe, albeit in a laboured, noisy fashion.The ball had lodged with its central tunnel in line with Lokirsquos mouth and larynx. The rubber spikes caused a bit of damage to the soft areas around his larynx, but these would soon heal. Loki recovered quickly from his short-acting anaesthetic and was soon heading home with his parents.It is great to play ball with your dog but make sure youdo play with a ball large enough that your dog cannot swallow or choke.If you are playing with a solid rubber ball, please ensure it does have a central hole right through it.This was undoubtedly the reason why Loki was able to breathe.It also makes it much easier for the vet to remove, as there is something to grab onto. A smooth rubber ball completely stuck in the throat is surprisingly dficult to grasp and remove.I think Loki will be playing with footballs from now on."},{"url":null,"title":"musician-records-sounds-north-berwick-new-album-series-depicting-seven-continents","story":"Ted White, who was brought up on Cromwell Road, where parents Sally and Andrew still live, was approached by music distribution service Platoon to co-ordinate field recordings he had gathered around the world over several years and release them via Apple last month.Each of the seven albums is dedicated to a dferent continent, and the sounds of North Berwickrsquos beaches and harbour feature on the Europe: Earth Sounds album.Ted, , said: ldquoI travel a lot, recording sounds around the world, and Platoon and I collectively came up with the concept of collating my recordings of the past seven years into continents of the world.ldquoI did a bit more travelling to record the bits I didnrsquot have.A former student at Loretto now splitting his time between Liverpool and London, Ted came back to North Berwick to capture the seaside townrsquos night-time atmosphere.He said: ldquoI grew up there so I knew where I could get good sounds without the noise pollution that you get in London.ldquoI recorded lots of midnight sounds on the beaches.

Bees and other pollinating insects will be on the hunt at other times of year too,\" says Perry. \"Spring nectar sources can help pollinators to refuel after their hibernation period, and in autumn it can help them build energy reserves for the winter months. Be sure to plant with the widest range of blooming periods in mind, so the wildle never goes hungry.\"The calendar is designed to help gardeners of all abilities turn their outdoor spaces into a pollinator paradise all year round, buzzing with a riot of colour, texture and scent and a perfect way to contribute to World Bee Day .These are some of the plants which Perry recommends to help bees through all four seasons...SPRINGLungwort - the lovely lungwort flower grows low to the ground, and blooms early to bring food to the first pollinators of spring. They grow best in containers, so theyre great for planting in a small space.Peony - these pink beauties are rich in pollen, and pollinating insects love their single blooms. Plant your peonies in rich, dry soil in the sun.Magnolia - our buzzing buddies are drawn to the magnicent magnolias saucer-sized blooms, and love to snack on their sweet nectar. Magnolias love sun and acid soil with lots of moisture.Pussy willow - pussy willow pollen is high in protein, and the spring bloom provides an early source of nutrition for our busy friends.SUMMERLavender - At home in a Mediterranean style garden and also in pots or as a low hedge for potagers, lavender produces both pollen and nectar, making it a great food source for honey bees. They even create lavender-flavoured honey from the plant. Lavender does well in full sun in sandy or chalky, well-drained soil - nothing thats too rich.Foxglove - honey bees and bumblebees work together to pollinate this classic cottage garden favourite. The bumblebee creates holes in the side of the flower to make it easier for the honey bee to swoop in and access the flowers pollen.Hawthorn - our hive heroes can make dark and rich honey from hawthorn nectar. This flower grows best in sunny conditions and is tolerant of all soil types.Marjoram - marjoram is a favourite of humans and our pollinating pals alike - these nectar-rich flowers are actually a perennial herb and close relative of oregano.AUTUMNAster - these pretty perennials with daisy-like flowers ying from purple, violet, and lavender to pink with orange-yellow centres, need lots of water. Its worth adding a mulch to retain the moisture, but theyre worth it to keep the bees happy and help honey bees build up reserves of pollen for winter to get them through the cold months. Plant asters in full sun for them to shine.Honeysuckle - This fast-growing climber, which can be deciduous or evergreen, bearing blooms ranging from creamy-white through yellow to red, is famed for its powerful scent and is a magnet for bees. It starts to flower in the summer but can continue to autumn, given the right conditions. It prefers a sunny spot and isnt fussy about the soil.Single-bloom dahlias - If youre wanting to attract bees, go for the single bloom types of dahlia such as the Happy Single Series over the other ieties such as pompoms or balls, which are less accessible to insects.Sedum - Their pretty flowerheads are full of nectar which makes these low-growing perennials perfect for the front of a border or in prairie plantings, flowering right through to October. Sedum flowers are perfect for honey bees as a late source of pollen and nectar, helping to build up honey stores for the colder winter.WINTERWinter aconite - these low-growing small tuberous perennials from the buttercup family produce bright yellow cup-shaped flowers which are good for ground cover and provide a burst of winter and spring colour under shrubs and roses.Mahonia - Clusters of highly scented bright yellow flowers appear in winter on these tough, spiky evergreen shrubs which are easy to grow, produce lots of nectar and also provide purple to black berries in the autumn, a feast for the birds.Helleborus - hellebores provide sugar-rich nectar and high-protein pollen to help keep the bees energetic and strong through the middle of winter. They thrive in alkaline soil and their subtle shades ranging from cream to deep purple will bring le to a darker area, as they are tolerant of shade.Snowdrop - these pint-sized beauties are among the first bulbs to emerge in winter, providing rich nectar when other food is hard to find. Plant dferent ieties which flower at dferent times in winter to give the bees a longer foraging season.Crocus - these hardy flowers can break through ice and snow to bring food to winter honey bees. Plant them in the sun so that the flowers will fully open and make it easier for the bees to forage on the nectar. Crocuses naturalise well so can create carpets of colourful flowers in winter.For more information on the Hives For Lives programme visit rowsehoney."},{"url":null,"title":"south-indian-prawn-curry-parathas-ideal-weeknight-treat","story":"Ingredients: Parathas g wholemeal flour  tsp saltml water Ghee or sunflower oilPrawn Curry x onions, slicedg fresh root ginger, gratedx fresh chilli halved, deseeded and sliced  x garlic cloves, crushed x green pepper, quartered, deseeded and sliced tbsp. vegetable oil tbsp. turmeric tbsp. ground coriander tbsp. garam masala tbsp. curry powder x g tin chopped tomatoes x tbsp. tomato pureeg creamed coconut or  x g tin coconut milkg raw, large prawns, peeledHandful chopped coriander x lemon, juicedMethodIn a bowl, add flour, salt and water.

It was lovely to have them around and be able to cook a book where they could eat everything ndash both her parents are vegetarian.As well as being a way to bond with her family, Iyer fell in love with the therapeutic elements of barbecuing. ldquoIt was probably just being outside a lot, she confesses. ldquoI wrote the book during the first lockdown ndash I was in my parentsrsquo garden and I didnrsquot want to spend any time indoors, because it felt strange to be in that lockdown situation.ldquoI was even doing all the prep outside.

But let us work for now on the very reasonable assumption that Nicola Sturgeon will be ing to work on Monday as the First Minister of Scotland. What will immediately confront her Self-evidently, the Covid crisis ndash and its concomitant economic challenges. However, along with that, she will have to form a new Cabinet. One third of the previous team stood down at the election.Read more from Brian Taylor: Parties united by one thing: a desire for voters to just move onSo Ms Sturgeon will have to govern in future without the sagacious counsel of Aileen Campbell, Roseanna Cunningham, Jeane Freeman and Michael Russell.Ms Sturgeon may also take the opportunity to reshape her Cabinetrsquos structure and responsibilities, while preserving gender balance.That Cabinet exodus is matched in the lower Ministerial ranks and on the back benches. In addition, elections tend to generate involuntary departures. Democracy would notwithout such Parliamentary churn, however hard it is for iniduals.All the newbies ndash on all sides of the chamber ndash will need to learn, and quickly: not least because the anxious citizens of Scotland want speedy action in the continuing contest with coronavirus. When will we be safe  Where can we go on holiday Those decisions are urgent. Ms Sturgeon previously promised that there would be a further liberalisation on May , with Scotland generally ing to Level  constraints. If we all obey the rules.As for international travel, the UK Government has now set out its thinking. The Scottish Government has tended to favour a more cautious approach. Again, urgently, Ms Sturgeon will seek to revive a four-nation UK deal.Why four nation  Because it is simpler to explain and administer, it deters Scots from heading south of the border to get round Scottish rules: and, bluntly, it provides additional protection for the FM against complaints from Scots who might be super-angryEngland gets a more open deal.In tandem with action on the virus, Ms Sturgeon willto Ministerial briefing boxes brimming with information about the economy. Here is a hint: the data will not be universally positive.No doubt her attention will be drawn to a report from the Bank of England forecasting that the UK economy will enjoy record economic growth in , perhaps around . per cent. That is founded on expectations of higher confidence among consumers, happy with the vaccine numbers.However, Nicola Sturgeon will need no reminding that this possible uplt follows a calamitous slump last year, when the economy shrank by nearly ten per cent the most precipitous drop in three centuries.She knows too that the voters will expect delivery of the spending promises made in her manesto: more money for health, education, housing and social care. All within a balanced budget, constrained still further by a pledge to freeze Scottish income tax rates and bands.That promise, mirrored by other parties, was designed to reassure fretful voters. Starting today, it too has to be delivered.Then there is the related issue of securing Parliamentary support for budget proposals. That depends on the final Holyrood numbers.If she gains an overall majority, then she has only to sustain discipline in her own ranks. However,she is dependent once more upon the Greens for budgetary support, there could be some trouble ahead.The Greens tend to push for radical fiscal change for example, arguing during the campaign that Scotland should seek ways to tax wealth as well as income.They will also press Nicola Sturgeon to support swter curbs on the extraction of North Sea oil. Ministers back a move away from fossil fuels but worry about the immediate impact on jobs, arguing for a justtransition.If it comes to it, they may have to remind the Greens that big parties have rights too.Then the fundamental contest. Independence. Boris Johnson is expected to reach out to Scotland with measures designed to promote the Union and stress UK clout. One or two Tories mutter privately that such an initiative might have been handy before the election, not after.The Prime Minister will also face pressure to spell out whether he would consent to indyref. But not perhaps immediately. Ms Sturgeon herself is in no particular hurry.She knows that anxious voters will expect a laser focus on recovering from coronavirus.More, the FM fully understands that the independence offer in Scotland has always been predicated upon confidence.

It is a scenario that will be familiar to many Scottish voters, for this has been the  Days Later election for these pandemic times.Anything that involved coming within two metres of a stranger was out of the question . So cheerio doorstep debating, rallies, walkabouts, all the usual fun and games, and hello masks and Zoom.The battle began in routine fashion with the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament. Some MSPs were not seeking re-election, among them Ruth Davidson, who was leaving to spend more time with her ermine.For everyone  it was off to the constituency or region to prepare for government. Or,you were a Scottish Labour candidate, to prepare your excuses. With Anas Sarwar in charge there was a certain spring in the partyrsquos step, with the new leader even joining in with an outdoors exercise class dancing to Uptown Funk. Yes sir, he can boogie.Willie Rennie continued his quest to stage the most ridiculous photo op ever, with shots of the LibDem leader at a penguin parade, in a giant deckchair, and boxing. Not wishing to be left out, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross continued his partyrsquos tradition of clambering on to the nearest military vehicle, in his case an armoured personnel carrier. And he wasnrsquot even campaigning in Castlemilk.Mr Ross received a lot of help from his predecessor, Ms Davidson, who even fronted the party political broadcast. Her omnipresence contrasted with the complete absence of Boris Johnson. Having said that wild horses wouldnrsquot keep him away, the Prime Minister preferred to stay in London and dodge questions about gold wallpaper rather than take his chances with rebellious Scots .Try as the parties did to generate excitement, the campaign was proving as empty and devoid of interest as Celticrsquos trophy cabinet. Then it happened. Cue movie trailer voice guy: ldquoThe sky darkened. Birds ceased singing. Jaws dropped. HE was back. And this time HE had brought a whole new party with him. After the initial shock of Alex Salmondrsquos , observers turned to more serious matters, like how to pronounce the Alba Partyrsquos name. Some said ldquoAlapa others ldquoWallopers. Mr Salmond came bearing the promise of a ldquosupermajority of independence-supporting MSPs who would make Johnson an offer he could not refuse.The media was delighted to see theof Mr Salmond, and reporters were soon asking SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonshe would work with her predecessor. Ms Sturgeon gave the impression she did not wish to be on the same continent as her old boss, never mind in coalition with him.The SNP leader conducted a lot of her campaign from her by-now-famous conservatory. FDR had his fireside chats, Nicola has natters in the greenhouse. Consensus had it that the election was in the bag for her. It only remained to be seenshe would win a majority, and which party would take second place to the SNP, the Conservatives or Labour.The TV debates gave voters a chance to see the party leaders in action. Not all the leaders, however. BBC Scotland and STV limited participation to the five largest parties in the Scottish Parliament, which meant no podium for Mr Salmond or George Galloway, the leader of the All for Unityparty.Mr Galloway tried to whip up interest in a mano a mano with the Alba leader, moderated by Andrew Neil. Viewers might have been interested had David Attenborough not featured extensive scenes of walruses fighting in his last televisual masterpiece.So five went off to debate, with Sarah Smith and Glenn Campbell holding the jaikets for the BBC, and Colin Mackay doing the same for STV. Channel rsquos Krishnan Guru-Murthy came all the way from London town to show us he was as familiar with Scottish politics as Donald Trump was with third-wave feminism.The televised debates were missing a live audience in the studio, and turned out to be horribly dull in consequence. Scottish Greens co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater ided the debate work between them, though Steve Arnott-dress-a-like Harvie hogged more of the limelight.Anas Sarwar adopted a ldquoWhy canrsquot we be friends approach to the debates, albeit the offer clearly did not extend to the Conservatives, who were the focus of everyonersquos attacks. Douglas Ross seemed spectacularly cross in most of the encounters, while Ms Sturgeon tried hard not to look humongously smug or bored.Election day arrived, and with it the chance to exercise that age-old right to take a photie of the dug at a polling place and post it on Twitter.The one million Scots who had registered to vote by post had already done their bit, quietly and without fuss, in keeping with the mood. In one final insult from the heavens, the counts were not starting till the morning after, so voters were denied the thrill of spending the night with Kirsty Wark and Bernard Ponsonby.It had been that kind of election, that kind of year.

But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating. Nicola Sturgeon hasnrsquot officially committed to a timescale, other than the first half of the next parliamentary term, but it would appear that the media is setting the ball rolling by proposing such a timeline. As much as I have criticised the SNP for pedalling talks of Indyref during a pandemic, journalists are also guilty of fuelling the debate and diminishing print space or airtime for more immediate and pressing issues.Over the past week I have been moving into my new house, which has involved many hours of deep cleaning whilst tuned in to my radio and coverage of the election.Hats off to BBC Radio Scotland team for managing to fill three daysrsquo worth of election coverage with very little to report on other than the one major news story: would the SNP gain a majority Although they covered results and reaction across the entire country, the main topic on every reportersrsquo lips was whether the SNP would have a mandate to hold another referendum. So, for every listener tuned in, we are being told that this is the discussion we need to be having, this is the headline we should all be taking away.In between googling tutorials on how to sand kitchen worktops, I checked in to the community Facebook page for my local village and was struck by the fact that none of the members were remotely engaged in discussions over the election, let alone independence. Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons.

MaybeI just hold my breath and look to the side. So I did. I hugged him and it was the most precious, liberating thing. In the next few weeks, all going well, lots of us will be hugging again, remaking those glorious physical connections with family and friends and catching up on those hug IOUs.But what about all the other hugs  The workplace hugs, the first-time-yoursquore-meeting someone hugs, the awkward is-this-a-hug-or-an-air-kiss hug, the unwanted hug, the overly-long hug, the badly-timed hug.:Uzma Mir: Why cant Scots, in Scotland, use Scots words, without being called jakeys I think the time has come to review the strategy on them, because Irsquove come to realise Irsquom not a naturally huggy person, especially outside of my family, but lsquofitting inrsquo has somehow forced me to become more tactile and less assertive about what I actually want. Now the pandemic has shone a light on this aspect of human interaction, and Irsquom thinking perhaps we are all due a hug correction or at least a reassessment of who we are hugging and why.Since I started working over  years ago, things have become a lot huggier. In those days there were handshakes, smiles and occasional cheek-pressing which I must confess to never being comfortable with either.Meeting new colleagues in pre-covid times inexplicably brought hugs, despite the fact I would often fire out a hand as a pre-emptive strike, only for it to be metaphorically brushed away before the ritualistic meaty slapping together of two torsos. I mean, it would take a strong person to say lsquosorry, Irsquom not really a huggy personrsquo to the boss, so, in I would go for that awkward work hug followed by a flurry of back-patting.In fact, just last week I met my new boss for the first time in a Glasgow hotel. Although we had had quite a few Zoom meetings, I was surprised to see she was very tall, so did a silent lsquohallelujahrsquo that we couldnrsquot hug, because my head would have been at her chest level, which might have been weird.I then proceeded to nearly poke her in the midrf with a badly targeted elbow bump. Bring back the taciturn nodding of the old days, please, and release me from my confused social cues hell.This has more than a little to do with being brought up with dferent cultural values. My mum, who grew up in a small town in Pakistan, could never get her head round the Hogmanay hugging and kissing from slightly merry complete strangers. Every New Year party we went to, we would search for her only to find that she had locked herself in the loo for about  minutes after the Bells to avoid said hugs.I do wonder after years of hugging being de rigeur, what effect,any, Covid awareness will have on those previously encouraged to hug. Like men, for example.They have become much more huggy than I ever remember. Sportsmen, politicians, technicians at NASA after a successful space mission, faith leaders, movie stars, health workers ndash have all been relishing good, ostentatious, st century hugs with one another.Theyrsquove been told hugging helps to reduce stress, could protect them from illnesses, can alleviate loneliness and can make them happier by causing the release of oxytocin ndash a hormone that induces relaxation and lowers anxiety.

On a serious note, most of those whorsquove gone through lockdowns alone will be in desperate need of human connection, so the rest of us should be there for them.For me, I think Irsquom going to be braver about telling people I donrsquot know or who I donrsquot want to hug, that Irsquom not a huggy person.

I can even remember my next-door neighbour, a young friend of mine, being encouraged by his father to throw a Conservative Party leaflet back at a canvasser who had dared to try and put it through his letter box.The Tories, under Margaret Thatcher, were not best loved up north.The more left wing I became the worse the Conservatives Party appeared to be, and it was often they more than any other party who were most keen to use the police to get their way.Whether it was the policing of the miners strike, the criminalisation of homosexuality or the harassment of black people in the inner-city, it was the Establishment, the right-wing press and the Tory government who rightly stood accused of being authoritarian defenders of upper-class interests.Today, in England at least, voting patterns appear to be changing, and people, like the voters in Hartlepool, have again given a body blow to the Labour Party. Who it is that represents the Establishment appears to have changed. We find that, confusingly for some, the Tories now appear to be turning into the party of the working class.:Stuart Waiton: Scots university suspends lecturer as sop to woke warriorsAt least part of the reaction against Labour in England is down to the fact that the Labour Party essentially rejected the Brexit vote and, on many issues, appear to have become the voice of the politically correct.Refusing to accept a democratic vote is never the best advertisement for a political party and portraying the white working class as a bunch of deplorable racists is not likely to appeal to these voters.In Scotland, things are both dferent and the same.Many Scottish voters detest the authoritarian nature of the SNP. However, it is not only the SNP but, sadly, also Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, who act as a unied blob when it comes to passing laws and using the police to get their way.:Stuart Waiton: Trigger warnings for students are a threat to tough realities of learningUnhappy with the way some parents bring up their kids  Pass a law, create a Named Person and police the ldquowellbeing of every child in Scotland. Outraged by parental use of physical chastisement  Make it a crime.Sick of the foul-mouthed mob who sing offensive songs at football matches  Pass a law, call in the police, arrest those deplorable people. And, of course, we now have the Hate Crime Act that makes being offensive in your own home a potential crime.On all of these issues, the blob, the new establishment, vote as one. And it is they who today use the police to enforce their will onto the people.In comparison, the Tories, just by standing still, by thinking itrsquos probably not best to arrest parents for giving their kids a light smack or thinking it may not be a good thing to arrest people for saying ldquoincorrect things in their own home, suddenly find themselves as the anti-establishment party.Of course, the extent to which we can trust the Tories to defend peoplersquos basic freedoms and to hold back this tide of policing everyday le is highly debatable. Indeed, this election saw few of these issues being raised and all of the parties appeared to be happy to play the Union versus IndyRef card and discuss almost nothing .:Stuart Waiton: Giving prisoners the vote undermines democracyThe SNP continue to be able to act as the anti-establishment party by shouting ldquoWestminster, while continuing to turn themselves into a woke, authoritarian and anti-democratic institution.And so, we are left in limbo.

The grim and dficult period during the parliamentary inquiry and the apparent fragmentation of the independence movement, combined with a failing policy agenda and the wear and tear of  years in government did not generate an inspiring context for what was billed by many as the most important election since devolution.Add to that a year of pandemic uncertainty and the accompanying restrictions preventing rallies, canvassing and public meetings, building momentum and excitement in these circumstances is not an easy thing to achieve.Yet we saw record turnouts. And despite a rocky period, Nicola Sturgeon s as an immeasurably strengthened First Minister. Some have argued that the SNP, having just missed an outright majority, failed to meet its electoral objective. But this was always a more unlikely possibility.It has without doubt been a triumph for the party ndash and especially its leadership. Internally, the First Minister has restored discipline, with her opponents now neutralised. Some of these joined Alba, another source of potential headaches extinguished, having failed to make an electoral breakthrough. The Greens, with their eight MSPs combine to form a pro-independence majority with a clear mandate for a referendum.:Iain Macwhirter: It was an SNP landslide, but dont expect an early IndyrefIt is therefore unsurprising that the post-election coverage and analysis has focussed on what this means for the Union and in particular about the possibility of a new vote on independence. It is notable that SNP representatives feel quite at home with this discussion. Since they have already set in place the frame that there will be no referendum until the Covid crisis passes, they have time. But they also have the added bonus of being able to play out ndash after all, lots of it is pantomime ndash the rhetorical battle that pitches the sovereignty of the Scottish people against an ailing Westminster establishment.Read more: Scotland needs vision ndash not business as usual ndash to recover from pandemicWe are far away from a referendum in reality ndash and not just because waiting until the passing of the Covid crisis feels similar to waiting until the ldquofog of Brexit clears. But because the wrangling over the terms of a referendum could be a drawn-out process. Evenone is eventually accepted, we could be looking at changes to the question, demands for a threshold majority to be met, or for the outcome of negotiations after a referendum, should it be successful, to be tied to a confirmatory vote.All of these are important issues that the independence movement must debate and be attuned to. But it would be a profound mistake to focus on these mechanics at the expense of building a popular and coherent vision for Scotland as an independent nation.Kate Forbes speaks as she retains her seat of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch constituencyTo be blunt, beyond the soundbites, the SNP leadership does not have this in place. The ease and flow of the answers around Scotlandrsquos right to decide are not on display when questions are asked about economic strategy, borders, currency, or the dficulties of re-joining the European Union. Indeed, the current approach seems to defer these challenges: ldquoWe will set out our plans in due course.That is not convincing, but it is perhaps understandable as the outdated Growth Commission lingers around somewhat awkwardly. At a time when state intervention in the economy is seen as a requirement to rebuild from the pandemic, even by erstwhile neoliberals, the SNP is armed with a document that could have been written in the mid-s.When SNP Finance Secretary Kate Forbes was asked about currency during the election, she repeated the now infamous line that Scotland would move to a new currency only after a period of Sterlingisation in which six tests would have to be met. Not only would these tests be near-impossible to meet, even the most generous estimate involves a period of at least  years without a central bank.:English Tory triumph means that independence is our last refuge, by Kevin McKennaYet the architect of this policy, Andrew Wilson, said in an interview after the election that Scotland required the ldquofirepower of an independent country to recover from the pandemic. It just doesnrsquot tally. Without a central bank, borrowing would be set at a premium and quantitative easing made impossible. If the argument is that political independence is required to build Scotland anew, free from the shackles of Tory rule at Westminster, then it follows that economic sovereignty is not an optional extra, but a fundamental necessity.This is not an era for resuscitating fading orthodoxies, though some are desperate to cling to them. The poverty and inequality that has been so exposed during the last year demands an alternative. As we move forward we need an economic and social renewal that only a democratic revolution can bring about. In this sense, independence is either an insurgency against a failed system, or it is merely a nationalist flag -hanging exercise.Read more: Scotland must have the full powers of independence to deal with the economic legacy of CovidThe last referendum was not some dry, constitutional debate. It was a rebellion against austerity, the betrayals of New Labour and a conductor for deeply-felt resentment at political institutions that might as well have been built on a dferent planet. This political awakening shook the halls of power ndash and demanded a better society. The yearning for a new referendum among independence supporters is not just motivated by winning independence, but re-animating that spirit.While  cannot be repeated, nor can a referendum or, indeed, independence be won without the energy that drove that movement. It cannot be left to politicians to do the negotiating behind closed doors. It cannot be left to corporate lobby groups to design economic plans that prioritise the interests of City and the Scottish establishment.The SNP is in a strong position. But that demands action. No more obfuscation ndash but a galvanising plan to move forward. The negotiations for a referendum should start in earnest in order that a vote can be delivered in the first half of this parliament. The Growth Commission must be scrapped ndash urgently ndash so that a transformational prospectus which includes economic control can be developed.It is time to reinvigorate the debate about what the future of Scotland should look like ndash and to do so outside the boardrooms, the television studios and, potentially, the courts. As much as the discussion of how a referendum is brought about dominates, we need also to inject a vision of why independence is desirable in the first place.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

As we do so, we must learn the lessons of earlier referendums.Echoing Alex Salmondrsquos ldquothe dream will never die after a - result, his Brexit counterpart Nigel Farage said on the night of the vote: \"If it is - Remain, this would be unfinished business by a long way. Subsequent events show that a narrow victory for either side just produces deeper isions. If  per cent is too low for the nationalists, the first lesson we learn is that we will need a two-thirds Yes vote for independence to succeed with the full acceptance of the population ndash Yes and No.The second lesson is that whatever is promised by politicians in any referendum campaign is not what will be delivered in any final deal. In the case of the  indyref, for example, the Yes campaign promised us a currency union with rUK and automatic EU membership. Neither of these was deliverable unilaterally, or probably at all. The final terms of leaving the UK would have been as dferent to those of the White Paper as the pledges of Michael Gove and Boris Johnson were to the final Brexit terms.The same will apply in indyref ndash for example, the issues of currency, share of debt, EU membership, borders and customs and arrangements will not be in the gt of the Scottish Government. There is therefore a cast-iron case to offer voters a confirmatory vote when the outcome of new independence negotiations are concluded.

She should be promising the same ndash and safeguards against a catastrophic victory for the minority ndash right now.What is she scared of Peter A Russell, Glasgow.ITS TIME TO LANCE THE BOILAS a unionist I find myself agreeing with Mark Eadies view that an independence vote must go ahead . The thought of another five years of listening to the whingeing and whining of the SNP while the day job gets ignored will do Scotland nothing but further harm.I believe we have reached the point where the boil that is the constitution issue must be lanced, and the sooner the better.Ive never been fully convinced that Nicola Sturgeon actually wants another referendum. She is reliant on unionist resistance to having one and while that situation remains so does her power base. She knows that to lose would be the end of the matter and probably the SNP.I now believe there is a growing number of unionists who take a similar view to my own as we cannot go on as we are now.There are so many unanswered issues that the SNP hierarchy chooses to sidestep, however these would have to be debated once the gun is fired for a referendum.Here are just a few: currency, fiscal matters, jobs, borders, tax, not forgetting the cost of separation. They were quick to tell us the number of job losses for Brexit, but Ive never heard them say what the figure would be for leaving the UK. No point in scaring the horses.I think when the Scottish electorate learn what awaits them they will not choose austerity on stilts that will last years. The zealots will not care but the majority will.Roy B Hudson, Bearsden.PUT DEVO MAX ON THE BALLOTTHOSE with long memories and an internationalist outlook may be feeling a sense of whats called deja vu in Quebec. The Quebecois community organised two referenda: the first in , which led to a   majority against independence for Quebec. The second referendum in  was extremely close, less than a percentage point separating the two camps. Can we learn from their precedent  Both Quebec and Scotland claimed high-profile sympathisers for independence: de Gaulle for Quebec, and Sean Connery for Scotland.Returning to Scotlands own independence referendum in : as I recall, polls showed a majority in favour of devo max: that meant increased powers for the Holyrood parliament. Gordon Brown was called into action, giving a rousing speech promising additional powers for Holyrood within the current Union. We all know what ensued: David Cameron weaselled out of any such pledge, offering English votes for English laws instead. Then came Brexit ndash another Cameron fiasco, and fresh cause for Scottish discontent.As we have observed, Brexit has been an untidy business, especially in Northern Ireland. Last weeks poll results indicate a Tory \"border wall\" of EU Remainers and Leavers either side of Berwick. If an EU Customs border for goods were relocated to the A and M in place of the Irish Sea, that would allow Scots to enjoy both EU and UK benefits ndash having our cake and eating it.There is no legal requirement for a referendum poll to be binary and isive: why not offer a third, devo max option  Scotlandsto the EU customs union, with reinstatement of ferry links from Rosyth to Belgium or the Netherlands, would benefit trade.Graeme Orr, Neilston.THE UNION IS A LOST CAUSETHE man who gave us the vow in  , the man who broke the Vow, can he be trusted  Of course I speak of Gordon Brown, now calling for a four nations approach to saving the Union . Did he miss something  Surely he did not miss the Holyrood election results, where a clear message came forth Mr Brown and other unionists take note, the people of Scotland have spoken and will no longer be pulled into your web of deceit. The majority from those elected to serve were elected on manestos clearly backing indyref and the time will come for that manesto pledge to be delivered meantime it is the global pandemic that must take priority, as the First Minister has said all along.

Of course, all  Lords and Ladies could not be there, but there was enough of them on show to remind us that the House of Lords is the only upper house of any bicameral parliament in the world to be larger than its lower house, and that not one of those peers has been elected by anyone.I note that in the Queens Speech there was a pledge to support democracy around the world given the result of last weeks Scottish Parliament elections, it is to be hoped that the man who wrote the speech will bear in mind that democracy should begin at home.Ruth Marr, Stirling.Read more: If you dont want indie, why not be brave enough to hold a vote against it "},{"url":null,"title":"letters-no-right-disrespect-cultures-disregarding-languages-names","story":"We in the West protest about Chinarsquos treatment of the Uighurs and her efforts to impose a Han Chinese monoculture in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong.

The most famous example is probably Nelson Mandela, who became Nelson only after he was given that fine British name on his first day at school.In his autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom, Mandela remarks in the first paragraph that his given first name is Rolihlahla, which in Xhosa has a colloquial meaning of ldquotroublemaker.

The anglicised name of Auchinleck is derived from the Gaelic Achadh nan Leacand a scan of any ancient map will show numerous place names all over Scotland starting with Auch from the Gaelic achadh . In the th century mostnot all of Scotland spoke Gaelic, to be replaced over time with Scots, Lallans and others.The Daily Review of  published a letter by D. Murray-Lyon of Ayr of which the following is a short extract: ldquoGaelic was to some extent spoken in Ayrshire in the early part of shellip. Margaret McMurray who died at a very advanced age about the year , was long talked about as being the last Gaelic-speaking native of Carrick.By way of supporting her case, Ms Judge says Robert Burns would have written his poems in Gaelic, but it had long died out in Ayrshire by Burnsrsquos time and also ignores the dficulty of doing so in these troubled times. Westminster introduced the Act of Proscription of  which applied to \"that part of Great Briton called Scotland and included among a long list of other things, a ban on all forms of Highland clothes under penalty of imprisonment for a first offence and transportation to one of His Majestyrsquos plantations for seven years for a second offence. Although Gaelic was not banned as such, parents could only send their children to schools registered under the above act where Gaelic was not taught, was discouraged and those who spoke it were frequently punished with the tawse. As a government exciseman, any attempt by Burns to compose his poetry in Gaelic would have faced severe retribution.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.* CELIA Judge is mistaken.

It could re-join as an independent country and it could re-join as part of the UK. Given the current state of UK and Scottish politics, rejoining as an independent state currently looks more likely. And, on top of that, EU attitudes towards the UK rejoining in the next decade are currently rather negative where there is some EU sympathy towards Scotland.The EU has a clear accession process that an independent Scotland would have to follow. This already assumes that Scotland had become independent via a legally and constitutionally sound route and had recognition both from the rest of the UK and from EU member states.:What will happenPM rejects a second independence referendum  Iain Macwhirter answers your questionsAs a first step, the Scottish Government would have to apply for membership. In Brussels, the European Commission would respond by assessing whether Scotland, as a European state, was a well-ing democracy and market economy andit was capable of taking on all the EUrsquos laws and rules. If this was positive, Scotland would then have candidate status and in due course, negotiations would start. To get that far would require the unanimous agreement of all the EU: the accession process is political as well as technical.As the second big step, the talks would start and would be structured around  so-called chapters which cover a range of issues in great detail including the single market, transport, agriculture, fisheries, foreign policy, economic policy and much much more. If Scotland applied by, say, , its laws would probably still be fairly closely aligned to EU laws so its accession process would be much quicker than that of countries such as Estonia or Poland.But there would still be tricky issues. Talks would cover the EU customs union, so the question of Scotlandrsquos border to England ndash as an external EU border ndash would come up. Scotland would have to commit to join the euro eventually though it would be unlikely to meet the criteria for joining straight away ndash so it would join the non-euro group of member states. And its fiscal deficit would have to conform with EU rules or be on a clear trajectory towards meeting those rules.Scotland might need to ask for transition periods in some areas but these could not be many or major. The one exception might be the border-free Schengen area where Scotland, like Ireland, might request an opt-out in order to stay in the UK Ireland common travel area.Once talks are complete, the third big step can happen. The Commission recommends that the EU agree Scotlandrsquos accession treaty ndash again, a unanimous vote. If the EUrsquos leaders agree, then the accession treaty is signed, then ratied by each member state .

Thursday  May.Nicola Sturgeon will be the first to do so at am on Thursday.This must be done in English, but members are allowed to repeat in their chosen language.Its expected that new MSPs will deliver their oath in a iety of languages, from Scots to Doric, Orcadian, German, Urdu and Zimbabwean Shona.Many MSPs might also take the oath in the Scottish manner, with an uplted hand but not holding the bible.They can also choose to wear their own national dress, with SNP members John Swinney, Fulton MacGregor and Humza Yousaf wearing kilts in .For the swearing-in ceremony for thefth

of our areas, such as Inverclyde, the rates are still low.\"\" alt\"HeraldScotland: Cases have been rising recently in Glasgow city \" class\"editor-image\"Cases have been rising recently in Glasgow city Dr de Caestecker told BBC Scotlands Drivetime programme that the spike seemed to be linked to \"households mixing together\", according to data being gathered by contact tracers through Test and Protect.She said: \"I think as the rates go down, people feel well, were going to be relaxing restrictions very soon anyway.\"Weve got evidence that there is more social mixing happening in some of these areas...it is household clusters were seeing, concentrated in specic postcodes.\"People living in affected areas are being encouraged to pick up free rapid testing kits eventhey have no

transmissible\" as the Kent iant, but there has also been growing evidence - from India and parts of England - that it seems able to outcompete it.Brazilian, South African and Nigerian iants of concern have also been found in Scotland, however.: Why UK scientists are growing worried about the Indian iantDr de Caestecker said public health teams are working to get on top of the increases so that Glasgow can move into Level Two restrictions as planned from Monday, but cautioned that she was \"worried about this increase\".\"Were working really hard to get on top of it quickly and make sure that we dont let it spread further...so that there is reassurance that we can all move to these lower levels.\"We have to look not just at the rates but the hospitalisations, the numbers of people in ICU.\"Between now and Monday - its not for me to say what the levels will be - but at the moment we are still anticipating we will move to a lower level on Monday, but we will be doing everything we can to manage this increase in cases in some defined areas of Glasgow city.\"Scottish Government data shows that there are currently  Covid patients in hospital across the Greater Glasgow and Clyde region.This is down from a spike in admissions earlier this month, which saw the number of people in hospital in NHS GGC with recently diagnosed Covid double from  on May  to  by May

high, still in the s, but we want it to be well into the s.\"She added that some of the localised increases in infection also correlated with Black, Asian, and minority ethnic communities where there is more vaccine hesitancy.\"There is some evidence that they are more affected by this [increase],\" said Dr de Caestecker.\"Theres a higher number of these groups in the populations in these

For many islanders, who have been living with low levels of the virus for months, this easing cannot come quickly enough.ldquoI know that itrsquos been a real source of frustration for many that strict restrictions have lingered on even despite the consistently low prevalence rate and the incredibly rapid vaccine roll-out.ldquoTo finally be able to hug our loved ones will be a huge relief. Itrsquos something that many of us wonrsquot take for granted ever again.ldquoLooking ahead, the work for the recovery is only just beginning. With so many businesses on the edge and mental health really suffering, there needs to be openness about what support will look like during the recovery.ldquoWhile new freedoms will feel good, it will also be important to remember that many will feel anxious about restrictions easing.

I have been encouraged, though, by the new five per cent deposit mortgages the government are backing. I hope that could be really helpful.“Lenders are also starting to offer mortgages at five and a half times buyers’ earnings as opposed to four or four and a half times, so that will also help with how much people can borrow.”He added: “Because of the proximity to the schools and Portree it is not going to appeal to people who are looking to buy a holiday home. They want to be in the middle of nowhere.“I think it is going to appeal to people who are looking to buy it as their main home and want access to the schools and decent internet so they can work.”As an extra incentive the developer plans to connect all the houses via a full fibre GB broadband connection to the nearby BT exchange.“This connection will be provided by us completely free of charge for the first five years,” he added.“This is possible because the capacity we will have for the hotel is well beyond what we will need. This is still subject to BT surveys, though, but it is a realistic aspiration.”The housing scheme, which Mr Garton Jones describes as “an amalgam of Highland and Scandinavian culture” has been designed by Plockton-based architect Olli Blair, who caught the eye of the developer with his work on the Raasay Distillery building.Mr Garton Jones said he hoped to get on site by September October this year.The Bracken Hide Hotel is scheduled to open in April .If anyone is looking for more information on the homes or to register an interest they can contact Mr Garton Jones via charlie@gartonjones"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WATERNISH-CYCLE-1.jpg","title":"waternish youngsters raise more than 7000 with","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoinePat Matheson from Halistra lost her husband Campbell to the illness, and her family thought it would be a good idea to raise funds for the charity in memory of Campbell and to raise awareness of AMMF.

There was a huge amount of rope and all sorts of litter.“Beyond that there was general litter such as Coke bottles, beer cans, and a few face masks. The only odd thing we found was a massive oxygen tank.”Highlighting the volume of rubbish encountered during the clean, he added: “Nearly everyone who came along was from the community and they had seen this litter building up over the last two years.“The beach clean is an annual event we tend to do in April but we had to cancel last year’s so this year is basically two years’ worth including two winter storms’ worth.”When asked how much of the responsibility for the mess he believed lay with local people, he went on to say: “Some of the litter will certainly be from local industry but so much of it will be dropped from people on the island – whether locally or swept in.“The problem is not just local to here, it’s a UK-wide issue.”Addressing the challenges facing the village more broadly, Mr Watson said: “On Friday one of our contractors pulled up two trailers of fly-tipped metal down the side of one of the bridges away from the beach.“That has been years’ worth of local people dumping bikes, climbing frames and all sorts of bits and pieces.

Personally I would think social housing should be a priority.”While Helen Grianan said: “Will these houses be £, or under  If not, they are not affordable housing for locals or key workers.”Calum J Morrison from North Uist was in favour of the scheme saying: “Sounds like a good type of thing in my opinion, the dude seems to know what he’s doing, good luck to him I say!”Annie B Campbell, meanwhile, highlighted broader issues with housing on the island, stating: “Key workers, like some NHS and teachers, are being outbid for most of the houses that come on the market in Skye.“They are not ‘officially’ homeless so do not have enough points to qualy for council housing.“Some are forced to skip between illegal short term lets. This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3799783.jpg--.jpg?1620807562000\n","title":"canoe crews help clean up banks of the braid","story":"County Antrim Paddle Sportare asking the public ‘canoe help’ to clean up local river banks After a recent litter pick along the Braid River they managed to lt  refuse bags of general litter, three tyres, a plastic oil drum and piping, a bucket, and even a part of a low rider bike!

I know I’m breaching my tenancy but it is my son’s wedding and he has no other place to go.”The council was also given leave to broadcast the court’s orders on national radio stations even as the bride and groom and their guests were on their way from Co Armagh for today’s planned pm reception in Co Dublin.Mr Donovan said the gardaí were supporting the council’s application and when he asked Mr Connors to take the marquee down he replied: “I can’t take it down. My son’s wedding is going ahead and I accept the consequences of not taking it down.”Ms Neary, a solicitor in the legal department of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, said after the injunction application that the council would be moving immediately to take the marquee down or hire an independent contractor to do the work for it.Judge Ní Chulacháin said she noticed from photographs of the marquee taken by Mr Donovan that there were  tables surrounded by chairs in the marquee, enough chairs to accommodate more than  people.Mr Flynn told the court the council considered the planned reception to be a breach of Covid- regulations in the middle of a global pandemic as well as breaking a tenancy agreement. The local authority was also concerned about the lack of insurance cover for this evening’s event.Judge Ní Chulacháin gave the council leave to serve personal notice on Mr Connors and also pin up notices outlining details of the court’s orders. The judge also directed that everyone associated with the reception, including the bridal party and guests, be warned they had been restrained from entering the marquee.Mr Flynn indicated that the council had signicant concerns relating to the use of the marquee for the wedding reception which, he said, unless restrained by the court the Connors planned to go ahead with.Independent.ieMost ReadBody of Northern Ireland woman Suzanne Knowles missing in Spain is foundFirm behind Belfast’s Wellington Park Hotel is liquidatedDUP’s Donaldson takes swipe at Poots vowing to ‘vigorously oppose’ NI protocol and further disrupt North-South relationsArmagh newlyweds’ parents ordered to remove marquee ahead of wedding reception this evening in DublinChair of Loyalist Communities Council ‘astonished’ over Doug Beattie call to disband groupTop VideosPlayVideo: The baby elephant kept in Belfast backyard duringWorld War II Blitz PlayVideo: Lisa Dorrian murder suspect Mark Smyth taking Sunday Le’s lie detector test\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ba .ece AUTOCROP wh edcdebfcbaba.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ba .ece AUTOCROP wh edcdebfcbaba.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayBallymurphy families arrive home following the Ballymurphy inquest findings Latest Northern IrelandRobbie Butler rules himself out of Ulster Unionist Party leadership bidCovid diagnosis forces Seamus McGarvey to quit duties on Spider-Man filmSon of Ballymurphy victim rejects Prime Minister’s ‘third party apology’Prime Minister apologises for deaths in  of innocent people in BallymurphyMinisters told some citizenship rules ‘do not quite make sense’LatestVaradkar ‘increasingly confident’ over number of Covid jabsRobbie Butler rules himself out of Ulster Unionist Party leadership bidBilly Porter, Zachary Quinto and EJ Johnson join cast of Proud Family revivalHeathrow warns flights may be erted to other airportsCovid diagnosis forces Seamus McGarvey to quit duties on Spider-Man film,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

McKaigue has received the all-clear and has been involved in some of the football in recent weeks.Speaking last week, Gallagher feels McKaigue probably hasnt had the amount of football under his belt for the start of the league, with the management erring on the side of caution with histo action.“We believe he will be fully fit and available for the Longford game,” added the Derry boss who termed McKaiguesas brilliant news.“One thing for sure, his Achilles is  percent recovered,” Gallagher stated. “Will he pick up another setback  I dont believe he will, he looks in great nick but he just needs plenty of football.”Meanwhile, Gallagher is happy that another Slaughtneil duo, Chrissy McKaigue and Brendan Rogers, are back going well after going under the kne for knee injuries.Gallagher revealed that both were fortunate to feature in last Autumns Ulster championship defeat to Armagh.“They have had a lot of wear and tear over the last five, six, seven years, but they are back going well...they look after themselves phenomenally,” Gallagher added.“They were meniscus injuries, needing eight to nine weeks to recover. Theyplayed the latter stages of the club championship, the two National League gamesand the championship against Armagh, thats the type of characters we want.”Midfielder Padraig Cassidy was also playing through a niggly hip injury over the past few seasons for club and county. There were reports of surgery being required in the long-term and he managed his progress with injections, but Derry are boosted by his full recovery, having also been given the all clear at a clinic in Santry, following his rehabilitation programme.“Hehas worked phenomenally hard, often twice a day, and he is injury free,” Gallagher said of Cassidys progress. “He is totally injury free and moving really well. That is a massive plus as well.”Glens Jack Doherty, apart from a brief appearance in the McKenna Cup defeat to Monaghan in December , missed all of Derrys  season and Gallagher is happy to have him back in the selection mix.“He is fully fit and injury free. He looks good and is moving really well, has been able to do all the work and looks in good shape.”Ruairi Mooney also missed all of last season and Shea Downey, one of  players handed their inter-county senior debuts by Gallagher, are also back in full training.Gallagher stated that he had no long-term injuries in the -man squad, with Magherafelt defender Conor McCluskey the only one on the doubtful list for this weekend.“Clucky got a collision on his knee at training.

Shiels delivered the League Cup, their last piece of silverware. His son Dean was again part of the success in a - victory over Cobh Ramblers at the Brandywell. It wasnt enough to save his job. His tenure as manager coincided with the death of Derry skipper and club legend Ryan McBride, something that affected him badly. Kenny read out an emotional poem, In Your Absence, at Ryans funeral, which was greeted with a rapturous applause. “We lost eight players in the August of the third year,” Kenny states. “They wanted away some of them. I made a couple of bad signings, which you do.” Part of him wanted to stay, but he sensed an element of the dressing room wasnt in his corner. “I felt it,” he admits. “Ive always prided myself in having a good dynamic in the dressing room. In the professional game, you have a term where you are doing well and a term when it is not so good.” The mutual decision saw them part ways. He knows that bad times are inevitable. It could happen in his current role. “It happens to everybody,” Kenny admits. *** Carrick Rangers win over Glentoran was a seismic result in its own right, but one thing pleased Kenny Shiels more, watching his side pass them off the pitch. “I had a style of play and I still have it,” Kenny now states. “We got on the ball and we play, with our passing style and patterns.” He enjoys the tactical side of the game, but taking charge of Northern Ireland women was a dferent preposition. Transforming them into the first side to qualy for the European Championships is top of the tree in a footballing career that is glittered with success. “If you dig deep into it,” Kenny explains. “These girls hadnt won a match in almost four years, prior to us coming in.” Magherafelts Simone Magilland Rebecca Hollowayare the sole professional players. Sarah McFadden, also from Magherafelt, plays part-time with Durham. The rest are amateur. The fallow spell had corroded any bleak sign of confidence. Standing in Greenmount College, with felt tip pen in hand, their new manager steered his sides mentality in a very definite direction. Two words were etched onto the flip-chart...trust and integrity. His two cornerstones. “You cant have one without the other and I told them they were the focal points in their time with me,” Shiels said. “Thats what we work off, in everything we do. They are related to team spirit and teamwork in any sport.” Even now, sitting on his sofa, reciting that first meeting, his eyes are dancing. You can see how he was able to hold a team in the palm of his hand. It wasnt about just trusting each other. The squad needed to believe in the staff, the process of improvement. But, most of all, they had to trust themselves. “You cant get better without trust,” he told them. “The best and most important relationship you can have anywhere in the world, with any person...is the relationship with yourself. “If you dont trust and believe in yourself, and you havent got a strong relationship with yourself, youll never achieve anything in your le.” Shiels had to pick them off the canvas. Unlike a club environment, there is no transfer market. It was a case of building a team from scratch. In the opposite corner, they were pitting themselves against players from Barcelona and Lyon, stars from the top English clubs, Manchester City, Arsenal and Cha. “Wales, who we eliminated over two games, they have a full team, maybe  of them, playing in the Womens Super League,” Shiels adds. Their resolve was tested by two - defeats by former European and World Champions Norway, either side of their two draws with Wales. “My full backs go forward, we play an attacking game,” Shiels points out. “Norway beat us - in Belfast, but in the second half, we had the same or more possession than them and it was a great learning curve.” Northern Ireland finished the group with four wins, twice each against Belarus and the Faroe Islands to book their play-off with Ukraine. Simone Magill and Rachel Furness celebrate Northern Irelands - win over Belarus in the Dinamo National Olympic Stadium, Minsk.As part of the preparations, Shiels accepted an approach to play England in St Georges Park, something seen as a gamble of sorts. After rebuilding the confidence, a hiding, by more than six goals, couldve set them back. Trailing - after facing a stf breeze, Northern Ireland played much better in the second-half but went down - in the end, but Shiels was happy. It was another learning curve. Going into the first leg of the play-off, Shiels had four players out with cruciate ligament injuries, Lauren Wade had an ankle injury and goalscorer Rachel Furness hobbled off minutes with a broken ankle. A Magill goal saw Shiels side come home with a - win from Ukraine before winning - in the second leg, to book their place in the finals. “They have  million of a population and have recently been in the finals,” he said of Ukraines pedigree. Of the  teams in next summers finals, ranked by coefficient, only Scotland from the top  ranked teams have failed to qualy. Northern Ireland are ranked th. “We are in with the big shots now,” Shiels points out. The rankings are based on results, discipline, performances, essentially anything quantiable. “The coefficient we got in the fth year, was twice as much as the other four years combined. That is massive.” He has come a long way from dribbling through the tackles on the tarmac of Beagh Primary School, but Shiels is still leading the way. And hes far from finished.\",\"keywords\":\"free articles,Kenny Shiels,Northern Ireland,Roys Chicks,Maghera,Derry City,Soccer\",\"articleSection\":\"Home\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"Maghera man Kenny Shiels transformed theNorthern Ireland womens team, without a win for four years, to qualy for next summers European Championships.

Michael McMullan sat down to hear his story...From Kenny Shiels front door, through the hall and kitchen, into the sun-room of his Maghera home sets the scene. A framed Northern Ireland jersey on the wall. Snaps of his son Dean in the colours of Rangers and Hibernian, with three outstretched fingers symbolising his hat-tricks. A glistening picture of Kenny and Dean, grinning from ear to ear, with the Scottish League Cup after Kilmarnocks  success, sticks out from a row of framed mementos. There is no doubt this is a football house. Dean is now the manager of Dungannon Swts. His other son, Jody, manages the local cross community team Upperlands Aces where Kenny is the Chairman. googletag.cmd.push “It is only a title,” he admits. Football is in the blood. “I mark out the pitch, cut the grass...just trying to keep them going.” One of his daughters, Lauren, is married to Coleraine manager Oran Kearney. Armagh City manager Shea Campbell is married to Grace. His we Gwens brothers were footballers. You soon get the picture of the football discussion bouncing around the dinner table. On a Thursday afternoon, on the same day he signed a two-year extension to his contract as Northern Ireland womens manager, Shiels welcome is a warm one. He sips on a cuppa, relaxed, just shooting the breeze. Talking football comes naturally. googletag.cmd.push It was always football, even at the age of two. In hospital for a hernia operation, Kenny cried his eyes out. His mother, Elizabeth, tried to pacy him. But, it wasnt the pain, rather, someone had taken his ball. Once it was ed, the tears stopped. “It must be in my genes somewhere...I was football mad,” Kenny utters. He turned  weeks ago, but the glint remains in his eye. Before Covid- took hold, he was a regular at the nearby leisure centre. The mantra is early to bed, early to rise and practice what you preach. Another passion is music. Tucked in the corner of the kitchen is a record player, with a selection of LPs. Front of the pile is his favourite, John Prine.     “Music is just great,” Kenny offers, painting a picture of the power generated by Labi Sfres Something Inside So Strong. As the Northern Ireland team are about to leave their hotel, the words of the song set the scene. The song changes, depending on the atmosphere. The words and crescendo...they both matter. Shiels gained a degree in psychology along his footballing journey. As he speaks, he picks his words well. An hour in his company gives a taste of how Northern Ireland women, who went four years without a win, will mix with Europes elite next summer. *** Shiels first gig in management came in Beagh Primary School at the age of eight. The nearby, much bigger, Maghera County school came to play a friendly match. “Shiels...pick that team,” bellowed Principal Mr Gillen. “It was a hiding to nothing,” said Shiels of the game, in which he helped himself to five goals in an eight all draw. “There were no tactics,” Kenny laughs. “I got the ball and dribbled. They were trying to kick lumps out of me, but couldnt get near me.” Football was never away from the family home on a chicken farm on the outskirts of Maghera. Kenny was fourth of nine children, which included eight boys. Their father Roy had installed lights in the front yard. Every Saturday night, theyd re-emerge after Match of the Day, singing the tune as they raced outside, playing until after midnight. “My father was a Unionist Councillor...this town was polarised at one time,” Kenny points out. Roy Shiels was able to drink in any of the  pubs in Maghera. One of the few that could. “He got houses for everybody, no matter what creed they were...he was a very popular man.” With a deep interest in football, Roy formed a team comprising Catholics from the upper part of the town and Protestants from the bottom end. “He was bringing communities together to go and compete together in a sporting environment,” Kenny proudly states. “They came together and became friends to this day. Larry Cudden, who played for us, texted me a few minutes ago.” Roy took a cattle trailer, with the whole team in it and sometimes a couple in the boot of the car. It wouldnt conform with todays regulations. Roys Chicks, as they were called, hammered everyone in sight in tournaments across the North. After bagging seven goals in a game, Kenny was accused of being overage. The following year, the Chicks went international, on a five-day trip to France. Seamus Heffron, a French teacher on his year out, helped Roy organise the trip, which was funded by a raffle for a ball signed by the England and Spanish national teams. “Off they went to France, in the late seventies,” said Kenny, now too old to go. “Children got to Portrush for a weekend and that was it.” Kenny was football mad and sneaked away for a fleeting Gaelic football spell with Glen minors in , at the height of the troubles. On the Saturday evening hed leave a kitbag in a lane near his home. The following morning, his mother would have him kitted out in a shirt and tie for Sunday school. “I would change into my ordinary clothes and go on to a game,” he recalls. “Playing Gaelic, when I think back at the height of the troubles, I was mincemeat. It was a brave thing to do.” While his toe to hand wasnt up to scratch as a newcomer to the game, he just dribbled his way through defences. *** An ankle injury at the age of  threatened to end the promising Shiels football career. Medical advice told him to hang up his boots, but he ploughed on. He went on to play for Distillery, Coleraine, Ballymena and Larne in the Irish league. In his third spell with Tobermore United, as player manager, he brought home silverware before a call out of the blue gave him his big break in management. “It was the day of my fathers funeral,” Kenny remembers. “I can still see it. I came home from the funeral, I was hanging up my coat and the phone rang.” Bottom of the table Carrick Rangers were offering him the manager post. The following season, he led them to the County Antrim Shield. After a semi-final win over Glenavon, they defeated then league champions Glentoran in the final. “That was a fantastic giant killing act,” he said of their - replay win. The Glens had taken English professional player Billy Whitehirst for the final, whereas Kenny built a team by dipping into local junior clubs Roe Valley, Dungiven and Magherafelt Sky Blues. Brian Martin scored the first goal, with David Montgomery netting the winner. When Felix Healy resigned as Coleraine manager midway through the   season, a Bannsiders fan like his father, Shiels was headhunted to steer the ship. Coleraine narrowly missed out on a place in the top flight, as the old -team ision split into two leagues for the first time. The following season, with his younger brother Sammy banging in the goals, Kenny got Coleraine promoted and won the inaugural Irish News Cup, a competition for North West Clubs in the Irish League and League of Ireland. After six years with Coleraine, he had a spell with Moyola Park before taking charge of Ballymena United in mid-season. He was unable to save them from the drop to the second tier. After two seasons, which saw them finish as low as fth, Shiels rebuilt the team. His now son in law Shea Campbell was leading the attack when they gained promotion and with ex Nottingham Forest striker Nigel Jemson on board, they finished sixth in the top flight and qualied for Europe via the Intertoto Cup. Following a draw with Danish side Odense, they lost the second leg. After leaving the Showgrounds, Kenny took over at Larne, but at the time, he was appointed as manager of Northern Ireland Us, who he steered to the  European Championships. “That was the only time they qualied for Europe,” said Shiels. “We beat Belgium away and Scotland away to qualy, that was massive.” At the tournament in France, Northern Ireland came up against a Cesc Fagravebregas-led Spain and the hosts that included Karim Benzema. The eight years with the Us helped him secure a job in England, the Head of Youth at Tranmere Rovers, where he stayed for three seasons before taking over as Mixu Paatelainens number two at Kilmarnock. When Paatelainen moved to take charge of Finland, Shiels was promoted to manager. The  season proved to be a fantastic season. He became the first Killie manager to beat Rangers twice in one season. Ally McCoist was looking to equal an -year record by going  away games unbeaten, but Kilmarnock overturned them at Rugby Park. When the sides met in thefixture at a packed Ibrox, Shiels son Dean scored the  minute winner. In the League Cup, Kilmarnock went all the way to their final meeting with Celtic at Hampden Park without conceding a goal. Goalkeeper Cammy Bells inspirational performance kept a clean sheet in the decider. Shiels brought Lee Johnston and Dieter Van Tornhout off the bench, with both combining for the latter to score the winning goal to take the title and cap off a fine season. Kenny and Dean Shiels celebrate Kilmarnocks  Scottish Cup success. The following season, Shiels led Killie to victory over Celtic at Parkhead, but after finishing ninth in the table, triggering a get-out clause, allowed the club to sack him,they ended up in the bottom four. It sparked protests by fans, disappointed with the clubs decision. Shiels had spells at Scottish side Greenock Morton and BEC Tero Sasana in Thailand, before joining Derry City in . In his first two seasons, the Candystripes finished third and fourth, qualying for lucrative spots in Europe, where they beat Dinamo Minsk. “What a result that was,” Kenny said of the win. “It was the first game in their new refurbished stadium and I later took Northern Irelandback there when we played Belarus.” In his third season in charge, Derry City finished third bottom of the table following a poor run of results. Shiels delivered the League Cup, their last piece of silverware. His son Dean was again part of the success in a - victory over Cobh Ramblers at the Brandywell. It wasnt enough to save his job. His tenure as manager coincided with the death of Derry skipper and club legend Ryan McBride, something that affected him badly. Kenny read out an emotional poem, In Your Absence, at Ryans funeral, which was greeted with a rapturous applause. “We lost eight players in the August of the third year,” Kenny states. “They wanted away some of them. I made a couple of bad signings, which you do.” Part of him wanted to stay, but he sensed an element of the dressing room wasnt in his corner. “I felt it,” he admits. “Ive always prided myself in having a good dynamic in the dressing room. In the professional game, you have a term where you are doing well and a term when it is not so good.” The mutual decision saw them part ways. He knows that bad times are inevitable. It could happen in his current role. “It happens to everybody,” Kenny admits. *** Carrick Rangers win over Glentoran was a seismic result in its own right, but one thing pleased Kenny Shiels more, watching his side pass them off the pitch. “I had a style of play and I still have it,” Kenny now states. “We got on the ball and we play, with our passing style and patterns.” He enjoys the tactical side of the game, but taking charge of Northern Ireland women was a dferent preposition. Transforming them into the first side to qualy for the European Championships is top of the tree in a footballing career that is glittered with success. “If you dig deep into it,” Kenny explains. “These girls hadnt won a match in almost four years, prior to us coming in.” Magherafelts Simone Magilland Rebecca Hollowayare the sole professional players. Sarah McFadden, also from Magherafelt, plays part-time with Durham. The rest are amateur. The fallow spell had corroded any bleak sign of confidence. Standing in Greenmount College, with felt tip pen in hand, their new manager steered his sides mentality in a very definite direction. Two words were etched onto the flip-chart...trust and integrity. His two cornerstones. “You cant have one without the other and I told them they were the focal points in their time with me,” Shiels said. “Thats what we work off, in everything we do. They are related to team spirit and teamwork in any sport.” Even now, sitting on his sofa, reciting that first meeting, his eyes are dancing. You can see how he was able to hold a team in the palm of his hand. It wasnt about just trusting each other. The squad needed to believe in the staff, the process of improvement. But, most of all, they had to trust themselves. “You cant get better without trust,” he told them. “The best and most important relationship you can have anywhere in the world, with any person...is the relationship with yourself. “If you dont trust and believe in yourself, and you havent got a strong relationship with yourself, youll never achieve anything in your le.” Shiels had to pick them off the canvas.

The youngster has broken through to the first team and become a regular this season. He appeared as a substitute against St. Patrick’s Athletic in March, and he hasn’t left the team since, appearing in each of City’s last seven games. Boyce made his Derry City debut as a very late substitute against Shelbourne last October but has really come into his own this season and even scored his first senior goal in the - draw with Drogheda United at the Brandywell last month. Manager Ruaidhri Higgins explained that the decision to give Ronan his first professional contract was an easy one. googletag.cmd.push “He’s been brilliant from the minute I walked in the door,” he said. “Obviously I watched a few matches before I came in and he was very good in them games as well so it’s no surprise to me and it was something I wanted to do nearly straight away, and I’m delighted we have come to the long-term agreement with Ronan. “He’s very easy to work with he’s a dream actually. You can give a young player a long-term contract and they can rest on their laurels but that won’t be the case with Ronan. He just doesn’t have that in his make-up, and this will only make him stronger and give him a really good  to develop.” googletag.cmd.push The player himself is delighted to sign the new deal. “I’m buzzing with it to be honest,” he said. “I’m just glad that the club has shown a bit of faith in me and hopefully I can repay them now. I have felt good this season but I know I can still get better and still improve and hopefully I can just kick on and get better with every game. “No chance will I ever get comfortable with this. I just want to keep going and play at the highest level I can and hopefully fulfil my potential whatever that is.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dr Glynn said he is hopeful that additional measures will not be required for the county in the coming weeks and he is confident that the situation in Donegal will improve quickly. He was speaking at a press briefing for the media in Donegal on Wednesday following the fallout from comments made by chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan last Friday about the high incidence of Covid- in the county. googletag.cmd.push There has been a backlash in Donegal to the tone of the comments Dr Holohan made when he said there were concerns about things happening in the county that “even the dogs on the street” know shouldn’t be happening. Figures released at the press briefing put the national incidence rate in the county at  cases per , people compared to a national rate of . The highest rates are in the Milford local electoral area at . and the Letterkenny area where the rate is .. The lowest rate in the county is in the Donegal LEA at .. The briefing was told there were  GP referrals for testing in the county on Tuesday, an increase of % on the same day last week. googletag.cmd.push Dr Glynn said the concerns were raised last week so that people can take protective measures and ensure the situation does not get worse. He said there is a bigger number of smaller clusters in Donegal than in other parts of the country. “It was not meant as blame. It certainly was not made as a threat,” he said. “It would be very strange for us to preside over a situation where incidence is very high and increasing in a county and not draw attention to that.” At the briefing, director of public health for the HSE in the north-west, Dr Anthony Breslin, highlighted a number of clusters that have occurred due to events in the county in recent weeks, including awake, a family gathering and an th birthday party.     The events resulted in dozens of cases and infections in workplaces, in families and at a school. One social gathering has been linked to  cases of Covid-, he said. Dr Glynn said that there are concerns about the situation in the county and that some people in Donegal have “pushed the boundaries”. “We are concerned about the current incidence. That is not to say that Donegal has not come a very long way over the past number of months, just as the rest of the country has, and that can only have happened because the majority of people are trying to do the right thing,” he said. “This is not in any way a reflection on the majority but clearly there are a number of incidents where people have pushed the boundaries. “We have seen that in other counties, it is not just in Donegal. But I suppose the dference at the moment versus some other places where we have particularly high incidences, is that there are large clusters driving incidences. “In Donegal, it seems to be a little bit more widespread with a bigger number of smaller clusters which makes it that little bit harder to control. Sowe can continue to emphasise, andwe can get people who have been pushing the boundaries a little bit just to comply that bit more over the coming weeks, we should see incidence drop quickly in Donegal.” He said we can not get away from the fact that the high incidence rates in parts of the county are due to the fact the disease is being transmitted from person to person. “It gets transmitted from person to person when people come into contact with one another and when for whatever reason masks are not worn, distance is not kept, people who are symptomatic don’t self-isolate. “Right now we are seeing a higher incidence in Donegal than we have in other parts of the country and in that regard, it is incumbent on us as doctors to point out our concerns so that people can take proactive actions because there are many people who remain very vulnerable to this disease over the coming weeks,” he said. “All we are asking people in Donegal to do is to protect themselves and their families. We are not proposing any dferent measures for any one part of Donegal as things currently stand, and I would be hopeful and optimistic given the level of engagement over the past number of days that we wont be looking at some sort of additional measures for the county or any part of the county over the coming weeks.” He said the priority for people over the coming weeks is to meet people outside. “As far as is possible at all, do not meet up with friends or extended families or do not have parties inside. Inside gives this virus such an advantage in terms of transmission,” he said. “Last January Donegal had an incidence of , per ,. It is now  per ,. It is the highest in the country but it’s an order of magnitude lower than where it was and that’s down to the work of the majority doing most of the right things most of the time.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Eaacutebha Mullanand Ciaroacuten Mullan , from Ballerin, have written about the loss of their father Kieran Squealer Mullan in , when the siblings were just five and three years old. Ahead of a k sponsored run this weekend in aid of the Mental Health Awareness charity, Eaacutebha and Ciaroacutens mother, Collette, has shared her childrens plea to break the taboo around mens mental health. “On May  , it will be  years since Ciaroacuten and I last saw our Daddy. With cold shock, I realise that means hes been gone for  years longer than I knew him,” wrote Eaacutebha. googletag.cmd.push “We were only five and three when he took his own le. For many people, a period of time relieves much of the pain, and makes it easier to move on. “But for us, in many ways, its got worse. Losing a parent at five and three meant we didnt really understand death. I didnt even know it was suicide until I was in P. “Our Daddys death has left us with years of unsolved questions, new and fresh situations to face without a father. “Even from the day he died, we are still finding out new things about him to add to the tiny memories we thankfully have. Five years is no time to know someone well. googletag.cmd.push “I wish we could go back to those days when we were just a little boy and girl, too young to notice how down our Daddy really was. Eaacutebha has posted details of the sponsored runs route on social media. “I wish we could spread them throughout the rest of our lives knowing what people are thinking and going through, hoping we could help them in any possible way. “Why cant we swap the day he held us as a baby at our Christening, so he could watch us play Gaelic, win big matches and watch us succeed in le  “Ten years on and we are still listening to his favourite songs, watching the one existing video of him to remember his voice, crying on Fathers Day or his birthday, or any random day.     “We still cant let our Daddy go. Everyone thinks we might have moved on, because it happened such a long time ago. “But they dont know how it feels to look at the same few photographs, knowing there will never be any more. “They dont know how strange it feels to think we once had two parents. They dont know what its like to sit and talk to your Daddy at a gravestone at  and  knowing that he didnt want to be here. “If we let him go, hes gone forever, and we cant take that. The effect of suicide isnt just the loss of the person who left you behind, its the shadow always at your heel.” Eaacutebha and Ciaroacuten have shared their story in the hope it will help others to speak out about their mental health. “Ten years on, and suicide is still the leading cause of death for men under ,” said Eaacutebha. “Every day, men who feel like our Daddy did bottle up their feelings, try to appear strong, and drive themselves further into darkness. “Every day,  of them take their lives, leaving people like Ciaroacuten and I lost and heartbroken. And every day, we wish we could change what happened. “For our Daddy, the sun will never come out again, but the more we talk about it, the more we listen, the more others will live to see another day and the more the shadows will fade.”] The k sponsored run in memory of Kieran Squealer Mullan will take place on Sunday May , with all proceeds going to the Mental Health Awareness charity.

Brooke McEldowney, a Primary One pupil at St Brigids Tirkane Bunscoil Naomh Briacuted, has appeared in Three Families, which aired this week on BBC One. Three Families explores the emotive issues around womens rights and tells the story of the grassroots campaign to lt Northern Irelands restrictions on abortion. Brooke enjoying herself on set. Brooke landed the role after her mum Kirsty received an email from a casting agency. “When I opened an email about NI filming and how they were on the lookout for a young child, Brooke fitted the description,” she told Derry Now. googletag.cmd.push “It was all very overwhelming as the world was going through a pandemic and my daughter was now going to be part of a cast. It all felt like a dream.” For Brooke, the dream was very much a reality, and although she began filming at just four years of age, the young County Derry girl made light of the heavy schedule.  “She has been such a busy girl, taking everything in her stride and having so many dferent roles in filming and completely loving it all,” said Kirsty. “During the lockdowns while everyone was at home, I was arranging my other kids childcare and driving to our next destination for long days ahead. googletag.cmd.push “She had attended local drama and dance classes for a short while - pre-Covid - so this helped. She loved all the attention and getting chauffeured to each set, a few places I never expected to be.” Five-year-old Brooke has a central role in the drama as the daughter of actor Colin Morgan, previously of The Fall and actress Amy James Kelly, who has previously featured in Coronation Street. “When I met them and signed the contracts I knew that this was a big deal and how I had to keep everything a secret,” said Kirsty. “I had to travel myself to each set every couple of days prior filming to get a Covid test. Thankfully, they were all negative so Brooke could always continue with her role.”     The future is already looking bright for the Maghera girl, and she was handed a unique birthday present in February when she began filming on a CBBC musical drama series. “It was so perfect and fitting on her th birthday and the cast, producers and directors spoiled her,” said Kirsty. “Her confidence rapidly grew and has been even given spoken lines for on screen. She has gained multiple jobs since and has now been signed up by an agency.” Brooke on set with Colin Morgan and Amy James Kelly. Keeping her feet on the ground amid the excitement of her new-found fame will be an easy task with the support of her community and her school. “When ing to school after lockdown Brooke had days off due to filming but the BBC always liaised so well with the school,” said Kirsty. “Brooke is a very independent, intelligent girl and likes a good routine. She was thrilled when her teacher, Mrs Convery sent work via Seesaw and was always keen to get the tasks completed. “We are so proud and it has been an emotional journey as I have been involved in the Arts for many years and know how challenging it can be. “It’s all such an amazing experience and the opportunities it has opened for her have been remarkable. I am so privileged that we get to go on this journey together as mother and daughter. “We are bursting with pride.” Three Families is available to watch now on BBC iPlayer.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Brooke McEldowney, a Primary One pupil at St Brigids Tirkane Bunscoil Naomh Briacuted, has appeared in Three Families, which aired this week on BBC One. Three Families explores the emotive issues around womens rights and tells the story of the grassroots campaign to lt Northern Irelands restrictions on abortion. Brooke enjoying herself on set. Brooke landed the role after her mum Kirsty received an email from a casting agency. “When I opened an email about NI filming and how they were on the lookout for a young child, Brooke fitted the description,” she told Derry Now. googletag.cmd.push “It was all very overwhelming as the world was going through a pandemic and my daughter was now going to be part of a cast. It all felt like a dream.” For Brooke, the dream was very much a reality, and although she began filming at just four years of age, the young County Derry girl made light of the heavy schedule.  “She has been such a busy girl, taking everything in her stride and having so many dferent roles in filming and completely loving it all,” said Kirsty. “During the lockdowns while everyone was at home, I was arranging my other kids childcare and driving to our next destination for long days ahead. googletag.cmd.push “She had attended local drama and dance classes for a short while - pre-Covid - so this helped. She loved all the attention and getting chauffeured to each set, a few places I never expected to be.” Five-year-old Brooke has a central role in the drama as the daughter of actor Colin Morgan, previously of The Fall and actress Amy James Kelly, who has previously featured in Coronation Street. “When I met them and signed the contracts I knew that this was a big deal and how I had to keep everything a secret,” said Kirsty. “I had to travel myself to each set every couple of days prior filming to get a Covid test. Thankfully, they were all negative so Brooke could always continue with her role.”     The future is already looking bright for the Maghera girl, and she was handed a unique birthday present in February when she began filming on a CBBC musical drama series. “It was so perfect and fitting on her th birthday and the cast, producers and directors spoiled her,” said Kirsty. “Her confidence rapidly grew and has been even given spoken lines for on screen. She has gained multiple jobs since and has now been signed up by an agency.” Brooke on set with Colin Morgan and Amy James Kelly. Keeping her feet on the ground amid the excitement of her new-found fame will be an easy task with the support of her community and her school. “When ing to school after lockdown Brooke had days off due to filming but the BBC always liaised so well with the school,” said Kirsty. “Brooke is a very independent, intelligent girl and likes a good routine. She was thrilled when her teacher, Mrs Convery sent work via Seesaw and was always keen to get the tasks completed. “We are so proud and it has been an emotional journey as I have been involved in the Arts for many years and know how challenging it can be. “It’s all such an amazing experience and the opportunities it has opened for her have been remarkable. I am so privileged that we get to go on this journey together as mother and daughter. “We are bursting with pride.” Three Families is available to watch now on BBC iPlayer.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

US President Joe Biden, Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will be among those attending the UN Climate Change World Conference in Glasgow in November. Their decison-making will be influenced by the artwork of local schoolgirl, Alex Patterson, from Eglinton, and four other talented young artists. It follows the Year  student at Foyle Colleges art entry, Mother Earth, winning the prestigious UN Climate Change World Conference Creative Earth competition which had over , entries googletag.cmd.push The judging , included former Spice Girl Geri Horner and COP president, Alok Sharma. The judges said they were particularly impressed and inspired by Alex’s entry because of the way she brought the continents together to look after Mother Nature, depicting animals we need to protect and the technologies that will enable this. Geri Horner was so impressed with Alexs piece, that she will eventually get to own it and put it on display with her collection of artwork at her countryside home. Congratulting all five winners, the former Spice Girl posted on her Twitter account: “Congrats Alex, Yumna, Vedantika, Isla and Emma for winning the Creative Earth competition. Amazed and inspired by the creativity of young people from across the UK and we’re excited to showcase their artwork to the world at COP this November.” googletag.cmd.push Alexs achievement was reported worldwide at the weekend when she featured on Sky News on Saturday and on the channels FYI news slot for young people yesterday morning. On the programme, she explained the thinking behind her design. She said: “It is basically a tree but instead of branches there are seven hands and these represent the seven continents and in the hands there is Mother Nature. So, basically,everyone came together then we will be able to protect Mother Nature.” She said she was confident the world leaders would take notice of her and the other pieces of artwork.     She said: ”I think we have made it pretty clear in all of our drawings what we think is wrong and how we can make it better.” Meanwhile, Alex recently submitted three pieces to the Royal Academy of Arts in London, with hopes of selection for the Summer Show Exhibition. In May last year, Alex, a former pupil of Eglinton Primary School, raised pound, for the Western Trusts Covid- ward at Altnagelvin Hospital by completing a -hour painting marathon.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Trevor Smullen netted for Longford as Derry led - to - at the break. The game was still in its first minute when Bradley took advantage of a defensive mistake to fire the ball into the net. In injury-time Bradley netted from the penalty spot after he was fouled. The gap increased to three early in the second half before Longford hit four points without reply. David Barden wasted an excellent goal chance for Longford and Derry took advantage as Joe Diver pointed.

Minutes later, Derry sub Joe Diver scored a goal reminiscent of Joe Sheridans against Louth two previously - this time referee Michael Duffy awarded a free out and Longford were safe. Longford had led by three at the break, - to -, thanks largely to the accuracy from frees of Sean McCormack. Paddy Bradley showed all his class too in the opening phase of the game and was at the heart of anything productive from Derry. McGoldricks first goal levelled the match, finishing coolly, after being set up by Paddy Bradley. His second goal put Derry in the driving seat, despite not playing well.

Thatrsquos not the same as having a formal British Irish Intergovernmental Conference with officials and an agenda, he said.ldquoI have no objectionthey want to talk every day. Thatrsquos a good idea, but I think the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement should be followed and that means there should be a BIIC on a regular and frequent basis. That is what was signed.Speaking weeks after street violence by loyalist protesters erupted in Belfast over issues related to Brexit and the NI Protocol, Mr Ahern said BIIC meetings were very important.ldquoIt does concern me that we havenrsquot had a British Irish Intergovernmental Conference for a long, long time, maybe a few years.Mr Ahern was interviewed by former BBC political correspondent Martina Purdy and former barrister Elaine Kelly, who spoke to the former Taoiseach about peace-building, faith and St Patrick.ldquoThe two governments, the British and Irish governments are the custodians of the Agreement. They are not meeting to discuss these issues. That clearly is not in line with the agreement.ldquoI am not using any other words than what the Agreement usedhellip The agreement says that there must be frequent meetings and you know that should be happening.ldquoThey donrsquot have to be for long. They can be on zoom, Microsoft teams anything you like. They should be having these meetings and where there are dficulties they should be dealing with at those meetings.ldquoIn the absence of those meetings, things can drt. Quite frankly I donrsquot understand why those meetings canrsquot take place.ldquoI donrsquot expect the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach to have a meeting all day ndash they donrsquot have to do that. They could have a meeting for an hour and half.

So my stress levels were abnormally high.ldquoI soon felt like I couldnrsquot feed Edward enough, stress got the better of me at times and my brilliant health visitor Maura pointed me to a local breastfeeding group and also another brilliant lady, my breastfeeding peer support worker Aine Jordan-Doxey, who just completely gave me the confidence and support to keep going.ldquoThe peer breastfeeding group is hosted by a midwe health visitor and contains a beautul bunch of souls who are just there for each other. Wersquore all in the same boat and through this group I have received many tips, tricks and even friends.Despite Joannersquos determination to breastfeed Edward, it wasnrsquot all plain sailing.ldquoBreastfeeding is just the most beautul thing.Yes it can be dficult and absolutely frustrating at times but the benefits far outweigh those short blips, she said.ldquoThe best advice Irsquove ever heard mdash lsquodonrsquot give up on a bad dayrsquo.On a rough day, breastfeeding Edward gave me comfort, knowing I was the reason he is full and happy made me feel so good.ldquoAine gave me so much advice, including certain foods to eat to boost milk supply. Oats, theyrsquore your best friend! And you cannot drink enough water.Soon Joanne had more milk that Edward could take so she began collecting extra milk for the milk bank.She said: ldquoThe bottles arrived and I filled the first ml on December  last year. The donation was nearly full in a month but sadly my dad passed away on January  at the age of . There was a few weeks with no donations as my milk supply ped to an all-time low. Itrsquos just incredible what stress can do to your body.ldquoWell, Aine was there again, checking in, keeping me in chat, and keeping me motivated to keep breastfeeding. I am very lucky to have a wonderful, supportive husband, a close knit family and a close circle of best friends who have been tremendous during this very dficult time.Joanne went on to complete her donation of four litres of milk she calls ldquoliquid gold on Motherrsquos Day and wants to thank Aine for all her help and support.She said: ldquoI fully support every motherrsquos choice to either breastfeed or bottle-feed butanyone was struggling to breastfeed I would strongly recommend taking the support thatrsquos available.ldquoPersonally I am continuing to breastfeed because it gives me a little comfort in this time of grief, itrsquos a moment where I just look into his eyes and feel so needed and loved. So not only for the instantly available nutrition and comfort to my son but for those moments of joy I get from it too.Aine says she is so proud of Joanne mdash not only for continuing to breastfeed during the emotional time of her fatherrsquos illness and death but also for contributing four litres of milk to the Trustrsquos milk bank.The mother-of-threersquos own experience of breastfeeding had been rewarding but also not without its challenges.While she was living in England at the time, she recalled a time when one of her children was not thriving while she was feeding them.ldquoMy doctor and my health visitor both told me to stop breastfeeding my son and it was so frustrating as I knew that was not the problem so I continued on and it turned out that there was something  wrong.She began supporting Joanne in November last year when Edward was five weeks old.ldquoJoanne was exhausted and had been through some dficult nights where Edward wasnrsquot sleeping and was screaming through the night.I remember speaking with her about developmental leaps and what to expect at this stage and the normal infant sleep patterns, said Aine.ldquoFrom the beginning I could tell Joanne had so much passion for breastfeeding and wanted to succeed in every way. Joanne began expressing enough to give Edward a bottle and soon after he started sleeping better, just in time for her toddler to stop sleeping through. Joanne never let this stop her and carried on with minimal sleep.Aine said that when Joanne first mentioned to her about the possibility of donating milk, there were only  donors on the Northern Ireland milk bank.She said ldquoI was so proud as Joanne was the first of my mums to donate and it honestly made me smile at the thought. As usual Joanne just laughed and said it was no big deal as she enjoyed it. It was the first time I disagreed with her as I thought she was doing an extraordinary thing.ldquoWhen I opened her message and saw Edward surrounded by four litres of expressed milk for the milk bank, I was blown away again. What an incredible gt for the sick babies in theneonatal units.ldquoNot only was Joanne potty training a toddler and breastfeeding on demand, but she was expressing for the milk bank. I am so thankful to have been a part of her journey. So often there isnrsquot enough support available for mums especially with breastfeeding, and Covid made it more dficult as the usual support groups had all closed. Thatrsquos why peer support is so valuable as it provides one to one support for mums at the most important time.Aine highlighted the need for support for breastfeeding mums. ldquoWe need to be offering all mums support from the very first chance which is the case for a lot, but sometimes mums donrsquot know about us until itrsquos too late. ldquoI am thankful to Joanne for sharing this experience with me and I know we will still be in touch for a long time.ldquoAnd even though Irsquom sure she will downplay what she has achieved, I can honestly say I am so proud of her and all her hard work.Mothers can be referred to the Trustrsquos breastfeeding support worker through midwery and health visiting services..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Carlisle.jpg","title":"Carlisle’s staff in charity hike in memory of much loved Pat  ","story":"ONE hundred staff and friends at Carlislersquos in Ballynahinch are each walking five miles this week on a sponsored walk in honour of a much-loved colleague who died last month.Pat Greene, who was from Saintfield, died on April , much to the shock and sorrow of everyone at the business.The  year-old had worked for Carlislersquos for  years, starting off as a coal boy, going on to work in all areas of the business and finishing as a work supervisor.Donna Carlisle explained that Pat loved The Proclaimers song Irsquom Gonna Beand it inspired the charity effort from staff members, past and present, and their partners.ldquoIt was Patrsquos favourite song and it had to be on the playlist at all our party nights when we raised money for ious cancer charities.

However, he did not make it through to show his impressive main course and dessert to the judges.Both chefs threw their all into devising four courses, including an appetiser and pre-dessert mdash based on the theme celebrating British innovation.Hopes were high for East Down given that Dundrum chef Alex Browne Greene, from EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, got two dishes to the national final last year and narrowly missed out on being crowned champion of champions at the banquet.Gemmarsquos starter was a twist on gammon, egg and chips, inspired by Kegomatic from Queenrsquos University students and for her fish course, the innovation shown in the building of the Titanic inspired her sea bass fish dish.She used William Clannyrsquos invention of the safety lamp for miners for her main course of lamb and the influence of astronomer Alice Everett as the first woman to work for the Royal Observatory to inspire her dessert, Out of this World.The dessert was her favourite course and she was delighted to have been scored a ten by chef Daniel Clford.ldquoIrsquom known for my desserts so I was really delighted to have got that score from Daniel, said Gemma.ldquoI also took his advice on my main course as therersquos no better person to take advice from and generally scaled back my dishes and made them more refined as the comments back were that there was too much on the plate.While Gemma was proud to have made it through to the regional final, she said she was not disappointed at not going through to the national judging.ldquoTo be honest, it was a bit of a relief as I did not know how I was going to go up against all the other chefs in the national final as I have only been cheffing for seven years and am mostly self-taught, she revealed.Gemma went into the competition, which was filmed last November, full of confidence and determined to do her best.ldquoI think I just went into a zone and concentrated on my own dishes and not to get too caught up in what the other chefs were doing, she said.ldquoPhelim was brilliant on the day and deserved to win and I remember saying on the programme that the better chef won. I hope that he goes on to get a dish to the banquet.While she has been receiving fantastic customer feedback from her popup, A Peculiar Tea, which she has been operating during the lockdowns, Gemma admitted that cooking was not her first career choice.ldquoWhen I left school I actually went to Queenrsquos University to do a nursing degree but a medical issue I experienced meant that I couldnrsquot complete it, she said.She then studied Bio Medical Sciences for a while before going to Ulster University to complete a software engineering degree.Her love of food and cooking mdash inspired by her chef mother mdash was strictly a hobby until the age of  when she took her first job at Slims Kitchen on the Lisburn Road in Belfast where she cut her teeth for a year while doing a Culinary Masters course.For four years Gemma continued studying and working full-time at a iety of great establishments, such as the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast where she rose to head pastry chef, before moving The Old Inn, Crawfordsburn, where she worked all the sections and eventually became sous chef.She has been in Alexanders for the last two years and got the opportunity to become an owner last year.ldquoIt may have taken my several attempts before I found the right career but I was determined not to do any job that I did not absolutely love and was passionate about.Like Gemma, Brunels chef Paul Cunningham hopes to be invited back next year after his disappointing showing this year.The  year-old had hoped to get to the regional judging to please his six-year-old daughter, Farrah.ldquoFarrah and I are massive fans of the show, we watch every year and of course, I wanted to further than I did but Irsquove got over the disappointment now and concentrating on getting the restaurant ready for re-opening, Paul told the Recorder.Paul is known for only using local produce from within a -mile radius of Newcastle and foraging for herbs and plants.His menu reflected his locality and passion for pioneers including Belfast-born Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Isambard Kingdom Brunelrsquos refloating of the SS Great Britain in Dundrum Bay mdash an incident which led him to name his restaurant by the great engineer.Paul only got to cook his starter and main course on the show but said his main course and dessert were showstoppers, with the main course of lamb called Healthy Heart made without using any salt or butter, inspired by Frank Pantridge who invited the portable defibrillator.He also collaborated with Doran Precision Engineering to create a model of the Titanic for one of his dishes and a special dish to show off his dessert, the Atom Smasher, inspired by Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Condemnation.jpg","title":"Condemnation over Murlough vandalism  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have criticised vandals responsible for setting fire to a gate at the Murlough Nature Reserve two weekends ago as  firefighters were battling a huge blaze in the nearby Mournes.The vandals also left behind a trail of rubbish at the internationally acclaimed area with their actions condemned by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.They say it ldquobeggars belief that while the raging wildfire destroyed  acres of rich habitat across the Mournes, there were people who thought that it was appropriate to start a fire at the Nature Reserve.The politicians also revealed that National Trust staff had to remove  bags of rubbish from the Reserve location on the Sunday the fire in the Mournes was eventually extinguished.Cllr Devlin said as young people drank alcohol and watched the blaze raging across the mountains, they set fire to a pedestrian gate which is also used to prevent Exmore ponies at the Reserve from escaping.ldquoI am really shocked at this behaviour, she said. ldquoBy the Saturday evening, everyone in the locality had an idea of the widespread damage in the Mournes but these iniduals thought it appropriate to cause more damage and potentially risk another blaze.ldquoI have no idea who these iniduals were and how old they are so I am appealing to people young and old.

Since them, it has been reviewing the situation on a monthly basis and confirmed this week that cover remains in place for this month.The news has been welcomed by South Down MP Eddie McGrady, who said the Trust has also confirmed that it has been in contact with Belfast-based anaesthetists to ascertain their long-term commitment to the provision of services at the Downe Hospital and maternity unit.ARDGLASS ndash The crisis facing the fishing industry is to top the agenda at a special meeting hosted by the Provincersquos Agriculture Minister.The talks with Brid Rodgers are expected to take place at her Dundonald Houses headquarters within the next few weeks and involve politicians from Down, Ards and Newry and Mourne councils.Representatives for each of the three areas have already joined forces to draw up a plan to help beleaguered fishermen based in Ardglass, Portavogie and Kilkkeel and have been seeking a meeting with the Minister for some time to discuss the detail of a new strategy they have put together.Miss Rodgers was unable to make space in her diary because of her heavy involvement with the foot and mouth crisis, but she has now confirmed the talks with the local politicians will take place shortly.ANNACLOY ndash A local councillor has welcomed progress on the improvement scheme for the Annacloy Road, outside Downpatrick, and has called on the Roads Service to carry out the work ldquoas a matter of urgency.Cllr Margaret Ritchie said she has for some time been campaigning to have the section of the Annacloy Road from the Kingrsquos Bridge to the Belfast Road ldquosubstantially improved.Describing the road as ldquovery narrow and undulating, Miss Ritchie said that after discussions with Roads Service officials, she was pleased when they informed her last November that the road had been placed on an improvement programme..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Hopes.jpg","title":"Hopes Dunleath Park can be hub for cyclists  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK councillor Gareth Sharvin has welcomed plans to establish a cycle hub at Down Leisure Centre and Dunleath Park in partnership with Cycling Ireland.Two -foot containers will be used ndash one for hosting courses and tutoring, and the other to be used for bike storage, maintenance and a workshop facility.Last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee approved the scheme, which Cllr Sharvin described as a welcome addition for Dunleath Park and Downpatrick.ldquoThis is the second project item to be planned for Dunleath Park following the SDLPrsquos motion to council calling for the development of sporting and recreational activities at the site, he said.The new cycling hub will compliment and utilise the planned build of a recreational path around the perimeter of Dunleath Park.The cycle hub is part of a new initiative by Cycling Ireland who are working in partnership with local authorities to establish similar facilities across Northern Ireland.Councillor Sharvin added: ldquoThis will be a great addition to the area of Downpatrick and the district.

He had a rare gt for making everyone feel better about themselves and for knowing they always had a friend in him. Facebook notices of his death drew an unprecedented outpouring of tributes and comments from across the region and demonstrated the levels of affection in which Jim was held.As a footballer he had few peers. His time with Downpatrick Rec was marked with cup and league successes, culminating in lting the Steel and Sons Cup in front of record attendances at the Crusaders Seaview ground for the first drawn match and the subsequent replay.Supporters from Downpatrick travelled in their thousands, marking the event one of the most widely celebrated sporting achievements of that era. The gate receipts were the highest ever recorded for the annual showpiece of amateur soccer in Northern Ireland, so much so that for the first time the income exceeded the VAT threshold, which meant tax had to be paid.On the day the Rec won that Steel Cup replay, Distillery tried to sign Jim as he left the pitch. He turned them down with a typically firm but gentlemanly refusal and stayed with the Rec for another four years, helping them to add to their cabinet of silverware.Jim lsquoCootrsquo Connolly was a player of exceptional talent. A classy and cultured defender, he is remembered for his unique ability to rise above other players, most of whom had a distinct height advantage, but lacked Jimrsquos trademark for timing his runs and hanging in the air for longer than ought to have been humanly possible. Many a spectator were left speechless after matches, shaking their heads in puzzlement at his exploits. Yes, he was that good.Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran, who was the Downpatrick Rec goalkeeper, said it was ldquosometimes scary playing behind Jim. ldquoWhen I walked with Coot or talked with him or more often had a beer with him, I felt I was in the presence of greatness.So much so that everyone wanted a part of that, and his we Angie and family had to learn to share Coot because he just made you feel good about yourself. For that we as a community are eternally grateful to them. His footballing ability was absolutely extraordinary. I played behind him and said to him on a few occasions lsquoCoot you scare me. The things you do defy the laws of physics and gravityrsquo. He would jump for a ball start to come down and without touching the ground go up again. I swear it.Tony added: ldquoThe world is a sadder place for his leaving but somewhere up there hersquoll be playing with the guys that have gone before him and maybe BFwill be managing. I hope they will keep me a place on their team.Former Rec manager Jim Prior was devastated to learn of Jimrsquos death. ldquoLike all his former teammates I am cut to ribbons that Jim is no longer with us. As a footballer, he was simply out of this world. The other players on our most successful team were in awe of Jim and all loved him. He had star quality written all over him.He could do things that others couldnrsquot do, whether that was on the training ground or in the toughest of matches. I canrsquot remember him putting in less than a five-star performance.The Recrsquos former club secretary, Patricia Murrayremembers Jim as the baby of the Steel Cup team. ldquoMy deepest and heartfelt sympathies to Angela and all his family and friends. His laugh, smile and craic will be truly missed, Patricia said.Jim Connollyrsquos impact with Downpatrick was repeated at his next clubs, Ards and Killyleagh YC, where he suffered a career ending injury. He had been with the club for just two seasons but left an indelible mark. One of Killyleaghrsquos stalwart players, Philip Jennings, posted his own tribute. ldquoGreat memories of watching Jim for the great Down Rec team and playing with him at Ards and Killyleagh. A real legend in local football, but even more than that, just an absolute gentleman.Despite his injury, Jim ed to football several years later to turn out for the Downshire Hospital, with whom he won an all-Ireland medal winner in  under the management of Brian Cheetham.But the question always remained about what could have become of this precocious talent had he been able to stick with one of English footballrsquos premier clubs.His trials there were cut short by homesickness, more particularly an abiding love for his recently widowed mother. Downpatrick was his anchor. Family, friends, and the Stream Street precinct of his youth were too deeply ingrained for the young Connolly to ever contemplate leaving them behind. It was never a regret for Jim. Indeed,anything, the choice to stay reinforced his passion and love for the area. He perhaps never knew how deeply those feelings of connection were ed by those who had the good fortune to know him.Jimrsquos trials were at Nottingham Forest, Newcastle, and Everton, all three organised by local scout Bill Oakes. Everton came closest to getting his signature after pursuing him back to Downpatrick, although it was later learned that Newcastle too badly wanted to bring him on board.Local sports writer Charlie McStay recalled being contacted in later years by one of the Newcastle coaches who was enquiring about what had happened to Jim. ldquoNewcastle knew they had a gem on their hands, but he slipped through the net.All the coaches rated him at the highest level and believed he would have gone on to become a true star of English football, said Charlie.What a journey that would have been. All the way from Dunleath City and Santos in the Downpatrick Youth League to the pinnacle of professional soccer.Although soccer was Jimrsquos first love, he was an accomplished boxer and in his early days was trained by Owen Kerr, a respected coach who was a friend of world heavyweight champion, Floyd Patterson. Coincidentally, Owen was uncle to Cathal Kerr, who married Jimrsquos sister Bronagh. Small world!Jim also played juvenile and senior football for the Downpatrick Russell Gaelic Union, which this week remembered him as ldquomore than just a great footballer.An online RGU statement said: ldquoHe was one of the nicest guys you could ever meet. A true gentleman with an infectious laugh, he will be sadly missed by all who knew him.Away from sport, Jim trained as a mechanic and later became a minibus driver at Knockevin School and the local hospitals. He then joined Ulsterbus as a driver at the Downpatrick depot and rounded off his career as a groundsman at the Delamont estate. Always active, alwaysbusy that was the Jim Connolly way.Throughout his le, Jimrsquos singular passion was his family and friends. He was devoted to his we Angela mdash the couple were together from their teenage days and were rarely seen apart mdash and to his children, Aurla, Blaine and Clare. Nothing brought him greater happiness also than the birth of his grandchildren, Ruby, Darcy, Fianna, Fiachra, Grace and Eve. He is also survived by brothers Pat and Martin, sisters Ann, Marie, Bronagh, and Eilish, by his father-in-law Paddy Teggart, and by sons-in-law Feargal and Jude and his daughter-in-law Megan.Theirs is not a private grief. It is shared by countless hundreds who remember the boy and man who gave so much pleasure and for whom there is always a place in their hearts.Joe McCoubrey.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Job.jpg","title":"JobStart scheme to help young people welcomed by MLA  ","story":"THE launch of a new government scheme designed to create job opportunities for young people has been welcomed by local politicians.Department for Communities minister Deirdre Hargey last week launched the poundm JobStart scheme designed to support - year olds facing additional employment challenges due to the impact of Covid-.In addition, the government department has also helped create additional employment opportunities for young people and remove barriers for those seeking employment through the work experience programme and an expanded adviser discretionary fund.Minister Hargey said the Covid- pandemic has had an ldquounprecedented impact on the local economy and labour market and that as part of her departmentrsquos response, it has addressed the anticipated impacts on young people and those who are ready to be re-employed but need help negotiating the process of finding work.ldquoThis has included creating job opportunities and placements for young people providing additional payments towards travel or childcare expenses financial support of up to pound, a year to assist in the removal of barriers to employment and training to help people increase their chances of gaining employment.The JobStart scheme is designed to create opportunities for - year olds by providing positions with employers for a period of six months, increasing to nine months for those who meet additional criteria.An Opportunity Guarantee strand has been added to The Work Experience Programmefeaturing  week placements with the guarantee of an interview for a job or an apprenticeship on completion.Strangford MLA Kellie Armstrong and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran have both welcomed the new scheme.Mrs Armstrong said the scheme was originally due to start last year, arguing that many young people may have missed out as a result of its delayed implementation.She continued: ldquoThe roll-out of this scheme is welcome as it will help young people climb back from the pandemic financially, while giving the economy a boost. I encourage them to apply for it.ldquoHowever, it is frustrating it has taken us so long to get to this stage. The rest of the UK benefited from it [the scheme] while Northern Ireland lagged behind which was unacceptable. Something which would be so useful can only lose value as time moves on.The MLA said that during the height of lockdown, people under  were the most impacted in terms of job losses and went from ldquoexpecting a scheme to wonderingone would appear at all, confirming that she has asked for confirmation that the Department for Communities will ensure opportunities from the JobStart scheme will be made available across Northern Ireland and will not just be concentrated around Belfast.Cllr Curran said with lockdown restrictions continuing to ease, any move to create job opportunities for young people is particularly welcome as they have a key role to play in future economic success.ldquoMany young people have bore the brunt of an unparalleled economic situation which has had a massive impact on the provincersquos economy, he continued.ldquoRebuilding the economy will require access to highly skilled and talented young iniduals to enable employers to compete globally and young people, in particular, need to be able to avail of high quality routes into careers.Cllr Curran also highlighted the importance of apprenticeship schemes to assist with economic recovery, and, looking forward, believes it is vital that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has access to highly skilled employers as businesses work to recover from the devastating impact of coronavirus.He said he firmly believes that the enterprise, innovation and entrepreneurship of young people is crucial to the economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Athletics.jpg","title":"Lady luck for East Down AC runners  ","story":"THE  Belfast Half Marathon was always going to be a virtual affair due to Covid- restrictions, but that didnrsquot seem to put people off entering and setting their own route in order to chase a personal best for the distance or simply to claim their T-shirt.This event is normally well attended and attracts a raft of spectators, which creates a great atmosphere, but this year it was up to the runners to come up with a way of motivating themselves on the day.East Down AC had several runners who have used this as their incentive to keep churning out the long runs and as the date approached they were well prepared to cover the . miles.It was a case of girl power as all the EDAC athletes who took part were female on this occasion. Joanne Carson is credited with coming up with a pleasing route for her buddies, Helen Vint, Mags Flynn and Cathy Burke.These girls are to be seen most weekends, rain, hail or shine, chalking up miles in and around Downpatrick. Their dedication is most commendable. In their opinion, a half marathon is long enough to challenge the legs but not as draining as a full marathon so you could almost say that it is an enjoyable task.Joanne got them off to a familiar start. They met outside Castlewellan Forest Park on Saturday morning and ran into the park to do three laps of the lake. Nicely warmed up, they then headed out the main road to Newcastle and didnrsquot stop till they were in the grounds of the Slieve Donard hotel.They fairly breezed along and were all within sight of each other as they came to a halt. Cathy andMags were at the head of the pack in one hour  minutes with Helen less than a minute behind.Joanne was just a few seconds over the two hours and more than happy with her run and they all agreed that it was a scenic route.Being at the Percy French and the fact that outside hospitality had conveniently opened the night before, it would have been rude not to have an ice cold beverage to celebrate. Well deserved ladies.And so to Sunday, Suzy Smith often meets with friends and family including Kelly her niece for a long Sunday run.They stay close to home in Ballykinlar where the terrain could be described as lumpy. In fact whichever way they go, there are some challenging hills but these girls are well used to it and tough enough to persevere.Suzy had actually only planned to run a few miles with brother Patrick to encourage him on his way to the half marathon distance but she was enjoying it so much that she ran on and on until before she knew it, she had covered the entire . miles.Despite this only being her second time to complete a half marathon, she finished in a very respectable time of two hours and five minutes.Who knows how well she could doshe was participating in an official race Kelly meanwhile had struck a brisk pace from the off and followed her own rhythm easing ahead in the early stages. She has been running very well in training and it was no surprise that despite the gradients involved, she ended up with a personal best time of one hour  minutes.Again there is no doubt on a flatter course with other runners to chase, there will be improvement to come but for now both Smiths were content with their efforts and so they should be, well done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7May2021-Leader.jpg","title":"Leader and inspiration  ","story":"FINNEBROGUE Artisan has promised to continue the legacy of founding chairman Denis Lynn who died in a quad bike accident at the weekend.Hailed as an ldquoinnovator and visionary, Mr Lynn died following a tragic incident at his home in Killyleagh on Sunday.Mr Lynnbecame synonymous with his Downpatrick-based firm, which now employs , people over four local sites.On buying Finnebrogue Estate on the outskirts of the town in , the former potato chip seller turned to beef and deer farming and established Finnebrogue as the biggest venison processor and supplier in the UK.He then produced quality sausages, supplying Marks and Spencer and other leading retailers, and developed the nitrate-free bacon brand, Naked Bacon, in .More recently, Finnebrogue has ersied into developing meat-free products.The firmrsquos senior management team will now lead the business with non-executive director David Manning stepping up as interim-chairman and non-executive director Colin Walsh as interim deputy-chairman.A company statement paid tribute to Mr Lynn, who is survived by his we Christine, daughters Kerry, Clare, Tara and Ciara, and his wider family circle.It said: ldquoDenis was an innovator and a visionary with an infectious passion for delivering positive change for the planet and its people.

Disposable barbecues are bad for the environment in terms of use and disposal, said the resident.ldquoThese barbecues are made using unsustainable materials from tropical forests in South Africa and South America.ldquoThey canrsquot be recycled, burn grass and typically result in scattered litter. Just like Chinese sky lanterns which the local council previously took action on and which were also once acceptable, the time has come to ban disposable barbecues.The resident said disposable barbecues represent a ldquohuge fire risk, burn the ground underneath them, are often left as litter and contain sharp pieces that can harm animalstrodden on.She added: ldquoThey are used in beauty spots, wildle reserves and on beaches and are just left smouldering.

This is what led to a conversation with Cathy, who had a shared love and passion for the sport, she continued.ldquoWe both agreed it would be amazingwe could bring young girls together to play camogie. The success of St. Kevinrsquos would not have been possible without the drive from both parishes.The newly formed committee is made up of a number of associated members from both clubs, who all share the same common goal of teaching camogie to as many girls as possible whilst ensuring a longevity to develop and establish the club.Cathy said it was ldquoan absolute honour to play a part in the creation of St Kevinrsquos.ldquoAs a Drumaness Gael I know that a very special lady, Annie Gelston, a Drumaness camogie legend, will be looking down with pride, said Mason.ldquoI would like to say a special word of thanks to the Drumaness and Teconnaught clubs for their unwavering support over the past few weeks, not only in the initial set-up but also with use of their pitches and facilities.The club held their first training session together at the Teconnaught club grounds on Saturday and it was evident that there is a potential successful future ahead based on the turnout of participants.ldquoTherersquos not many times in my le Irsquove been lost for words, but describing my emotions and feelings of Saturday is definitely one of them, said Maria.ldquoWe had over  girls show up for our first training session, over  in our senior ladies and U- session and over  in our sessions for the younger girls, she added.Cathy also reflected on the historic first training session, describing it as a ldquospecial moment as she watched the ldquomany smiles on the faces of the young children having fun and hopefully falling in love with the wonderful sport of camogie.Since many of the girls in all of the age groups had never attended a camogie training session before, the highly experienced coaches, who have backgrounds in both hurling and camogie, began teaching the basics to get them familiar with holding a hurley and making contact with the sliotar.Several dferent training drills were also incorporated to get the new recruits comfortable on the pitch.ldquoIt is very important to me and the coaches that we made this past Saturday and all future sessions a positive experience for the girls, said Maria.ldquoSo many of them took to it so naturally and we canrsquot wait to see how they progress over the season.St Kevinrsquos now eagerly look ahead to their first match against Ballela on May ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12600525.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Why I know some backbenchers believe there will be row back on the rollover which brought Stormont back when the DUP accepted Sinn Fein’s terms in the New Decade New Approachdeal. I expect they will be disappointed.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Recalling that Mr Poots was the prime defender of the aborted deal in February  built on conceding Irish language legislation, his stance on this issue is at best opaque. Nor is it clear where Mr Donaldson’s flexible compass now points.TUV is very clear as to why no unionist should be legislating for Irish language promotion: It is critical to be alert to the political purpose of Irish language legislation. The IRA SF newspaper An Phoblacht set it out very clearly in its edition of December   under the heading ‘Irish is central to republican struggle’ – “We believe that in the new dispensation, a rejuvenated and determined Republican Movement can utilise the language to such an extent that it can characterise our struggle in the new millennium.” Whether legislation promoting Irish is free standing or part of a trilogy of language legislation is largely a distraction. What matters is the statutory content.The starting point in the bill attached to NDNA is that official recognition will be given to the status of the Irish language. Official recognition of the status of Irish will be enforced through an Irish Language Commissioner with statutory powers to “promote and facilitate” the use of Irish throughout the public sector. This zealot will set standards that every public body must meet in the use of Irish in the delivery of its services. Such will bring obvious recruitment advantage to Irish speakers across the public service. If public bodies are required to promote and deliver their services in Irish, then, clearly staff fluent in the language will be required and preferred. The enforcer, with statutory authority, will require executive departments and all public bodies to promote and deliver services “through the medium of Irish”. So, take, by way of example, the Department of Infrastructure, which delivers directional signage on our roads.Will such then be delivered through the medium of Irish  And,not, won’t some publicly funded legal challenge insist on such, because a right has been established to have the delivery of services through Irish. I fear so.The pattern of language legislation in Wales and Scotland is of a progressive tightening of the noose. It will be no dferent here because the standards required to be met by public bodies will be reviewed every  years, providing fresh opportunities for escalating Sinn Fein demands.The figleaf of an Ulster Scots Act is a nonsense. It is not wanted or needed. Incidentally, what is on offer is the poorest of relations because unlike the Irish Language Commissioner the Ulster Scots Commissioner would have no powers to set standards that must be met.With over £m spent feting the Irish language in recent years, there is no conceivable basis on which to warrant further endless squander on Irish for the sake of paying the Sinn Fein ransom to get a failed Stormont back. And, of course, the Stormont would be a trilingual farce where every word spoken in English would be printed and translated into Irish and Ulster Scots and vice versa, even though every MLA speaks English. What an expensive farce!Thus TUV is resolute in rejecting Irish language legislation.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area.

There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I fear this is a missed opportunity to drive our economy forward and to create new jobs,” he said.“Our businesses have come through a marathon over the last year due to the pandemic. They have shown resilience and fortitude.“Policy-makers at the Department need to rethink their decision to better support local businesses.”Responding to these comments, a spokesperson for the Department for Communities acknowledged there is a desire from “some quarters” to see the transfer of these powers but added “it would not be possible to complete the passage of such legislation in the current mandate”.“For now the Department is working closely with councils in the delivery of regeneration programmes and this collaboration is working well at present,” said the spokesperson.“Local Government already plays a signicant role in ensuring the successful implementation of the Department’s regeneration programmes.“A key feature of all this work is the level of collaborative working that already exists between councils and the Department.“The relationship has been strengthened further in our joint response to COVID- where the Department collaborated with councils and other stakeholders to develop locally designed recovery plans funded through the COVID- Recovery Revitalisation Programme.”Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
