from Cork to Limerick, or whether sections may be Type 1 Dual Carriageway.The route for the new €1 billion-plus Cork-Limerick road has been announced.It will see Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) use 30-40 per cent of the existing route as it closely follows a corridor previously identified in 2011 before it was shelved due to a cutback in government programmes.The route announced on Wednesday by TII will see the proposed new road follow the route of the existing N20 from Blarney north to Rathduff before departing from the existing route and taking a line east of Mallow with a new crossing of the Blackwater, downstream of the town.The new route will involve further land acquisition north of Mallow as it travel east of Newtwopothouse and Buttevant before crossing the existing N20, north of Buttevant and continuing west of Charleville, Bruree and Banogue to link up with the existing M20 at Patrickswell.A decision has yet to be taken on whether the new route will motorway all the way from Cork to Limerick with a speed limit of 120kmh or whether sections may be Type 1 Dual Carriageway which is broadly similar to motorway but has a 100kmh speed limit.In all, the plan will involve the creation of just over 80km of new road from Blarney to Attyflynn in Co Limerick which will reduce travel times between Cork and Limerick by 20 minutes and is predicted will save approximately 60 lives over the next 30 years.The project also examined a range of rail-based options and has recommended the development of a “no change” additional hourly rail service between the two cities, via Limerick Junction, reducing intercity rail journey times by over 20 minutes between Cork and Limerick.At least 62 people have lost their lives on the Cork-Limerick Road since 1997 and last year TII published an analysis which found that road traffic collisions on the route were four times more likely to be fatal than on the average road in the country.The TII analysis found that where nationally fatal road traffic collisions account for 2 per cent of all collisions in which personal injuries are recorded, the fatality rate for equivalent collisions on the N20 in which personal injuries are recorded, was 8 per cent.The TII analysis found that of the 87 collisions recorded on the N20 between 2016 and 2018, some seven of these involved the death of a road user and a further 13 collisions led to serious injuries while the remaining 67 resulted in minor injuries to road users.Access pointsJari Howard, M20 Project Co-ordinator with Limerick City and County Council, which is the lead authority on the project, said at the time that the TII analysis also noted the high number of access points on the road, comprising 216 entrances to fields, 295 to houses and 114 to public roads.“There are a total of 625 access points on to N20 or seven per kilometre which is quite high compared to other national roads so you have a lot of traffic exiting off and entering on to the road and that can be problematic particularly for anyone turning right and crossing a lane of traffic.“It’s also a classic example of a legacy road with different cross sections so you have sections of motorway, dual carriageway with hard shoulder, single carriageway and you’re going through towns and villages so it’s changing a lot which is a particular challenge for anyone driving it the first time.“You also have a situation where 42 per cent of the road has no hard shoulder or verge so there’s nowhere to go if you need to try and take evasive action and you have a couple of really nasty spots on it like the Ballybeg bends outside Buttevant which have been the scene of several fatalities.“And you also have a high volume of traffic on it with many doing high speeds but then you also have a lot of slow moving vehicles like tractors and agricultural machinery as well as a lot of HGV so you get people trying to overtake so there are several factors making it dangerous.”Further

who got ‘goosebumps’ when she learned that a ‘Harriet’s’ shop featured in the filmA derelict patch of wasteland in one of Northern Ireland’s most socially deprived areas is now at the centre of an Oscar-winning film, and residents credit Kenneth Branagh for bringing “a wee bit of joy” to north Belfast.In the immediate aftermath of the director receiving the best original screenplay award for his semi-autobiographical movie, Belfast, the site of his childhood home at 96 Mountcollyer Street has taken on new significance.The street is just off the Limestone Road close to Tigers Bay, the small loyalist area that dominated headlines last summer over a controversial bonfire at an interface flashpoint that two Stormont ministers attempted to remove through the courts. They failed.Tattered paramilitary flags fly from lamp posts, and loyalist murals are painted on gable walls in streets blighted by decades of sectarian violence, unemployment and social problems.But on an unseasonably hot March day, neighbours and business owners are happy to talk about their pride in Branagh and the “lift” the film’s success has given them during a cost-of-living crisis and political instability.Florist Lesley-Ann Brown is pulling down the shutters early on her York Road shop after a busy weekend of Mother’s Day trading but reopens to share the story of her family’s connection to the Oscar winner.“As a child, Kenneth would have been in and out of the shop all the time picking up groceries. When he wrote his autobiography, he mentioned Harriet and referred to the shop as being the ‘source of local knowledge’.“She thought it was amazing but I had to tell her that meant there was a lot of gossip in it – which she loved. She always followed his career.”Different lightBrown, whose grandmother died 15 years ago, got “goosebumps” when she learned that a ‘Harriet’s’ shop featured in the film.“My friend saw a trailer before it came out and told me. My sister and I went to see it the first night it opened and were taken back that he’d made the connection. Harry, as we called my gran, would have been thrilled. It was poignant.“People in the community are talking about the Oscar, I had a customer phone me today to congratulate me – and I had to tell her I didn’t know Kenneth Branagh. But it’s so good because it shows Belfast in a different light and how far we’ve come. We’ve turned a corner after the dark days.”David Long (57), who grew up two doors away from Branagh in the original Victorian terraces that were demolished, says locals hope to get involved in a post-Oscar street party to celebrate.Long now lives at the end of a row of newbuild social houses facing the derelict site and is enjoying the international media interest. The Mountcollyer Street sign is attached to the outer wall of his home.“I didn’t know Kenneth but there’s a real sense of pride that our street is a part of this film. There’s talk of us getting together to do something and have some sort of street party but we don’t know who to approach,” he says.Accepting the Oscar – his first after eight nominations – Branagh paid tribute to an “amazing city and a fantastic people”.“This story is a search for joy and hope in the face of violence and loss,” he said.For former North Queen’s Street resident Elizabeth Hill (72), who knew him as a child and “hasn’t gone to the cinema in years”, she “made sure” she went to see the film with her daughter.“Kenneth would have lived down the hill from me in Mountcollyer.

I have not seen the sort of pragmatism and flexibility that would allow us to agree a deal.’  Photograph: James ManningPA Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis has played down the prospect of triggering article 16 and acknowledged Britain is legally obliged to carry out checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. He told the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster the checks demanded by the Northern Ireland protocol are “legal requirements” and it was right they were continuing despite threats by DUP Ministers to halt them. “Of course, even taking those away doesn’t necessarily in and of itself even solve some of the issues that businesses are having,” he said. He said the reason Britain did not trigger article 16 was because the government was committed to reaching an agreement with the European Commission, adding that “Article 16 doesn’t scrap the protocol.” Mr Lewis is not directly involved in the protocol negotiations which are led by foreign secretary Liz Truss and European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic. He said he believed Mr Sefcovic was eager to reach a deal but that he was hamstrung by negotiating red lines set out by EU leaders. “I think he is someone who is pragmatic, he would like to try to find a way through this. But he is trying to work within a mandate and I think there is a real issue that the mandate from his point of view may not give him the flexibility to find a way through this so far,” he said. ‘Pragmatism and flexibility’“I have not seen the sort of flexibility from the EU that I would have expected to see. I have not seen the sort of pragmatism and flexibility that would allow us to agree a deal. Otherwise we would have agreed one by now.” Describing the protocol as unsustainable, Mr Lewis said it was not working for business and 200 companies in Great Britain were no longer shipping goods to Northern Ireland. The committee’s chairman, Simon Hoare, pointed out that trade from Great Britain to Northern Ireland had increased since the protocol came into force. Mr Lewis defended his government’s decision to renege on the protocol it had itself negotiated, which he said was undermining the Belfast Agreement. Trade declineIn a separate committee hearing at Westminster on Monday, chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak admitted Brexit was causing problems for British businesses which trade with Europe. The Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR), an independent fiscal watchdog, said last week that trade as a share of the economy had fallen in Britain by 2½ times more than any other major industrialised country. “It was always inevitable that there would be a change in our trade intensity with Europe as a result of the change in trading relationship,” Mr Sunak said. “Without a doubt we are changing out trading relationship with the EU and that means a different set of controls and things that people will have to do. Obviously that will have an impact and I’m sure that’s a big part of the reason this is happening. It may just be a bit early to be definitive about which bits are doing what.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dublin airport accused of race to the bottom on conditions for security staff","story":"Dublin Airport operator DAA has been accused of a “race to the bottom” due to the working conditions on offer to security staff it is seeking to hire to help cut delays.In recent days Dublin Airport has been plagued by passenger delays caused by long queues being blamed on a lack of staff to carry out security checks.The Dáil heard on Tuesday that security staff were among those offered 1,000 redundancies during the Covid-19 pandemic and just 100 people had been rehired. Social Democrats TD Cian O’Callaghan raised the issue of the “huge queues” with Taoiseach Micheál Martin on Wednesday. He said the DAA has been advertising to hire more security staff who must be available 40 hours-per-week but are only being guaranteed 20-hours work with a minimum weekly salary of €283.Mr O’Callaghan said: “The DAA is clearly engaging in a race to the bottom driving down working conditions. This impacting directly on passengers using the airport.”He asked Mr Martin if he stands over what he described as “exploitative terms and conditions for full-time jobs in an Irish semi-State company”.Mr Martin said the DAA is working “extremely hard” to try and deal with the delays and they are recruiting staff. He said the 100 staff hired recently “should assist in the alleviation of the excessive queue times over the coming period.”On the terms being offered to staff he said: “The DAA works with social partners and through the various... employeremployee mechanisms in terms of work conditions and so on. “I’ll certainly raise the issues that you’ve raised with them.”People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett said the terms and conditions were an “absolute insult” and he said that more broadly private security staff in a number of sectors in Ireland are “shockingly badly paid”. He asked what the Government intended to do about it.Mr Martin again said he would raise the issue with the DAA and staff having to be available for 40 hours-a-week for as little as 20 hours work. The Taoiseach said: “There clearly should be a more worker-friendly approach than that. But I’ll follow up.”DAAAsked about the conditions on RTE Radio, DAA chief executive, Dalton Philips said the entry level for security staff was 35 per cent above the national minimum wage and it was pensionable with security of employment and other benefits. He said all staff were being asked to do as many hours as possible at the moment. He said there were many peaks and troughs between weekend and summer and it was a heavily seasonal sectorMr Philips said the airport was “recruiting aggressively” for security staff. “We need to recruit nearly 300 people. It is a very difficult market and this is a very skilled job. We have exacting standards which we can’t compromise in any shape, form or manner. We have always been a very strong employer over the years. ““On top of the fact that once you have recruited them there is new pan-European legislation for all airports that means you have to have an enhanced background check for all employees at an airport. It is essentially like Garda vetting plus plus. It is very vigorous and that created a lot of challenge at the beginning of the year. Speaking about the security delays he said: “There is just very significant pent up demand and much higher than we or other industry analysts had expected. We always thought it was going to return strongly but you are talking about 30 percent higher than our forecasted numbers. “To put that in context 15,000 extra passengers per day. And so we are grappling to deal with this very high demand at a time when the labour market is incredibly tight.“And finally Covid is still out there and it is a real issue. So a perfect storm. Look we apologise unreservedly. It is not what passengers should expect in Dublin Airport. And we are not happy with the situation. DAA has attributed the weekend queues to staff shortages following the collapse of international travel during the pandemic.The DAA “apologised unreservedly” to passengers who missed their flights as a result of the queues. But it warned that waiting times are likely to continue for days and weeks ahead.On Tuesday the airport announced it is pausing the sale of fast-track passes “for the time being”.A spokesman for the DAA said they are doing “everything in our power” to ensure security operations are operating “at the maximum level possible at all times” and to ensure “no further passengers have an experience at Dublin Airport like last weekend”.Other actions being taken include the redeployment of staff from other areas of the business, establishment of a senior management task force and the continual review of staffing arrangements at security points in terminals.DAA has advised all passengers to be at the airport a minimum of two hours before boarding a short-haul flight and three hours prior to boarding a long-haul flight, although at peak times people should consider arriving ahead of that.Ryanair has advised passengers to arrive at least 3½ hours before their scheduled departure time."},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics ivana bacik on labour s past present and future","story":"Ivana Bacik’s uncontested election as Labour Party leader came after the swift removal of Alan Kelly from the role and her own relatively recent appointment as a TD in the Dublin Bay South by-election.

Photograph: John FlemingEngraving depicting the Halifax Gibbet, an early guillotine, or decapitating machine, used in the town of Halifax, West Yorkshire, England. Dated 17th century. Photograph:  Universal History ArchiveUniversal Images Group via Getty ImagesA huge After Eight sign the size of say 8,000 After-Eights towers the other side of the train tracks. Adjacent on another external wall of the sweet factory is an even larger illustration declaring “Quality Street: Proudly made in Halifax since 1936”. What time is the next train back to Leeds? These gags are too easy: it is scheduled for a little after eight. A metal electronic display box hangs from the platform rafters. Switched on, its showbiz lightbulb illumination conveys one word: “OFF”. Conceptually intriguing. A 39-minute train trip from Leeds, Halifax does not exactly sit in the popular consciousness. Apart from its titular financial institution to which it has, as it were, “lent” its name. While The Halifax is indeed in Halifax and its final X does indeed mark the spot, a stroll around the West Yorkshire town does much to extricate it from that bankable brand.And while there is indeed a Halifax branch there, along with the confectionery factory, visitors might suffer some semantic confusion about the town’s less-well-known identifier: the gibbet. This is conveniently found on Gibbet Street. But ask a random stranger the way: “You mean the device for lopping people’s heads off? Straight ahead.” Ask a second stranger: “You mean that gallows thing? Swing a right.”An innocuous square houses a 1974 reconstruction of this grisly execution device: the Halifax Gibbet. The bony-and-bleached-wood frame rises up from a tired concrete plinth. Its rusted metal plate fails to glint in the sun. For it is a mere dull substitute for the original blade, which is stored elsewhere for safety. This was a horrible place of execution for centuries of ill-fated petty criminals. Home and dryBut hope springs eternal if you cling to a local legend: The Running Man. This held out the promise that if, as a condemned man or woman, you freed your head once the blade started to descend and then legged it sharply the 500 yards to the other side of the boundary marking the jurisdiction, you were home and dry. The legend even has it that one man, John Lacey, managed this feat in 1617. A historical triumph for the underdog. Sadly – and in hindsight rather unwisely – some seven years later, poor Lacey crossed back into the clearly dangerous jurisdiction of Halifax. He was still a marked man. The long arm of the law got him again. The running man’s luck ran out and he was unable to escape a second decapitation.This brutal reminder of the perils of petty crime stands close to the Calderdale Sports and Social Club, and King’s Cross Carpets. For life goes on. The legendary Manchester band The Blue Orchids are even set to play in town tonight. (Eerily, they have a song called A Year With No Head. And another called The Hanging Man.) The venue is the Grayston Unity, a name conducive to the notion it might be some type of cult, a spiritual collective into which one might be absorbed and never be heard of again. Di’s PiesHalifax has other charms such as the Piece Hall – a vast colonnaded square once dedicated to the trading of the region’s wool and the best of its worsted products. A woman nearby sings a cover version of The Sound of Silence. Two cups of instant coffee (one with sugar) for two pounds are enjoyed in the Concorde Coffee House in the Victorian borough market. They wash down an award-winning pie from Di’s Pies.Halifax is peaceful, unhurried. But it perturbed me with a dark puzzle: why call a guillotine a gibbet when I had always understood a gibbet to be a gallows? Mystery is worn well by many towns. One man’s guillotine is another man’s gallows. Both are ghastly. At precisely a little after eight, the Grayston Unity door swings open. But there is no heaving crowd. No band tuning up. An ancient fear of arriving at the wrong venue resurfaces: “Where are The Blue Orchids playing? Is there an upstairs?” The barman apologises profusely. A sentence links a band member with the wretched Covid and explains the abrupt cancellation of the gig earlier that morning. “But we came over from Dublin . . .” He looks crestfallen. And so do we.But an evening in that lovely bar unfolds. The Halifax Grayston Unity. By the miracle of Facebook, cult singer Martin Bramah sends a friendly personal text. The ale is good. A bar client confides he is off to see Spandau Ballet linchpin Tony Hadley the next night – also in Halifax. He suggests tickets might still be available.

Photograph: TwitterA Conservative MP has revealed he was raped and blackmailed, he wants to transition to be a woman and also suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in a highly personal statement.Jamie Wallis was praised for his bravery after revealing that he is “not okay”, and for being open about having gender dysphoria.The Bridgend MP said: “I have never lived my truth and I’m not sure how”, but “perhaps it starts with telling everyone”.The message was posted online shortly before 3am, following a gathering for Tory MPs at which UK prime minister Boris Johnson reportedly made a joke about trans issues.Mr Johnson responded to Mr Wallis’ statement by saying: “Sharing this very intimate story would have taken an immense amount of courage.”He said the story would “undoubtedly support others” and “the Conservative Party I lead will always give you, and everyone else, the love and support you need to be yourself”.In his statement, Mr Wallis said: “I’m trans. Or to be more accurate, I want to be.“I’ve been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and I’ve felt this way since I was a very young child. I had no intention of ever sharing this with you. I always imagined I would leave politics well before I ever said this out loud.“There was a close call in April 2020 when someone blackmailed me, outed me to my father and sent photographs to other family members.“He wanted £50,000 to keep quiet. The police were so supportive, so understanding and on this occasion the system worked.”SentencedThe MP said the offender was sentenced to two years and nine months in prison after admitting his guilt.“For a while it seemed as though I would be able to get on with things and move on,” Mr Wallis wrote.“Being an MP and hiding something like this was always going to be tough, but I arrogantly assumed I was up for it.Giving details of the rape, the MP said: “I ‘hooked up’ with someone who I met online and when I chose to say ‘no’ on the basis that he wouldn’t wear a condom he chose to rape me.“I have not been myself since this incident and I don’t think I will ever recover. It is not something you ever forget, and it is not something you ever move on from.“Since then things have really taken a tumble. I am not okay.”The MP was arrested and subsequently fined over a car crash last year.Mr Wallis said he fled the scene following the crash in November “because I was terrified”.“I have PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) and I honestly have no idea what I was doing except I was overcome by an overwhelming sense of fear.”The personal statement came following the night out for Tory MPs, at which “I was reminded of the incredible support those you work with can provide”.“I’ve had a lot of support from the Whips since I was elected,” the MP said.“Not for the reasons you might think, but there’s a lot that goes on in MPs’ lives and the Whips play an important wellbeing role – as far as I’ve seen they try their best to support and help MPs who are having a tough time. Well they’ve certainly earned their keep with me.”Conservative MPs had gathered at the Park Plaza hotel in London, just across Westminster Bridge from the House of Commons.At the dinner, the Mr Johnson reportedly said: “Good evening ladies and gentleman, or as Keir Starmer would put it, people who are assigned female or male at birth.”The row over trans rights has been a key battle in so-called culture wars between the parties.Tory party chairman Oliver Dowden said: “Proud of my colleague Jamie Wallis.“As a Conservative family we stand together, and we will support you.“I hope that your brave statement will help others.”Fellow Tory MPs also showed their support for Mr Wallis, with former whip Mike Fabricant saying it was “a very brave statement”.Alicia Kearns said: “You have changed this country today Your bravery will give hope and courage to people across our country.“From the trans community, to survivors we all here for you, as you live your life as your true self, but ever as our friend.” – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"\u0026lsquoEntertainment is such a good way to bring forth change,\u0026rsquo says play\u0026rsquos narratorPhenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"keir starmer cannot say woman not fit pm","story":"It is the great new ide in British politics. No longer are the parties defined by their attitudes to taxation and spending. Gone are the days when great ideological arguments were joined over the limits of state interventionism. Worryingly, there is a growing pre-Thatcherite consensus emerging around these issues, a return to what was dubbed Butskellism in the late 1950s.No, the great schism today is gender based, or, more accurately, biological.Who could possibly disagree with that statement or find it remotely contentious? Obviously, a vanishingly small group of activists fulminated that this was somehow intolerant of people seeking to assert their gender identity through surgery, which it clearly wasn’t. But I suspect the vast majority of people are with the Prime Minister on this and would not consider what he said to be controversial or lacking in compassion.What on earth is he talking about? To find a way through what, exactly – how to say something that is true without being denounced by a handful of very vocal campaigners? Labour spokesmen have evidently decided to run away whenever they are asked a question that just a few years ago would not even have occurred to anyone.When Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, was asked recently to define what a woman is, she said she didn’t want to go down that “rabbit hole”. Anneliese Dodds, who speaks for Labour on women’s issues, got into an even bigger tangle when the same question was put to her. “It does depend on the context surely. There are people who have decided that they have to make that transition... because they live as a woman they want to be defined as a woman.”Her comments prompted the author JK Rowling to suggest Ms Dodds might be in need of both a dictionary and a backbone. And therein lies the point. This is no longer a debate about gender but free speech.Rowling, the country’s most successful living writer, has been excoriated for seeking to defend the rights of women from the trans lobby’s encroachment on their hard-won advances over the decades. She is a big enough international figure to withstand the brickbats. According to her publishers Bloomsbury, the sales of her Harry Potter books remain unaffected by the stand she has taken.The same cannot be said for Graham Linehan. Few people have made me laugh as much over the years as Linehan, whose Father Ted and The IT Crowd are masterpieces of the surreal comedy genre. Yet because he has fallen foul of trans activists by standing up for women’s rights, his entire career has been trashed. He broke down during a TV interview at the weekend as he described how he had lost his commissions and his marriage had collapsed. A stage musical version of Father Ted has been axed just as it was in rehearsals, while media companies and showbusiness friends have turned their backs on him. “They took everything from me,” he said.But who are “they”? At least with the Inquisition you knew who was behind it and what the consequences were for challenging theological orthodoxy decreed by the medieval Church. But who are today’s Torquemadas metaphorically dragging heretics to the stake?This is being perpetrated by pusillanimous politicians, craven corporate bosses and spineless luvvies who lack the guts to stand up to the new fanaticism, even if it means trampling on the rights of those who are prepared to confront it. They fear that they will be targeted and yet it is in their hands to end the madness by not “cancelling” those deemed by a tiny minority to have uttered something they don’t like.Unless politicians like Sir Keir call this nonsense out, the lunatic fringe will prevail and the voters will take note of who stood where, not least women who see their rights being so carelessly set aside.The Labour leader has claimed that the law states that trans women are women, drawing a withering response from Rowling who said it was “yet another indication that the Labour Party can no longer be counted on to defend women’s rights”.They cannot be counted on either to defend the right to free speech by supporting those, even in their own party, who disagree with what is an eminently contestable point of view. Angela Rayner, the party’s deputy leader, sank deeper into the mire yesterday by saying it was reasonable “in some circumstances” to ask a trans man if they were pregnant. She added: “It wouldn’t be a reasonable question for me to say ‘Have you got a penis or not?’ because that’s not acceptable.” But no one is suggesting that. It is an Aunt Sally to duck the real issue. No sensible person wants to see trans people ostracised.Labour suffered at the polls in 2019 because it was led by someone who voters thought totally unsuitable to be prime minister. Traditional Labour seats fell like ninepins not necessarily because they had warmed to Boris but because Jeremy Corbyn was considered weak and unpatriotic.Sir Keir and his front-bench team are alienating voters once again with their absurd refusal to say what everyone knows to be true on the spurious grounds that it would be intolerant to do so. Yet the bigotry is coming from radical trans activists, not the other way round, by shutting down the very discussion that Sir Keir said he is so anxious to have but clearly isn’t.A politician who refuses to say whether a woman has a penis or a man a cervix is not fit to lead a government. If he carries on doing so he never will.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Putin ‘feels misled by Russian military’ and has lost trust in top brassPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson dismisses claims he misled Parliament over \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 - watch PM live\u0026#39Ukrainians should be allowed to decide their future\u0026#39: Readers on peace talks with RussiaFace masks to stay in Scotland as Nicola Sturgeon delays lifting Covid rules againBeing ‘the party of the NHS’ is a poisoned chalice for the ToriesCovid jab to be ‘an annual vaccine’ instead of four-monthly boosterMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid jab annual vaccine instead four monthly booster","story":"The four-monthly Covid vaccination booster programme cannot continue, Sir Patrick Vallance has warned, as he said the NHS is likely to move to an annual jab for those most at risk, similar to flu.The Government\u0027s Chief Scientific Advisor (GCSA) said Britain needed to move to a ‘sensible annual cycle’ of immunisation which ensured that the vulnerable are protected.Speaking at the Science and Technology Select Committee, Sir Patrick said: “What isn’t credible is to start having vaccines every four months for everybody. That’s just not the way this works. “What I think it will probably look like will be annual vaccines for a certain part of the population as we have for flu. “What we need to move to though, is a better understanding of how to predict which vaccine is required each year. There are lots of possibilities. You could choose to go after the latest variant, you could choose to try and design a vaccine that fits somewhere in the middle and covers everybody. “We have to move to a sensible annual cycle.”A fourth jab is due to be rolled out for over-75s, care home residents and the immunocompromised in the coming weeks but it is unclear whether younger healthy people will still be offered Covid jabs next winter.Currently, people offered the flu jab include the over-50s, people with underlying health conditions, pregnant women, care home residents, carers, frontline health staff and those with housemates at risk of infection.Sir Patrick said that although coronavirus case numbers are high, there was evidence that the current surge was coming to an end and that severity of Covid was being kept under control by vaccines and other measures.He said there were no plans at present to recall the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which stood down at the beginning of March and said if it was brought back it may ‘not necessarily be the same group of people’.“We’ve got very high levels of infection at the moment, as indeed many other countries do,” he said.“I think the number of infections is beginning to turn, so we may be quite close or at the peak and it may start coming down shortly.”Sir Patrick also said it was important to look back at lockdown and “dissect” which parts had worked. He said it was clear that there were “detrimental effects” from lockdown and said it was something that should not be undertaken lightly in future.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Putin ‘feels misled by Russian military’ and has lost trust in top brassPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson dismisses claims he misled Parliament over \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 - watch PM live\u0026#39Ukrainians should be allowed to decide their future\u0026#39: Readers on peace talks with RussiaFace masks to stay in Scotland as Nicola Sturgeon delays lifting Covid rules againBeing ‘the party of the NHS’ is a poisoned chalice for the ToriesTwo-year-old boy dies after being attacked by dogMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"grammar school teacher suspended prophet muhammad mug","story":"A grammar school teacher has been suspended after they allegedly used a mug with an image depicting the Prophet Mohammed.The staff member at Colchester Royal Grammar School in Essex is said to have been photographed with the item, which had a picture from a cartoon series called \u0027Jesus And Mo\u0027 on it.They have been suspended from their role, according to a PA Media source.A spokesman for the school said: We have been notified that an image has been shared online of an inidual appearing to use a cup that has an offensive image on it.At this time we are looking into the matter.While we cannot comment on iniduals, this will be reviewed in line with our policies and procedures and the appropriate robust action taken as necessary.The staff member concerned is currently away from the school.An Ofsted report, published last year, found that leaders in the school had not ensured that boys understand how to interact appropriately with girls, and some male pupils could be rude and make inappropriate remarks.It concluded that parts of the school had become a hostile environment for some pupils.Colchester Royal Grammar was also accused last year of having a toxic and ubiquitous rape culture, in a blog post by former student Scarlett Mansfield.Headmaster John Russell wrote at the time that he was shocked and saddened by reports of wholly unacceptable behaviours and attitudes that some female students experienced during their time at the institution.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson dismisses claims he misled Parliament over \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 - watch PM liveRussia-Ukraine latest news: Putin ‘feels misled by Russian military’ and has lost trust in top brass\u0026#39Ukrainians should be allowed to decide their future\u0026#39: Readers on peace talks with RussiaFace masks to stay in Scotland as Nicola Sturgeon delays lifting Covid rules againBeing ‘the party of the NHS’ is a poisoned chalice for the ToriesCovid jab to be ‘an annual vaccine’ instead of four-monthly boosterMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"monarchy opposite anachronistic","story":"Memorials are inherently elegiac, backward-looking events, but this one perfectly captured a forward-looking man. Of course the great and the good flocked solemnly into Westminster Abbey yesterday to remember the Duke of Edinburgh: enough military and religious figures to people a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. But accompanying them came an inspiring cohort of the next generation: young representatives of the Duke’s eponymous award scheme in purple cagoules. Leading the tributes was a former DofE gold winner from East London, who described how the experience had transformed her life. At 45 minutes long, the memorial conformed perfectly to the Duke’s unstuffy dictum on church services – “keep it short”.Today’s monarchy shares many of Prince Philip’s defining qualities, though cynics delight in misrepresenting the institution as an anachronism. Some assume also that there is an inevitability to the UK one day becoming a republic. The Commonwealth faces an even more perilous future, they say, citing the Cambridges’ Caribbean tour, which was pilloried for looking outdated. But this is to misread both the monarchy’s purpose and its inherent strengths. The institution is not just sound – as Prince Philip proved, it can be modern and far more in touch with the public than Westminster. As politicians imposed lockdown rules on the public and were often caught flouting them, the Queen remained a paragon of duty. Prince Charles, too, has shown great foresight. The Prince’s Trust, his passion for eco-friendly projects, even his architectural views have aged well. The monarchy, many say, must move with the times, but again and again the institution proves it is capable of exactly that. Perhaps more Commonwealth nations will choose to become republics in the coming years and if so, then the Royal family will say a cordial goodbye. But the extent to which that would reflect popular opinion is debatable. Barbadians, for instance, were not consulted before their government abruptly cut ties with the monarchy last year – perhaps fearing their citizens might give the “wrong” answer. It might also have a little something to do with China pouring billions into the Caribbean – money which, unlike British aid, comes with strings attached. Few of those amplifying demands for reparations have questioned how these calls square with accepting vast sums from a country that is enslaving the Uyghurs today. Coverage of the Jamaican leg of the Cambridges’ tour dwelt heavily on the so-called “gaffes” – a republican politician apparently giving the Duchess the cold shoulder, the 60 activists who protested at one venue. But what of the much larger crowds who turned out to welcome them? The “decline of the monarchy” narrative often looks like motivated reasoning by republicans who’d like the institution to go, and reframe things accordingly. As a monarchist, I might be accused of a similar mindset. But though few things in our politics are stable these days, it is remarkable just how little public feeling has changed. In polls, republicanism nearly always hovers around one fifth rarely moving beyond a core group of committed opponents. Were the neo-Jacobin planets to align, with, let’s say, a persuasive political movement coinciding with a particularly hapless king or queen, it could still be monarchical kryptonite. Yet those next in line – Charles and Camilla, William and Kate – appear safe pairs of hands. And given the current incentives to enter politics, is the quality of our politicians likely to soar in the coming years, or plummet? This is one of the great strengths of constitutional monarchy – that they are not politicians, and offer a stability and non-partisanship that has become depressingly rare. After Covid, Partygate, rows engulfing everything from Winston Churchill to Harry Potter, the value of possessing at least one defiantly non-political institution is hard to measure. Since elected heads of state tend to be retired politicians, they are often isive figures – think President Blair or Major, President Farage or (God save us), President Corbyn. The institution does not just transcend politics it is bigger than inidual family members too – yes, even the disgraced Prince Andrew, who controversially escorted his mother yesterday. Though the Sussexes inflicted great damage in their Oprah interview, the longer they seek to monetise their position, the more it could also backfire and accentuate the quiet service that the Queen and other royals provide. But perhaps the monarchy’s greatest gift is its ability to spark joy among millions of its subjects. The Royal family adds – literally – to the gaiety of nations in a way that no elected head of state ever could. Etched into memories of my 90s childhood is the image of the Queen Mother at some official function, invariably beaming from ear to ear in one of her mad hats that seemed to spray feathers or flower petals in all directions. Replace this with… what, exactly? More politics, more politicians, more grey suits, more ision. Our monarchy is a welcome retreat from the culture wars – it would be a disaster to allow that narrative to destroy it.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Putin ‘feels misled by Russian military’ and has lost trust in top brassPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson dismisses claims he misled Parliament over \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 - watch PM live\u0026#39Ukrainians should be allowed to decide their future\u0026#39: Readers on peace talks with RussiaBeing ‘the party of the NHS’ is a poisoned chalice for the ToriesCovid jab to be ‘an annual vaccine’ instead of four-monthly boosterMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon delays lifting face mask rule","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has postponed scrapping the legal requirement to wear face masks in Scotland for a second time, blaming the UK\u0027s highest Covid rates for the delay.The First Minister told MSPs that, from next Monday, Scots will no longer have to wear a covering in places of worship or while attending a marriage ceremony, funeral or commemorative event.But the legal requirement to wear a mask in other indoor public places, such as in shops and on public transport, will only be converted to guidance on April 18.Ms Sturgeon admitted wearing masks was an inconvenience but argued that the delay took account of the very high level of infection in Scotland and the pressure on the NHS.The First Minister said the vast majority of Scots would accept the decision was a proportionate precautionary measure while we pass the peak of the latest wave.But Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, said that while Scotland was the only part of the UK to still have a legal requirement to wear masks, the higher infection levels in the country showed that Ms Sturgeon\u0027s strategy had failed.He accused her of refusing to trust the Scottish public to make their own decisions over where and when it was appropriate for them to wear face coverings.The Office for National Statistics has estimated that one in 11 people had the virus in Scotland in the week ending March 19. This compared with one in 15 people in England, one in 17 in Northern Ireland and one in 25 in Wales.SNP ministers have blamed the new BA2 type of the omicron, which is more transmissible, claiming it had seeded in Scotland more quickly than in the rest of the UK.But Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, an expert on coronaviruses from Edinburgh University, has warned the effect of mask wearing without many of the other restrictions in place is small, or it\u0027s smaller than it ever was before.She told BBC Radio Scotland on Wednesday: I think recommendations for people to wear masks in high-risk environments is the right course of action, it doesn\u0027t need that legal enforcement any more.Ms Sturgeon had promised to scrap the requirement to wear face coverings on March 21, along with all other remaining legal restrictions, but she instead delayed lifting the rule indefinitely.She then said that our expectation now is that this regulation will convert to guidance in early April but she told MSPs she had delayed the shift again.The wider legal requirement - applying to shops, certain other indoor settings and public transport - will be converted to guidance two weeks later on April 18, she said.We will, of course, continue to encourage the wearing of face coverings in certain indoor places, especially where significant numbers of people are present.Ms Sturgeon added: This phased approach strikes a sensible balance between our desire to remove this one remaining legal measure and the common sense need for continued caution - not least for the sake of the NHS - while this wave of infection subsides.I recognise that face coverings are an inconvenience. However, given all the sacrifice of the past two years, and in view of the current pressure on the NHS, I believe the vast majority of people will accept that for a further two weeks this is a proportionate precautionary measure while we pass the peak of this latest wave.It also provides some further protection to those who are most at risk from the virus. More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Putin ‘feels misled by Russian military’ and has lost trust in top brassPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson dismisses claims he misled Parliament over \u0026#39partygate\u0026#39 - watch PM live\u0026#39Ukrainians should be allowed to decide their future\u0026#39: Readers on peace talks with RussiaBeing ‘the party of the NHS’ is a poisoned chalice for the ToriesCovid jab to be ‘an annual vaccine’ instead of four-monthly boosterTwo-year-old boy dies after being attacked by dogMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"downing street refuse say 20","story":"Downing Street refuse to say  Partygate staff broke law - read the toe-curling exchangeThe Met Police have handed out  fines for Downing Street lockdown law-breaking - yet in a bizarre exchange, Downing Street repeatedly refused to say they broke the lawthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video partygate-keir-starmer-asks-boris-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:CKOlyq,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,prebidUseTestRuntime:true,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mantisRecommender.recommenderMaxMpuNumber:,mantisRecommender.autoplayInterval:,nonIframeMantisRecommender:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,amp.trackonomics.enabled:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,mantisRecommender.useIntTracking:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,authUI.default:true,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,adServedMastheadStripEnabled:true,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,mantisRecommender.hbEnabled:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,amp.stickyAdRefresh:,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,M.apiUrl:https:partner-widget-api-prod.tm-awx monitizer  compare prices gbp_en,publicationName:Mirror,mantisRecommender.limit:,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,authUI.version:ffefdecbcae,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,trackonomics.id:reachplc_cDEYX_mirror,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,convoStarterEnabled:true,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Met Police announced yesterday it would hand out  fixed penalty noticesto people who attended parties in Downing Street and Whitehall during Covid lockdowns. Scotland Yard warned more fines could be dished out in future - with Boris Johnsonaposs own situation still hanging in the balance. Tory ministers gave police the power to hand out FPNs from they reasonably believed someone had committed an offence.And Justice Secretary Dominic Raab today accepted the  people fined over Partygate had broken the law. The Deputy PM said: Clearly there were breaches of the regulations - that’s the only thing that could warrant the  fixed penalty notices.Keir Starmer suggested Boris Johnson had lied to Parliament when he said all guidance was followed in No.Yet the PM still appeared to be in denial. Pressed over Mr Johnson’s view yesterday, his spokesman said: “It’s for the Met to make that judgment, rather than the Prime Minister.”Today, No stood by that line in a toe-curling briefing to journalists. We have reproduced a large segment of it below. To spare our sanity, and yours, weaposve not included every single question. The questions are from ious journalists and the answers are interchangeable from the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman and his Press Secretary. Does the PM agree with Dominic Raab that breaches of the regulations are the only thing that could warrant fixed penalty notices  “The Prime Minister said he respects the position of the Met, equally that this investigation is ongoing… you will hear more from him at the conclusion.”He respects the position - does he agree with it  “As I say, my position hasn’t changed from yesterday”.He doesn’t agree with Dominic Raab on that then, who explicitly said rules were broken and the law was broken  That’s something you wouldn’t bring yourself to say yesterday. Are you still maintaining that position, or do you agree with the Justice Secretary  “We are maintaining that position”.So you disagree with the Justice Secretary on whether the law has been broken  “You’ve got my position from yesterday - it hasn’t changed.”Isn’t the Justice Secretary, being the Justice Secretary, in quite a good position to determine whether the law has been broken or not  “As I say, there is an ongoing process here. The Met have come to a conclusion and started a process which relates to  fines and we fully respect that. What I’m saying is you will hear more from the Prime Minister at the conclusion of that process, rather than in the middle of it.Given the PM and No clearly disagree with what the Justice Secretary said this morning, is he going to be having a word  “I wouldn’t characterise it like that… we respect the process but the investigation is not complete and we want to wait until the investigation is complete before commenting on that.”So you do agree with the Justice Secretary then  “All I’m saying is…”It’s one or other isn’t it  Either you agree with him or you don’t  “Our position on this hasn’t changed. We respect the process and there is an ongoing investigation so we need to wait for that to complete.”Did the Justice Secretary mis-speak  “He’s been setting out the view, the Met have set out their view, and we respect the conclusions they have come to. But I’m saying we will not be commenting further on the detail of what happened until the investigation is complete.”But you don’t respect it, do you  Because you’re saying you don’t accept that rules were broken  “That’s not what we’re saying. We’re saying we respect what the Met are saying, but as the PM said today, an investigation is still ongoing and there are not further details at this point so we need to wait for the investigation to complete in order to comment further.”In these  cases, they are complete. Does the PM accept in these  cases, the law was broken  It’s concluded. There’s nothing  to say. “And of course we accept that, the Met are independent, they’re making decisions as they go throughout this investigation which remains a live investigation. It would not be right for me to give the Prime Minister’s view in the midst of an ongoing police investigation.”Isn’t this actually about the fact thatthe Prime Minister himself gets a fine, you don’t want to have to concede he’s broken the law  “Well, we talked about that hypothetical situation before. We will come forward and confirm thatit were to happen and of course you’d hear from the Prime Minister.” Why is it dficult for you to comment on the  cases  Have the Met said anything to you about that, asking you not to  “It’s a clearof the fact there is an ongoing Met Police investigation and we want to comment once that has concluded, not in the midst of it. And obviously the Met have set out their process where they are issuing  fines and they’ve said they may be going further, so we are not going to comment in the midst of that, but we respect the Met’s process.Why do you think the Lord Chancellor has a dferent view on whether you can comment on the  cases at this point  “You’ve asked our position, we’ve set it out.”Can you see why the position is a bit surreal from where we stand  The police are saying the law has been broken, the Justice Secretary who oversees laws is saying the law has been broken, but you won’t say the law has been broken. We don’t quite understand why you’re adopting that very strange position. “Well look, I think people will understand that… we wouldn’t be commenting during a live police investigation. We are maintaining that position that we set out. The Prime Minister commissioned both the Sue Gray inquiry that has led onto this, and we want to allow that to conclude in full before commenting in detail. In general terms, does the government believe a person who has been handed a fixed penalty notice has committed an offence  “I’m not debating what happens when an inidual receives a fixed penalty notice, and we’ve talked about some of the processes around that.”Sorry,you’re not debating it, what are you saying happensan inidual is handed a fixed penalty  “I’m simply saying I’m not going to be commenting in the midst of an ongoing investigation.”Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonConservative PartyScotland Yardpolitan PolicePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Labour will force a binding vote on the release of information given to Boris Johnson before Lord Lebedev was made a peer, following reports the Prime Minister overruled concerns raised by MI and MI. Using a parliamentary mechanism called a Humble Address, Angela Rayner will call on Cabinet Office minister Steve Barclay to make public the details concerning the appointment. The Cabinet Office plays a central role in the vetting process of Lords.Lord Lebedev, who owns both the London Evening Standard and the Independent, got his wealth from his Russian oligarch father Alexander Lebedev, a former KGB security officer. The crossbench peer is known to be close to the Prime Minister, having previously hosted him at a party at his Italian mansion in , when Mr Johnson was Foreign Secretary.Labouraposs Deputy Leader said the government has questions to answer over the appointment and transparency was now an important matter of national security amid Vladimir Putinaposs invasion of Ukraine.She said: The Prime Minister has allowed his friendship with the son and business partner of an ex-KGB agent to blind his primary duty to the British public – to keep them safe.  The Prime Minister has once again put personal interest before the publicaposs, and this time heaposs risked national security. “The British public have a right to knowand how an inidual of apparent concern to our intelligence services was granted a seat in the heart of our Parliament by Boris Johnson, against security advice. “This Government’s dangerous links to Putin’s oligarchs are putting Britain at risk.”The Prime Minister’s former aide, Dominic Cummings, said he was in the room when Mr Johnson was told by Cabinet Office officials that the “intelligence services and other parts of the deep state” had “serious reservations” about the PM’s plan to appoint Lord Lebedev.Deputy Prime Minister, however, has previously said it is “sheer nonsense” to suggest that Boris Johnson had asked anyone in the security services to revise, reconsider or withdraw their assessment of the media mogul. Mr Raab said all iniduals nominated for a peerage are done so in recognition of what their contribution is to society. “And, I should say, that includes those of Russian origin who contribute brilliantly to our nation, many of whom in this country are critics of the Putin regime, he said, when pressed over the matter by Ms Rayner in the Commons.

The -year-old said everything stood still when medics told her they had discovered cancerous cells during a mammogram in November. Ms Butler said she was taking time off to recover from her recent surgery but early diagnosis means it is something that I will get through and over. In a statement, she said: Everything stood still as it does when you hear the dreaded C-word - it is a shock but an early diagnosis means that it is something that I will get through and over.The NHS has caught my cancer early, the operation was a complete success, and I will make a full recovery. However, I now have to take time off work for my recovery. Everyone who knows me knows that I am a workaholic and I love what I do - but unless I listen to medical advice and recover well, I will not be able to give my best.I would like to thank Parliament, the Labour Party, local members and my team for their support throughout.The Brent Central MP paid tribute to NHS staff, saying she had seen first-hand how the NHS is under enormous pressure when receiving treatment at the Royal London Hospital. She added: The Royal London seemed full, people were waiting on chairs in AE for beds, the staff were exhausted in the NHS and many were suffering from PTSD. Covid- has taken a lot out of them.So many people have missed appointments , results are delayed and operations postponed. If we are to show our appreciation for the amazing NHS workers and rebuild our health service then we need to properly invest in the NHS, both structurally and in the very people who keep it ing.Labour leader Keir Starmer tweeted: Dawn, your bravery, strength and determination shine through.I am sorry you’re going through this, but know that I, and the whole Party, are behind you.

Sir Keir said: He told the House no rules were broken in Downing Street during lockdown. The police have now concluded there was widespread criminality. The Ministerial Code says that ministers who knowingly mislead the House should resign. Why is he still here  Boris Johnson scoffed hang on a minute! and accused Keir Starmer of being a human weather vane after the Labour leader stopped short of repeating his call for the PMaposs resignation last week.  The PM said the Met Police - whoaposve warned they could issue more fines beyond the  anonymous ones so far - must “get on with their job” adding: We are going to get on with our job.But Keir Starmer said: There are only two possible explanations.“Either he’s trashing the Ministerial Code, or he’s claiming he was repeatedly lied to by his own advisors and that he didn’t know what was going on in his own house and his own office. “Come off it! “He really does think it’s one rule for him and another rule for everyone  - that he can pass off criminality in his own office and ask others to follow the law.” Labouraposs leader added: When is he going to stop taking the British public for fools  It came after Boris Johnsonaposs deputy today finally admitted  staff broke the law over Covid lockdown parties - after No bizarrely tried to avoid saying they did.Dominic Raab also confirmed ministers like Rishi Sunak will inevitably disclosethey get fined. So far, No has only pledged to name Boris Johnson and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case.Scotland Yard yesterday said it would hand out  fines to people over parties in Downing Street and Whitehall.Yet the PM still appeared to be in denial. Pressed over Mr Johnson’s view, his spokesman said: “It’s for the Met to make that judgment, rather than the Prime Minister.”Today Mr Raab, who is the Justice Secretary and once prosecuted war crimes, accepted the  fined people broke the law saying: Clearly there were breaches of the regulations - that’s the only thing that could warrant the  fixed penalty notices”. Last night Boris Johnson threw a glitzy bash for Tory MPs, hours after the Met confirmed Downing Street lockdown parties had broken the law. The PM hosted around  MPs for dinner at a central London hotel as he attempted to bolster his leadership and draw a line under the Partygate scandal. Politicians were set to dine on salmon tart, chicken thighs and a chocolate praline dessert, washed down with fine wines. Top Tories walked past families who lost loved ones to Covid, who held a candlelit vigil in protest outside Londonaposs Park Plaza hotel and shouted at MPs: Off to another party, are we  One Tory MP, Michael Fabricant, told the waiting media the party would be a lot of fun adding: Itaposs great, we had a photo taken, it was absolutely super. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford blasted: Last night millions of families will have been desperately trying to figure out how they will possibly afford the £ energy price hike that will hit them this Friday. At the very same time, Tory MPs were gathering across the street for a champagne bash in the Park Plaza. We all know the Tories partied during lockdown and now they’re partying through this cost-of-living emergency. Earlier Keir Starmer blasted the PM and “cynical” Chancellor Rishi Sunak for putting the  Tory re-election campaign over and above helping people pay their bills by promising a p income tax cut. The PM insisted he was still a “tax-cutting Conservative” - but Keir Starmer told Mr Johnson to “cut the nonsense and treat the British people with a bit of respect”. He said the Tories were imposing  tax rises, bringing the tax burden to its highest for  years and for every £ taken in tax rises, £ is given back. “Is that cutting taxes or is it raising taxes ” he mocked. Boris Johnson fumed: “I don’t know where he’s been the last two years…. “Even for Captain Hindsight, to obliterate the biggest pandemic for the last century from his memory, to obliterate the £bn we’ve had to spend… is quite extraordinary.” But Keir Starmer said: “I can only hope that his police questionnaire was bit more convincing than that. This year British people face the worst fall in living standards on record. While they are counting every penny, the Prime Minister is hitting them with higher taxes.“But in  when there just so happens to be a general election, they will introduce a small tax cut. That is not taking dficult decisions, itaposs putting the Tory re-election campaign over and above helping people pay their bills. How did he find a Chancellor as utterly cynical as he is  Prime Minister Boris Johnson replied: What we have is a Chancellor who took the tough decisions to look after the UK economy throughout the pandemic, who protected people up and down the land with £ billion worth of support. And by the way,we had listened to them,we had listened to Captain Hindsight, we would not have come out of lockdown in July last year. We would have stayed in lockdown over Christmas and New Year, with the result that the UK economy would not be growing in the way that it is. And so we would not be able to make the investments that we now are and under Labour we would have to tax more and borrow more and they cannot be trusted with the economy.

Chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite told the Government that the firm would not U-turn on the decision to fire hundreds of seafarers to replace them with cheaper agency staff. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps gave the firm an ultimatum to rehire staff on their previous wages or face consequences.But the PO boss wrote to Mr Shapps claiming his request ignores the situationaposs fundamental and factual realities. Re-employing the sacked workers on their previous wages would deliberately cause the companyaposs collapse, resulting in the irretrievable loss of an additional , jobs, the letter said.  I cannot imagine that you would wish to compel an employer to bring about its own downfall, affecting not hundreds but thousands of families. When PO Ferries announced its decision to replace its crews with cheaper agency workers, it stated that the business needed to cut costs to survive as it was losing £ million a year. Mr Hebblethwaite also rejected Mr Shappsapos request that Thursdayaposs deadline for sacked workers to accept redundancy offers is delayed, as more than  of the  affected people have taken steps to accept the settlement offer. He wrote: These are legally binding agreements, and crew members who have entered them will rightly expect us to comply with their terms. He also resisted calls for him to quit - despite Mr Shapps describing his position as untenable. Mr Hebblethwaite wrote: I am fully cognisant of the reputational cost to the PO Ferries brand and me personally. That notwithstanding, I am compelled to discharge my duties for this historical company, saving the jobs of the , dedicated employees who continue working for PO Ferries and providing for the effective operation of the trade routes upon which this country depends. It comes after he admitted to MPs last week that the firm chose to break the law by failing to consult staff and unions before sacking staff by Zoom call.The ferry boss also confirmed the average wage among aposreplacementapos employees on PO vessels will be £. an hour - well below the minimum wage. The chairmen of the Commons’ transport and business select committees urged the Government to strip PO Ferries of its licence on Monday.Tory MP Huw Merriman and Labour MP Darren Jones wrote: “Our immediate concern is the welfare and employment rights of the  seafarers made redundant by PO Ferries.“Government has not moved sufficiently quickly to support them. Going forward, ministers must prioritise the wellbeing of those  seafarers.” They added: “The Government should prosecute PO Ferries and remove its licence to operate in the UK.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CabinetPO FerriesGrant Shapps\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

His claim to MPs that he drives a VW Golf was challenged by sources claiming the multi-millionaire also has a Range Rover in North Yorkshire and a BMW and Lexus in the US.Borrowing a Sainsbury’s worker’s Kia for a petrol photo stunt was stupid, and not only because he later tried to scan a can of Coke on the filling station’s card reader, suggesting he is a stranger to everyday tasks and costs.

Sunak has had a privileged private education, banked a fortune speculating in international finance and married an heiress. He should be honest about his good fortune and help struggling people instead of hurting them.  Zelensky hope President Volodymyr Zelensky is prepared to discuss Ukraine’s future neutrality in peace talks, showing a willingness to compromise that alas is as yet unmatched by invader Vladimir Putin. Hopefully saner voices will prevail in the Kremlin after reports that Roman Abramovich, the Cha FC owner allegedly close to Putin, and two Ukrainian negotiators showed symptoms of suspected poisoning after a meeting in Kyiv earlier this month. Claims that mayors have been kidnapped in Ukraine suggest Putin is vengeful as his military forces suffer heavy losses. Zelensky never gives up hope.

Putin has surrounded himself with a tight inner circle of trusted staff. But Western officials doubt the loyal acolytes can be honest with or have influence over their feared leader. One Western official said: “Eventhey were capable of influencing him, would they be prepared to tell him the truth about the fairly disastrous progress of this campaign “I think we are much less certain that he is getting an honest picture on the ground.” Russian setbacks and Ukrainian resistance since Kremlin troops invaded on February  have stunned military experts - and triggered bitter infighting among the Russian hierarchy. Another official said: “I think it’s also likely that within the Russian system ious elements are going to be blaming each other for the lack of success, so that’s going to also complicate the challenge for the truth getting through.  “People will be being quite defensive about their own failures, and, I think, looking to point the finger at others.” Reported retreats by Moscow forces were evidence of “just how badly President Putin has miscalculated”, they added. Kremlin spies were guilty of a “catastrophic” intelligence failure in the run-up to the invasion, according to Western officials. Russians were said to believe that Ukrainians would welcome them over the border. There have also been claims that agents who realised the potential pitfalls of waging war were too scared to tell superiors. An official said: “There’s a lot of self-reflection in the intelligence services that they misjudged catastrophically the Ukrainian national mood. “To the extent that they got it right, they didn’t communicate it properly.”Praising Ukrainian resistance, the official said the war was “creating -it did not exist before - a sense of Ukrainian sacrice and nationhood and an unwillingness to submit to Russia, which will last for generations probably and will make this country impossible to subdue for Russia”. Boris Johnson held phone talks with fellow leaders US President Joe Biden, French Premier Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian PM Mario Draghi.A No spokeswoman said they “agreed on the ongoing need to support and sustain the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian barbarism”. She added: “The Prime Minister underscored that we must judge Putin’s regime by their actions not their words.“Putin is twisting the kne in the open wound of Ukraine in an attempt to force the country and its allies to capitulate.“The Prime Minister stressed to his fellow leaders that we should be unrelenting in our response.”Meanwhile, Western agencies continue to examine claims Cha FC owner Roman Abramovich, who has been sanctioned by the UK Government, was poisoned on a trip to Kyiv where he was helping with peace talks. An official said: “They are obviously extremely concerning allegations. “Let’s just say the Russian system has form in terms of utilising chemical weapons.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Olaf ScholzBoris JohnsonRoman AbramovichEmmanuel MacronJoe BidenVladimir PutinPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jamie Wallis, the Tory MP for Bridgend in south Wales since , shared the news in a statement in the early hours today. The statement on Dr Wallisapos website said: I’m trans. Or to be more accurate, I want to be. I’ve been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and I’ve felt this way since I was a very young child. I had no intention of ever sharing this with you. I always imagined I would leave politics well before I ever said this out loud. The MP went on: Being an MP and hiding something like this was always going to be tough, but I arrogantly assumed I was up for it. Well, I’m not. Dr Wallis was praised by campaigners and MP colleagues. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who last night made a joke about trans issues in a speech to MPs, said at PMQs: The House stands with you and will give you the support you need to live freely as yourself. Keir Starmer echoed his comments. The PM tweeted: Sharing this very intimate story would have taken an immense amount of courage. Thank you @JamieWallisMP for your bravery, which will undoubtedly support others. The Conservative Party I lead will always give you, and everyone , the love and support you need to be yourself. Minister for Women and Equalities Liz Truss wrote: Well done Jamie Wallis for speaking out and your brave statement. We stand with you. Tory party chairman Oliver Dowden said: Proud of my colleague Jamie Wallis. As a Conservative family we stand together, and we will support you. I hope that your brave statement will help others.Conservative Tom Tugendhat said this is a very brave statement, while Labouraposs Angela Eagle tweeted: This is very brave. Look after yourself and take the time you need to recover. Labour MP Chris Bryant wrote: Dear Jamie I wish you all the very best. Colleagues across the House will respect your openness honesty and the journey you are on. Cwtch.Benjamin Cohen, the chief executive of Pink News, added: This is truly groundbreaking, the UK’s first MP to share that they are trans. The LGBT+ Conservatives group tweeted: Asking for help  seeking comfort in those around you isn’t always easy. The group told the MP it was also in your support network - and are always here to support you whenever you need. You’ve always been there for us, now it’s our turn. In the online post Dr Wallis said they had been a victim of separate crimes of blackmail and rape, after which things have really taken a tumble adding: I am not OK. The MP wrote: There was a close call in April  when someone Blackmailed me, outed me to my father and sent photographs to other family members. He wanted £, to keep quiet. The police were so supportive, so understanding and on this occasion the system worked. He pled guilty and was sentenced to yrs and mnths in prison. After describing an incident of rape, the MP went on: I have not been myself since this incident and I don’t think I will ever recover. It is not something you ever forget, and it is not something you ever move on from. Dr Wallis was arrested on suspicion of driving while unfit after colliding into a lamp post in November. In the overnight web statement, the MP wrote: I fled the scene. I did so because I was terried. I have PTSD and I honestly have no idea what I was doing except I was overcome by an overwhelming sense of fear. I am sorry that it appears I aposran awayapos but this isn’t how it happened in the moment.The MP praised the support of colleagues and Conservative whips, after Boris Johnson hosted a dinner for Tory MPs at a London hotel. According to reports, the Prime Minister opened his speech with a joke saying: Good evening ladies and gentleman, or as Keir Starmer would put it, people who are assigned female or male at birth.However, Dr Wallis wrote: Tonight, I was reminded of the incredible support those you work with can provide. Also, I was reminded how important it is to be yourself. I have never lived my truth and I’m not sure how. Perhaps it starts with telling everyone. Trans rights, and how to describe trans people, have become a topic of bitter debate in Westminster.In , ministers scrapped plans to make it easier for trans people to change their legal gender after campaigners raised concerns about biological sex and the preservation of women-only spaces.Trans people still need a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria, evidence they have lived in their assumed gender for two years, agreement from their spouse, and to have their bid approved by a  of medics and judges. Human rights groups and LGBT rights group Stonewall condemned the government for falling far short on its promise of reform. Boris Johnson last week said the issue requires extreme sensitivity, tact, love and care. We must recognise that when people want to make a transition in their lives, they should be treated with the maximum possible generosity and respect. We have systems in this country that allow that and have done for a long time, and we should be very proud of that, but I want to say in addition that I think, when it comes to distinguishing between a man and a woman, the basic facts of biology remain overwhelmingly important. Boris Johnson’s Press Secretary twice refused to sayhe regretted his joke about trans people, instead telling journalists: “You’ve heard him direct Jamie directly”. Askedhe stood by his comments on the biology of gender the Press Secretary said: “Yes, you’ve heard him say that before.” Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Conservative PartyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Dovecot, in Middlesbrough, has applied for planning permission to replace disabled car parking spaces nearby with a new summer house. In the meantime owner Carl Blake is looking to extend the beer garden, but is planning to avoid rowdy drinkers using the premises, Teesside Live reported.He said: “We don’t want the social club crowd that wants cheap beer. “Our cheapest pint is £. so we get rid of that type of clientele, we don’t do Carling, we don’t do Fosters. “I don’t want it to come across as it’s going to be a free for all Oktoberfest-style outdoor area because that’s not what we are looking for. “We are expensive, we are premium, everything we do is premium, so we look for that high-end clientele. That’s what we are looking for.  “We would rather have a couple of ladies who have been shopping in the town and stopping in for a bottle of wine rather than a group of lads on a session. “In this area, we have a lot of places where you can go and get sozzled but we don’t have a lot of places where you can go out as a couple and enjoy it.” The plans to avoid some types of drinkers was not appreciated by some people who suggested in the current economic climate businesses can ill afford to pick and choose. One unhappy social media user said: “£. so we get rid of that type of clientele  “Wow! Just wow, grab what you can this day and age pal ‘cause things about to get a lot lot worse.”  Another added: “Disgusting attitude. “This snob deserves to have no customers. I wouldnapost go there even though I could afford to.” Another said: “He says Middlesbrough needs this, then he doesn’t want that clientele. “He does realise Middlesbrough is a working class town and the majority is ‘that clientele’. “I hope he goes bust, the clown.” Mr Blake has also submitted a licensing application to cover the outdoor space and extend the bar’s opening hours on weeknights so that it can hold late-night private s But the owner had been questioning whether he should be ploughing money into the area following a number of recent break-ins. He added: “We have an awful lot of problems at the minute. “It’s dreadful, we have had two break-ins, a car broken into so even though we are spending money on the area, you are still thinking to yourself, am I doing the right thing ” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BeerAlcoholPubs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The bride, groom and best man were all arrested after the bride attacked her own mother at the reception in Bathgate, West Lothian, Scotland. The mayhem began when Claire Goodbrand, , violently attacked and injured her mum Cherry-Ann Lindsay, erupting into a large scuffle where the groom and best man weighed in. New husband Eamonn Goodbrand and his brother Kieran, their best man, joined the fracas, viciously assaulting wedding guest David Boyd and leaving him severely injured, a court has heard. The best man also attacked and injured another guest before police arrived to break-up the brawl.Officers took the wedding party trio away in cuffs and were remanded in custody in separate cells before appearing in court, the Daily Record reports.When they were finally released from custody Claire was wearing what appeared to be her going-away outfit while the groom and best man were dressed in prison-issue Primark tracksuits, still wearing their mud-stained wedding shoes. Professional fighter Eamonn, , who was sporting a head injury when he was freed, gave an address in Uddingston, South Lanarkshire, as did his -year-old we and his -year-old brother. CCTV footage which reportedly captured the fight spilling out of the wedding venue onto the lawn outside, persuaded the trio’s legal team to negotiate guilty pleas to a reduced number of charges at Livingston Sherf Court. Claire Goodbrand pled guilty on indictment to assault to injury but not guilty to a more serious assault to severe injury. She admitted repeatedly seizing her mother by the hair, punching and kicking her on the head and body, causing her to fall to the ground, before striking her head at The Vue wedding venue at Ballencrieff Toll in West Lothian’s Bathgate Hills. She also admitted punching and kicking her mum Cherry-Ann to the head and body whilst she was on the ground, striking her on the head with a shoe and seizing her by the neck and restricting her breathing.  Eamonn and Kieran both pled guilty to repeatedly punching and kicking David Boyd on the head and body while acting together. The charge states that they caused him to fall to the ground and continued their violent attack as he lay there. They admitted pushing their thumbs into Mr Boyd’s eyes, biting him on the head and body and repeatedly seizing him by the neck and restricting his breathing, all to his severe injury. In addition, Kieran Goodbrand admitted assaulting Garry Brown by punching and kicking him on the head and body to his injury at the reception on  June . A fourth member of the family, -year-old Brendan Goodbrand, had his not guilty pleas to two assault charges accepted by the Crown after his alibi that he had left the venue before trouble broke out turned out to be true. Sherf Martin Edington called for criminal justice social work reports on all three accused before passing sentence. He adjourned the case until  April for information on possible disposals, including social work supervision, unpaid hours of work and restriction of liberty by electronic curfew. Eamonn Goodbrand’s Facebook page reveals that he works as a professional fighter, boxing competitively as a light middleweight. It was reported after the wedding reception that one of the alleged victims lost part of a finger during the attack. The prosecution will narrate the full circumstances when the case calls for sentence.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON CCTVWeddingsCCTV footageCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid said that tests will no longer be free for the vast majority of the British public, meaning they will have to paythey want to test under the new plans.But the government announced today that a small number of groups will be able to still access the tests for free. Evensomeone is symptomatic they will no longer be told to test, instead urged to isolate until the symptoms pass. From April , the tests are being massively scaled back as apart of the final stage of the government’s plan to live with Covid. However, some people will still have access even after universal testing ends.  On top of this, the government did specy thata new iant of concern emerges then it could be expanded once more. After Friday, the groups who will still have access to free lateral flow tests, when they are asymptomatic, are: • Patient-facing staff in the NHS and NHS-commissioned healthcare providers • Staff in hospices and adult social care services • A small number of care home visitors who provide personal care • Staff in some prisons and places of detention • Staff in high-risk domestic abuse refuges and homelessness settingsThen, for people who have symptoms, more groups will still have access to testing whilst symptomatic. This will include: • Certain hospital patients who need access to treatments and ongoing clinical surveillance for new iants. • People who are otherwise eligible for community Covid treatments as they are more vulnerable,• And people discharged from hospitals into care homes and similar settings.During an outbreak accessibility to asymptomatic testing will be expanded further. This will go on to include residential special needs and disability schools, and care home staff and residents. Whilst the above will have access to tests when asymptomatic, there are plans in place to make sure free tests are available for some with Covid symptoms. From now on, people who have symptoms, instead of testing, should try to stay home and avoid contact with other people until any symptoms pass. This includes school children.  Mr Javid said: Thanks to our plan to tackle COVID, we are leading the way in learning to live with the virus. We have made enormous progress but will keep the ability to respond to future threats including potential iants. Vaccines remain our best defence and we are now offering spring boosters to the elderly, care home residents and the most vulnerable - please come forward to protect yourself, your family, and your community. One of the reasons the government withdrew the testing programme, as well as believing the country had progressed past the need for such surveillance, was due to the heavy costs. The government said free testing, tracing and isolation cost more than £. billion over the past two years.

But his family say it was a fight which caused his deathNathan Hole died days before he was due to become a father for a fourth time Image: Kayleigh Rosevear WSByChris MatthewsRyan MerrieldReporter:,  Mar  The grieving family of a dad-to-be who died on a night out days before his baby was born have challenged the findings of his inquest.Nathan Hole, of Camborne, Cornwall, suffered a cardiac arrest at a friendaposs house hours after drinking heavily and taking cocaine.Senior coroner Andrew Cox ruled the -year-oldaposs death was drug-related after a postmortem put his passing down to the toxic effects of the class A substance, reports CornwallLive. However, Nathanaposs mum Rebecca Reynolds, a nurse, told the court in Truro she had evidence he was ambushed while walking back from a bar and thugs jumped on his head. She said she felt let down by the police, who had initially treated the death as murder, with two people arrested and later released. Thermal engineer Nathan, who had three other children, had been involved in a series of fights while out with friends at the townaposs Cafe Sol bar, the court heard. At one stage, at around pm on the night in question in July , a man threw a glass and he and Nathan exchanged several punches. Nathan was thrown into some bin bags before the pair were separated and both left the scene. During that fight he was described as unsteady on his feet but highly agitated and bouncing on his feet, at the hearing.  A pathologist’s report found no evidence to suggest any such physical altercation may have resulted in Nathanaposs death. After the scuffle he had gone to the house of friend Darren Lazenby in Cross Street where he was said to be highly agitated and banged his head on the landing. Shortly after, he began fitting, and other people at the house called the emergency services. Ms Reynolds said during the delay between him leaving the fight and arriving at the property, she believes he was jumped by two men. PC Thomas Kerr described how police and paramedics were called to the address where they encountered a chaotic scene with lots of people and furniture in the way. Nathan was pronounced dead at the scene. Also giving evidence was Nathan’s partner of  years, Kayleigh Rosevear. She said he only drank and took drugs recreationally, adding: He knew how to have a good time. Miss Rosevear said that Nathan twice called her in the hours before his death and was loving, soppy and “his usual self”. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information at www.mirror email During her evidence, Ms Reynolds, said: “We have evidence he didn’t go straight to the flat and was jumped on by two men, standing on his head. “The boys he was with gave totally dferent stories that night. I feel Nathan hasn’t had full justice. He was just . A lot of people take drugs in Camborne and don’t die like that. He was a healthy boy. Why did they take so long to call an ambulance and leave my son to die ” Ms Reynolds claimed other people present were more concerned with hiding drugs before the emergency services were called. Mr Cox reminded Ms Reynolds that experts’ reports had shown there was no link between Nathan’s death and the violence that night. In a statement, Mr Lazenby said his long-time pal Nathan had been taking cocaine on and off for a few days and that they had done several lines together outside Cafe Sol. Regarding the fight, Mr Lazenby said it was like handbags. The statement also said he didnapost know where Nathan went between the fight and him receiving a call saying he was having a seizure at his house. Concluding the inquest, Mr Cox said Nathan was too young to die. He said Nathan had had plenty to drink and was taking regular amounts of cocaine, and got involved in at least one or two fights on the night he died. The coroner said at the Cross Street flat he was agitated and swearing profusely, banging his head several times. He added that a police investigation found a lack of evidence supporting claims anyone  was involved in his death.

The downed bomber has been identied as a Short Stirling MK, specically listed as the Short Stirling BF aeroplane - as each inidual aircraft came with its own designation during the war.The British WWII bomber Short Stirling is believed to have been shot down by a German night fighter on December ,  - killing all eight crew members. Short Stirlings were British bombers used in the war against Nazi Germany before the aircraft was relegated to second-line supplier duties in late . The wreckage was found on a beach in Camperduin, a small village in the Dutch province of North Holland in February. But it has only now been identied as a % British wartime bomber.  Martijn Visser of the Egmond Foundation apos-apos, which is based at the Bunkermuseum Jansje Schong, in the village of Egmond aan Zee, on the North Sea coast, in the Dutch province of North Holland, said that after careful checks, he was now % certain that it is a British plane. He added: Often small pieces wash ashore, but such a large part as now is really unique. The -year-old, whose day job is working as an electrician and running his own company, said: On the wreckage pictures you can see A.M., which stands for aposAir Ministryapos, this was used during WWII on aircraft parts. The Air Ministry was a British Government department that oversaw the Royal Air Force from between  and .Visser said: We came into possession of some Dutch and German documents which mentioned the crash of a Short Stirling into the sea in the vicinity of Camperduin. We compared our wreckage with the only remaining fuselage of a Short Stirling in the Netherlands and it was a % match. The expert researched the aircraft wreckage and came across the Dutch airbase of Deelen, where the only remaining hull of a Short Stirling can be seen in its museum. He and other researchers determined that the remains of the wrecked British bombers came from the same type of combat aircraft. Visser said: A total of three Stirlings crashed off our coast, two near Bergen aan Zee and one near Camperduin. We are % sure that the wreckage came from the latter.  He said of the plane that crashed so near to safety: They were almost home. Visser added: By the time you reached the Dutch coast, you were pretty safe. He said: They named the area between Castricum and Egmond aan Zee aposthe gapapos because there was little anti-aircraft artillery there.”  Short Stirlings were used for mining German ports before being used as a supplier craft during the Allied invasion of Europe in -. The Allied invasion saw the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Free French Forcesfirst invade Italy, after defeating the Nazis in North Africa, before landing in Normandy on June , , in what has come to be known as the D-Day landings, officially called Operation Overlord.

Leboat volunteers, coastguard officers and members of the public raced to save the vehicle.

Llandudnoaposs inshore leboat Dr Barbara Saunderson was taken away from a training exercise in Llandudno Bay when the alarm was raised. The leboat team was called in to assist the coastguard after the vehicle became submerged in the water due to the tide.  The vehicle was at Porth Eirias, Colwyn Bay, when the tide came in. The incoming tide submerged the car despite the best efforts from the leboat crew and the coastguard team. RNLI crew member Luke Heritage said: Regrettably we could not achieve a recovery but did leave a marker buoy as a navigational aid for a submerged hazard.

She was given fertility drugs, but it took her a further  months to fall pregnant. Alana, , of Essex, is now expecting her first child with fiancée Jack Costin, . She said: I started taking the pill because I was bleeding for three weeks every cycle and was getting anaemic. It suppressed my periods and seemed like a good solution at the time. I had no idea it would take so long for them to come back once I stopped taking the pill, or that it would be another two years before I managed to have a healthy pregnancy.I do want people to remember stories like mine are very uncommon, and things like this typically donapost happen. A lot of the time, birth control isnapost the root cause of the problem, but it can make pre-existing problems that you are unaware of so much worse and harder to manage.  Alana now urges people to do research in case they could be negatively affected. She said: Make sure you do a lot of your own research - donapost just go with the first thing suggested to you. Go with the option that feels right for you, and remember you can always change your mind once youaposve started. Alana, who works in marketing, started taking the pill when she was  following a year of abnormal periods.She came off it five years later in  because she thought it was impacted her mental health. When Alana was  she knew she wasnapost ready to have a child, but knew she wanted to be a mum one day. She grew concerned when her periods had not come back. In January , she saw a doctor after not having her period for two years. Alana was diagnosed with Pill-Induced PCOS and was given metformin, inositol supplementsand a week course of norethisterone to induce a period. In October , she fell pregnant but sadly miscarried.After further treatment, Alana fell pregnant on New Yearaposs Eve in . Now, she is four months pregnant and scans show her unborn baby is in good health. Alana added: I feel immensely blessed and grateful to be pregnant because at times it never felt like we would get to this point. However, Iaposve mostly been anxious. Going through infertility and pregnancy loss meant that when I did fall pregnant, I assumed things would eventually go wrong. In early pregnancy, I would take a test pretty much every single day and compare the line to the day before to check it was getting darker.

This pregnancy has gone perfectly and I havenapost had a single complication or any reason to worry, but the anxiety never goes away. But I am excited to welcome this child.

But her warmth appeared not to be shared by other royals, said body language expert Judi James, who claimed that they “pretended to not even see him”.Only Prince Harry and Meghan Markle of the senior royals were not at the service that were attended also by friends and people who benefitted from his charities and patronages. With around , people attending the thanksgiving event it was a very dferent scene to Philip’s funeral last year that was held with minimal mourners due to Covid restrictions. Andrew took his seat next to Edward in the front row at the church after escorting the Queen.Ms James told the Daily Mail: “Taking his place next to Edward he cut an isolated but defiant-looking figure, but there were no glances or even nods of greeting and no discernible eye contact. The eye-avoidance looked deliberate, with most of the Firm staring pointedly ahead as though barely even aware of him.”She pointed out how Edward and Sophie have been used by the Royal Family as buffers on other occasions but there was no “warmth” this time.  And she honed in on the closeness of the relationship that the Queen has with Andrew. The message from the Queen about her prodigal son Andrew looked unequivocal today. As her eldest son Charles is fond of saying, this is now clearly a aposnon-negotiableapos relationship, said Ms James. Not only did she choose her second son to accompany and support her as she walked into the Abbey, making this the first time she has been seen in public accepting assistance from anyone, she also paused before they parted to take their seats and threw him a smile of thanks in front of UK and foreign royalty as well as the eyes of the rest of the world. The body language expert also felt that there was a non-verbal arrogance from Andrew which she picked up by the wave that he gave to photographers. Andrewaposs bearing was upright and almost military. Those spectacles perched on the end of his nose suggested his tendency to non-verbal arrogance is still holding firm, while his wave to the cameras could be seen as something of a victory role, Ms James added.

He has let the Queen down once again, says Polly HudsonThe Duke of York, right, with his late father Prince Philip and mother Queen Elizabeth Image: Getty ImagesopinionByPolly Hudson:,  Mar |comments It doesn’t feel that controversial an opinion to say that I never want to see Prince Andrew again.Hard not to assume that most people feel the same way. So it seems impossible that Andrew, and those around him, aren’t aware of that. They must know exactly how popular he is, and that there is nothing that will ever change that.Of course Andrew is entitled to go to a memorial service for his father – but it is utterly tone deaf of him not to have read the room. He clearly should have slipped into the building quietly, sat somewhere discreet, tried to be as invisible as possible. To instead arrogantly rock up front and centre stage, even travelling in a car with the star of the show, is appalling behaviour, even by his standards.If his mother needed assistance on the journey, and down the aisle, there are plenty of other family members who could – who should – have been by her side instead.Andrew has let the poor Queen down, yet again, on what was already a testing day for many reasons. He shouldn’t have put her in that position, he should have insisted on travelling alone, being seated separately, definitely not in the front row, of all places.Sitting smugly in the hot seat makes it seem like he doesn’t understand the seriousness of what has happened, the cloud over him that will never go away – or that he simply doesn’t care. In reality it’s hardly a shock that Andrew hasn’t done the right thing –he was man of honour and integrity he would have nothing to apologise for. Which, let’s never forget, he never has. Palace insiders believe that after today he will effectively disappear from public le. Good riddance. Don’t let the palace door hit you on the way out.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgePrince GeorgePrincess CharlottePrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal FamilyThe Queen\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Richard Grfin, who was responsible for the safety of both the Queen and Prince Philip for  years, was a guest at todayaposs event but was disappointed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex decided against ing to the UK to pay their respects.Harry has said heaposs unable toto the UK due to safety concerns, which have become the subject of his latest legal battle - this time against the Home Office. Speaking to Sky News, Richard said: William had a great training from [Prince Philip] and is going to learn all his examples for him. Fingers crossed, I just hope Harry gets some of these things into his mind.Asked about his decision not to attend, he said: That was a big disappointment for everybody. He also said that members of the ,-strong congregation were discussing Harryaposs absence before the service began. He said: Certainly around where I was they thought he should have been here. All this nonsense about he couldnapost get protection, as far as Iaposm concerned that was a pathetic excuse, he should have been here to honour his grandfather. At the end of the day,he was that worried about security he could have stuck with his brother and father who have got wonderful security. He would have been more than safe.Richard worked for the royal family for over a decade and said todayaposs service captured the Duke perfectly. Speaking about todayaposs event, he said: To see the Queen come in and sit with her family, that was wonderful.It was very emotional. I worked with Prince Philip for  years and travelled the world with him, I did a lot of things with him and deeply missed him when he died.Prince Philip had a big footprint on the service, you could see it right the way through. It was fantastic to be able to come today and pay our respects. It was a wonderful, wonderful service. He was the most caring man you could possibly meet.  He also shared a story about when his son was diagnosed with cancer and Philip called the hospital to check on him. He also wrote to his we to check on her and on another occassion arranged transport so Mr Grfinaposs daughter could make it home Christmas. Todayaposs event paid tribute to Prince Philipaposs charity work and decades of service to the Queen and the royal family. The Dean of Westminster delivered a moving speech about the Duke. He said: He would hate to think that I should paint a picture of him as a ‘plaster saint’ someone without the usual human foibles and failings. He was far too self-aware ever to be taken in by flattery. Of course, it must be said that his le bore the marks of sacrice and service.  Certainly, he could show great sympathy and kindness. There is no doubt that he had a delightfully engaging, and often self-deprecating, sense of humour. It is quite clear that his mind held together both speculation and common sense. Moreover, nobody would ever doubt his loyalty and deep devotion to our Queen and to their family. Yet, there were times when he could be abrupt maybe, in robust conversation, forgetting just how intimidating he could be. A kind of natural reserve sometimes made him seem a little distant. He could be somewhat sharp in pricking what he thought to be bubbles of pomposity or sycophancy. On the other hand, we should not forget that he himself was sometimes wounded by being unfairly criticised or misunderstood. Like the rest of us, he was part of flawed humanity. Unlike most of us however, he was one of those rare people who remained true to, and guided by, what you might call ‘an inner spiritual compass’ a sense of being called to play a part in the making of a God-intended world. As we give thanks for the le of a remarkable man, perhaps out greatest tribute to him, most especially in these far too troubled times, will be for us to accept the challenge, implicit in his le, to rekindle in our hearts something of that call, and to prayfor the inspiration and the guidance to play our part, however small, in working for a kinder future.

And an adorable moment was spotted between Charlotte and Beatrice as the congregation sang a hymn earlier today.Footage shows that as Charlotte gazed around the huge building as the congregation sang, the young princess caught the eye of Beatrice behind her. As the pair locked eyes, Beatrice gave an exaggerated smile to Charlotte, who ingave a wide smile back to her dadaposs cousin. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up . After spotting the moment on TV, royal fans took to Twitter to share their delight at the cute moment.One wrote: Aw I have a feeling they have always had a lovely relationship! A pic from Eugenie’s wedding comes to mind. While another said: Looks like Charlotte looks up to her. Bless.However, it wasnapost the only sweet moment Charlotte had at todayaposs ceremony - she also said hello another of the Queenaposs young great granddaughters, Mia Tindall. As Charlotte left the service alongside her parents William and Kate, Zara could be seen pointing out the young princess to Mia, who was sat beside her. And as they passed each other, Mia gave her younger relative a huge wave as they left the service. Charlotte, Mia and their siblings have all been pictured together at events in the past with Prince William seemingly having a close relationship with his cousin Zara. The young royals were led at the service by the Queen, who arrived at Westminster Abbey arm-in-arm with her son Prince Andrew to pay a final tribute to her beloved husband Prince Philip, despite concerns she wouldnapost be able to attend for health reasons. Dressed in a dark green coat, the Queen used a walking stick as she took her seat in the front row of the packed abbey, next to Prince Charles and Camilla. The Queen only made the final decision to attend this morning and special arrangements were put in place for her comfort.

Charlotte, Mia and their siblings have all been pictured together at events in the past with Prince William seemingly having a close relationship with his cousin Zara.However, it wasnapost the only cute moment that Charlotte had at the ceremony today - she was also spotted smiling at her dadaposs cousin Princess Beatrice, who sat behind the Cambridge family in the Abbey.

As Charlotte gazed around the huge building as the congregation sang a hymn, the young princess caught the eye of Beatrice.The pair then exchanged cute smiles before they went back to joining in with the hymn.The young royals were led at the service by the Queen, who arrived at Westminster Abbey arm-in-arm with her son Prince Andrew to pay a final tribute to her beloved husband Prince Philip, despite concerns she wouldnapost be able to attend for health reasons.  Dressed in a dark green coat, the Queen used a walking stick as she took her seat in the front row of the packed abbey, next to Prince Charles and Camilla. The Queen only made the final decision to attend this morning and special arrangements were put in place for her comfort.The service was limited to  minutes and the monarch sat in one of the Canada chairs but with an additional cushion. Among the other royals there were the Earl and Countess of Wessex and their children Lady Louise Windsor and Viscount Severn.Others attending were the Princess Royal and Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, Peter Phillips and his daughters Savannah and Isla.Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, the Duke of Kent and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester made up the rest of the royal attendees.

Buckingham Palace will calculate an elderly monarchaposs above criticism on the day of her dear, dead husbandaposs memorial service. But choosing to be escorted to and from Westminster Abbey by a man who paid a reported £-million to settle a sordid sex case to avoid court was deeply distasteful. It wasnapost a sweet old maaposam who wanted to travel from Windsor Castle in state limousine with a scoundrel shunned since paying off a woman who alleged when a teenager she was force to sleep with a dad of two old enough to be her own father.  This was an elderly monarch exploiting sympathy at a personal yet very public event to walk back into polite society a reviled man forced to give up even honorary membership of a posh golf club over the scandals spewing from a close friendship with a convicted paedophile and his jailed fixer. What Virginia Giuffre makes of it one can only imagine but much of the watching world, particularly women victims of abuse, will have been revolted. The removal of his military titles and royal patronages, including the use of a His Royal Highness title, look a ersion.  The Duke of York, her favourite son, remains promoted despite stomach-churning behaviour that shouldaposve seen tainted Andrew seated out of sight at the back behind a pillar. Perhaps age and frailty are distorting her judgement because this was a colossal mistake by a declining monarch. She put her son and family before decency, trying to sell a leper to the country at a service commemorating her husband. Knee-bending courtiers will struggle from now on to argue sheaposs principled and does what is right in the service of the country.  She held on to Andrewaposs arm but it was her parading him. He continues to deny the claim but embracing the humiliated sex case settler damaged her own reputation. After the disastrous royal colonial relic tour of the Caribbean, the head of the creaking institution also undermined a family business suddenly feeling very out of date.

She reportedly put a large chunk of her money into a trust fund, to be split between all her great-grandchildren.But the Queen Mother had an agreement that Prince Harry would get more than Prince William.So, when she passed away aged , the brothers had £million to split between them, but as agreed the younger brother did better out of the deal.  The logic behind the Queen Motheraposs decision is based on how finances within the royal family work.When the Queen dies and Prince Charles becomes king, William will likely become the new Prince of Wales.This means he will inherit the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate that funds the public, charitable and private activities of the heir to the throne. Harry, on the other hand, wonapost get any of this.

Diana left her boys £,, which was reduced to £,, after death duties.

Many items from the Queenaposs private art collection were given to the royal collection and went on display at Buckingham Palace.

Kyra Leanne King lost her le in the car park area of Ostler’s Plantation, a wooded area near Woodhall Spa, Lincs, at .pm on  March.Two people were arrested following the death, but they have been released under investigation, Lincolnshire Live reported. Assistant Coroner for Lincolnshire Paul Cooper today opened the inquest into Kyraaposs death during a short hearing at the Myle Cross Centre in Lincoln. Lincolnshire Police Detective Chief Superintendent Andy Cox previously said: “This is an exceptionally sad incident, and one that we know will impact the local community, or indeed anyone hearing about it. “There may be a temptation to speculate about what happened while people attempt to understand this tragedy, and we’d ask people to avoid doing so, particularly on social media where facts can become distorted.  We will do everything we can to establish what has happened, and we’d like to thank everyone for their support.” The inquest heard evidence from Coroneraposs Officer Jackie Foxlow who confirmed that East Midlands Ambulance Service were called to Ostleraposs Plantation. A preliminary postmortem carried out by Forensic Pathologist Dr Stuart Hamilton at Leicester Royal Infirmary recorded the provisional cause of death as head and neck injuries. The inquest opening also heard evidence from temporary Detective Inspector Cally Murray, who told the hearing it remained a live investigation and enquiries into the circumstances are continuing while two people remain under investigation. The officer said the child died after sustaining injuries from a dog attack, but added that investigators were keeping an open mind about the incident generally. Lincolnshire Police will be seeking a destruction order against the dog, which has been seized and remains in kennels, once active proceedings are completed, the inquest heard. Assistant Coroner Cooper adjourned the inquest to a date to be fixed and said it could take some months for enquiries to be completed.  Assistant Coroner Cooper said: This is a sad case. There is a grieving family out there. Any social media comments could be hurtful. The breed of dog involved in the incident, which happened in the car park area of Ostler’s Plantation, was not disclosed during the hearing, but Lincolnshire Police have previously said they believed it to be a Husky. Officers launched an investigation into the death and previously arrested a -year-old woman and a -year-old man on suspicion of being in charge of a dog which was out of control. They were later released under investigation.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Lincolnshire PoliceDangerous dogsInquests\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Tragedy struck in January  when the -year-old came to visit him in Eccles, Manchester, as she crossed a road and was hit by two cars. The drivers of the vehicles said Selena was looking to her right, as she would to cross safely in the US, but traffic drives on the other side of the road in Britain, Manchester Evening News reported.As a result she was hit by a Skoda, followed by a Renault Clio, the court heard. The Clio driver told proceedings: “She seemed to be looking the wrong way.  This made sense when I found out she was American. I know this because Iaposve done it myself when Iaposve been abroad - looking in the wrong direction for traffic. The Clio driver and her front-seat passenger told the inquest they simply did not see Selena as she was crossing the road, which has lighting on only one side. As a result, the driver did not brake with black box data fitted for her insurance company and retrieved from her car revealing she was driving mph when tragedy struck.  Stephen said the couple met talking in internet chatrooms in  after being introduced by a friend. He said: We used to speak on a regular basis and talked every other day. Over a period of time there was a mutual attraction, even though we hadnapost met physically. “This increased over time and the conversations would grow and we could talk about anything. “In  I asked her to be my girlfriend and I was overjoyed when she said yes. In July , Stephen visited Selena in Tennessee and met her grandparents, Donald and Florence Lee. He added: The time we spent together was magical.”  A statement previously released on behalf of the family said: My first beautul daughter, quiet, sweet and loving - a good daughter. She was an artist with an empathetic and kind soul, always creating, singing, painting and a writer of books and poetry. She always did charity work and was a loyal friend to Elizabeth Grogan - they were the best of friends through thick and thin all the years of her le. She lived with and was cared for by her great grandparents, Donald and Florence Lee up until she became a young lady. Her name Selena meant Moon Goddess - Mystara meant my stars.

Maria Sylvia said she first noticed the dark brown mark ten years ago - but thought nothing of it, as she was in and out of doctors all the time due to being an athlete.The Tik Toker - who has more than , followers - shared the news online after finding out it had probably been cancerous for the last three years. Doctors tol her it was subungual melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer that takes hold in the skin under your nails She said on her page @invrfoundwaldo : No one really noticed it until one time a doctor did notice it. This was probably circa , and they were like, aposoh, thataposs oddapos. But you donapost really fit the demographics. Maria, from the US, was offered surgery in which doctors removed her nail and part of the bone. She said: “Melanoma can sit in a stage called in situ, which is kind of like stage zero, for up to  years. “So itaposs very likely that this has just been sitting for  years and itaposs been maybe cancerous for the last three, itaposs kind of hard to tell.” When she woke up she had a cast covering her entire hand and stopped her thumb from moving as it recovered.Mariaaposs thumb was given a skin graft, with doctors taking flesh from her arm. Sheaposs now waiting to see what the final result will look like. He video, which has reached  million people, has left viewers worried about their own similar streaks. Medical advice warns that you should go and see a doctoryou see a change in size, colour, or shape of the nails.

Eoin OaposFaodhagain is a veteran spotter and regularly records sightings via the lochaposs webcam, but he was worried as no one had seen the monster for a while, as the Daily Record reports.He kept his eyes peeled and monitored the webcam day and night, as well as the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register where no official sightings had been recorded for three months.But Eoin, who had his first sighting back in , was watching the webcam live stream last Wednesday afternoon , when he spotted something unexplained. What do you think about the Loch Ness Monster  Let us know in the comments...He explained that it appears to be two objects moving parallel to each other across the middle of the screen. The -year-old shared the video capture of the virtual sightings, which show strange dark shapes moving about on the surface of the loch. When one person commented that the clip could just be of a log or some debris, Eoin responded: The more northerly object takes a sharp turn to the left leaving an unusual wake, you would have to rule out a log or debris, and it is not consistent of a seal to react in such a manner.

Inverness-based Register keeper Gary ­Campbell, who has recorded more than , alleged sightings of mystical Nessie over the past  years, recently stated that the start of the year and the end of winter is usually quiet time for the monster.

But there are some words you just shouldnapost use for a baby name, no matter how trendy they might sound on the surface. One woman on Reddit has revealed her sister has made a terrible choice when it comes to the moniker sheaposs picked out for her daughter - as although itaposs definitely unusual, itaposs also the name of a serious crime. In her post, the woman explained her -year-old sister is set to welcome her first child into the world and recently sat down with her family to tell them what sheaposs decided to call her impending arrival.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.And the name sheaposs picked out  Arson.The woman, from the US, wrote: My sister is having her first baby, and it’s a girl. On Saturday, she and her boyfriend asked my family out to dinner to see them and talk about her baby name. When we got there, we ordered food and then she told us she was planning on naming her daughter Arson. There was a long pause and I finally said aposare you being serious apos She got kind of defensive and just said, aposyeah we like the name and it’s uniqueapos, I replied with aposthat name sucks and youaposre naming her after a felony crimeapos. She got really angry and she and her boyfriend got up and left.  Later that night she sent an angry text to my parents saying they were raising me to be an opinionated brat with no respect, and how my parents should have stuck up for her. My mum says she’s just really hormonal and that’s why she got so upset but said I should apologise. I tried to call her to apologise but it went straight to voicemail and she isn’t responding to any of my texts. Commenters on the Reddit post sided with the woman as they stated that while itaposs usually the choice of the parent to name their child whatever they want to, a line has to be drawn somewhere. One said: Thataposs a terrible name. Someone needed to say something. While another added: Parents need a reality check when theyaposre about to ruin their kidsapos le. I would have reacted the same way. Maybe not the nicest way to say it but naming your kid that isnapost the nicest either. But others said Arson is a name of Arabic origin and has a completely dferent meaning in other cultures. Someone noted: Arson means aposAn attractive personapos and is of Arabic origin. I think it is the typical problem with naming. Words can have dferent meanings. I am not native English or Arabic, but I have definitely encountered the name a few times.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BabiesParentingUmm what \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Movements of planes used by top Kremlin officials show that Putin could be spending some or all of his time at the hideaway near Surgut in western Siberia, it is claimed.His defence minister Sergei Shoigu is believed to be in a bunker near Ufa in the Urals,  miles east of Moscow, said investigative journalist Christo Grozev. Shoigu has been mysteriously absent for several weeks sparking rumours about his health. The theory of his whereabouts is backed by his daughter Ksenia Shoigu, , who was pictured in Ufa for perhaps three days from March . Ms Shoigu visited the Russian city as speculation was re that the defence minister had suffered heart problems. She also abruptly barred public access to her Instagram where she had posed with her baby in the blue and yellow colours of Ukraine.The use of the high security bunkers,confirmed, is alarming and suggests Putin may be preparing to deploy nuclear weapons, and move that would lead to inevitable reprisal. Grozev, who has links to British investigative outlet Bellingcat, said: “I am absolutely sure that Shoigu is in a bunker. “Tracking the movement of his plane, we see very frequent flights to Ufa.  “Knowing that there are also protected bunkers in this region, this gives an obvious answer about his place of residence.” In an interview with Ukraine- channel, he told TV anchor Yevgeny Kiselyov: “This is our very justied version. “I believe in it, and I consider it to be a purely analytical conclusion. “There can’t be any other conclusion. “If the Kremlin’s war strategy assumes a nuclear strike - and it does - as [Dmitry] Peskov [Putin’s spokesman] himself said on CNN a couple of days ago, then there cannot be any other version. “If there is a decision of a potential nuclear strike, they can’t hide the military leadership afterwards. “They have to be hidden beforehand.  “I am absolutely certain he is in a so-called bunker, and by trailing the plane he usually flies, we see very frequent, almost daily flights to Ufa. “Knowing this region has those very protected bunkers this leads us to the obvious conclusion. “ He believed Putin had another bunker where. “Most likely he is where, because we are seeing other flights, and they are more classied than the flight that goes to Ufa. “These are state planes, and they switch off their transponders somewhere around Surgut.”This is Russia ’s oil capital and is some , miles northeast of Moscow.“It looks like the final phase is quite secretive, and most likely there is a more elite bunker there, with the elite of the government.” Previously there have been claims Putin had moved his close relatives to a bunker in the Altai Mountains, some , miles southeast of Surgut and , miles east of Moscow. Grozev also suggested that Russia’s Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, Valery Gerasimov, is operating from a bunker. Coincidentally, the defence minister’s daughter Ksenia Shoigu seems to have been in Ufa for between  and  March. “Today we are in Ufa, on a working visit,” she posted on her Telegram channel on  March. Local newspapers reported that the financier was visiting “at the personal invitation of the head of region on  and  March”. She is president of the Russian Triathlon Federation, and promotes a charity called the Hero League. She visited the Patriot military-patriotic park under construction near Ufa. One theory is that Putin took time out in the pandemic in November or December  when he visited Sarov and laster Tobolsk - which is several hundred miles from Surgut - to inspect emergency bunkers.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 18 2021 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 2 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.It is getting no easier to plan and oversee public works these days.Council staff are to be congratulated for keeping the ious Mid Argyll projects broadly on track in the face of sharply rising costs and many other issues.We now look forward to the ious projects # and the Tarbert Harbour Authority scheme # coming to fruition.The generosity of Argyll folk in responding to the crisis in Ukraine is remarkable, yet not surprising.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll boosts oban ahead of slockavullin final","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA group of five young Mid Argyll rugby players were in action last weekend as part of Oban Lorne under-s in the semi final of the West Youth Shield.The result of the match on Sunday March  didn#t go their way, as opponents East Kilbride ran out  #  winners, but it was a good contest and close game until Oban players sustained a few injuries and East Kilbride scored a couple of breakaway tries.Oban Lorne and the Mid Argyll contingent # Rhys Coffield, Murray MacDonald, Vinnie Buckley, James Campbell and Sorley Self # have had a great season, winning their West under- development league, so there is plenty for the lads to be proud of.If anyone would like to enjoy some rugby this weekend, Mid Argyll under- boys will be playing on Saturday March  in the final of the West Youth Chairman#s Trophy against Kilmarnock RFC at Slockavullin.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

We ran a local action plan to deal with this, resulting in a number of youths being taken home, tobacco and alcohol being confiscated and fixed penalty notices being issued.#In the coming months new CCTV systems are due to be installed in both Hermitage Park and Churchill Square which should act as a deterrent in these two sometimes problematic locations.#Road crime and road safety continues to be the focus of a large part of our operational activity.

The main aim of this speed camera is to positively influence driver behaviour and improve road safety.#Depending on its effectiveness we will hopefully see more being rolled out where in Argyll in the future.#Inspector Heron added: #Our main focus at the moment is planning for the start of the tourist season over the Easter holidays and beyond as we go into the summer months.#The influx of tourists to Loch Lomondside and the surrounding areas places a strain on local infrastructure and our policing demands also increase correspondingly.#We are working with our partners in Argyll and Bute Council and the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park Authority to have plans and contingencies in place to deal with the anticipated demands.#Under the well-known Cowal Open Studios banner, there will be two new opportunities this Easter for visitors to explore the Cowal peninsula and see artists at work.As well as the traditional Cowal Open Studios weekend in September, look out for Cowal Art at Easter, to be held over the weekend of April -, when each studio will be open between am and pm.Keep an eye on the cowalopenstudios website for more details.The ladies of Lochgilphead SWI were earlier this month treated to a fascinating talk and show of the most amazing quilts by Chrystine Livingston.She talked of how her journey into quilting started and quickly developed.

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position. For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted. Returning alongside St Kentigern for further instructions.’There was a lull in the activities while the leboat resumed its operations. They tried again- without success.Then came the news at . hours – ‘St Kentigern Refloated.’The leboat has succeeded in its third attempt, against odds.The St Kentigern then proceeded to Campbeltown under her own power, while the leboat escorted her, but first it took in tow the coaster’s own leboat, which it had earlier lowered over the port side in case of an emergency.The Ardchattern also accompanied the Saint Kentigern to Campbeltown.Meantime, the two remaining ships, Lairdsdale and Brora, seeing their attendance was no longer required, sent a parting signal of good-luck to the coaster and continued on their respective passages to towards the Irish Coast."},{"url":null,"title":"leader march 11 2022 2","story":"So the Scottish Government remains adamant in its decision to ban creelers from the Clyde for the next two months or so.We#re not talking North Sea trawlers here that can go where in the interim.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous. Duplicity#s original meaning in English has to do with a kind of deception in which true feelings or intentions are hidden behind  words or actions.I wouldn’t blame the children of South Sudanthey just gave up.One third are suffering chronic malnutrition.

settings such as places of worship and wedding or funeral ceremonies, however.Nicola Sturgeon said continuing to require facemasks by law for a further two weeks struck a \"sensible balance\" amid signs that the BA. Omicron wave in Scotland is beginning to peak or stabilise.The number of people in hospital with Covid fell from , to , in the past  hours The Covid threat level is expected to be reduced from medium to low during Spring, said the First Minister.Ms Sturgeon said: \"This phased approach strikes a sensible balance between our desire to remove this one remaining legal measure, and the common sense need for continued caution - not least for the sake of the NHS - while this wave of infection subsides.\"I recognize that face coverings are an inconvenience. However, given all the sacrice of the past two years, and in view of the current pressure on the NHS, I believe the vast majority of people will accept that for a further two weeks this is a proportionate precautionary measure while we pass the peak of this latest wave.\"It also provides some further protection to those who are most at risk from the virus.\"Compulsory face coverings have already come to an end in all other parts of the UK, with England - which briefly reintroduced them in December as part of its Plan B response to the Omicron wave - becoming the first to drop the requirement at the end of January.  #COVID infections continued to increase across England, Wales and Scotland in the most recent week, but decreased in Northern Ireland.These high infection levels are driven by the Omicron BA. iant https:t.co zjZZxROXBX pic CSjbiIxM In February, Northern Ireland switched facemasks from law to guidance, but still strongly advises the public to wear them in enclosed public spaces such as shops, bars, restaurants and public transport.Since Monday, people in Wales have no longer been required to wear facemasks in shops and on public transport, but they are still mandatory in health and care settings. The latest surveillance by the Office for National Statistics  indicates that the prevalence of Covid is highest in Scotland - with one in  people infected - despite the ongoing mask law. The next surveillance figures will be released on Friday.Surgical and cotton masks are known to be less effective against the highly transmissible BA. Omicron strain than previous iants, although FFP and FFP masks remain protective. Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish Governments decision to delay the lting of the mask law across the board from Monday was taken to protect the NHS. She said: \"We have taken account of the very high level of infection and the pressure on the NHS, and the fact that face coverings do provide an important layer of protection against transmission of the virus from one person to another.\"However, we are also mindful that the data may now be indicating a peaking of this wave of infection which should hopefully become more pronounced over the next couple of weeks.\"Source: Public Health ScotlandIt comes as weekly data showed a dip in Covid hospital admissions for the first time since the BA.

In the middle of the meeting a man entered from an adjacent officewho made an ill-informed comment about our estimate. After a minutes thought I closed my file and said: “You know what, guys, I’d love the job but I’ll leave you to it and withdraw our offer” to much jaw-dropping.Where was Jim McColl at the point of award of the Scottish ferries  What was his company’s thinking in accepting a contract it had no chance of fulfilling  Perhaps prominently on the bandwagon of delight that a Scottish firm was going to build Scottish ships and now blaming everyone but themselves for this fiasco.There should be an inquiry but all aspects must be looked at, not just the politicians who, historically, have neither the experience nor understanding to award such contracts, which is why there is an audited method of placing them – apparently not followed.Ken Mackay, Glasgow.FAR GREATER SINS IN LONDONPROFESSOR Douglas Pittseems to conveniently overlook, as does perhaps not unsurprisingly most of the western media, that the UK along with the US was a signatory in  to the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances with Russia which prohibited the use of military force against Ukraine \"except in self-defence or otherwise in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations\".While both the US and the UK have indeed provided Ukraine with military training and defensive weaponry, this level of support falls far short of what was clearly expected by the Government of Ukraine, which has repeatedly called for the imposition of a no-fly zone over its country. However, not honouring commitments and responsibilities has regrettably not only become a hallmark of Boris Johnson but of the UK Government, which in spite of hypocritically welcoming propaganda effectively shuns all refugees, even those fleeing the devastation caused by UK weapons delivered by UK-trained armed forces.As for comments by Jane Laxand others disingenuously castigating the Scottish Government over the procurement of two ferries while not commenting on the far greater \"over-spend\" on two aircraft carriersas pertinently highlighted on the same page by Mary Thomas, it should be objectively noted that the UK Government has not only also wasted many more billionsof pounds through deliberate short-cut procurement, via its friends and political allies, of PPE supplies and associated coronavirus services but that this corrupt process was illegal – surely a far greater \"crime\" and worthy of these correspondents insights Stan Grodynski, Longniddry.REMEMBER THE TORIES FERRY FAILUREI COULD have taken Jane Lax’s resignation call to the Scottish Government seriouslyshe had applied the same call to the Westminster Cabinet, interestingly over ferry failings. After all, we all remember the Brexit ferry contract being awarded by the UK Government to Seaborne Freight, a company which did not own a single ferry and a company which had not previously operated ferry services. The UK Government was forced to cancel the contract at a cost in excess of £ million to UK taxpayers.Ms Lax is rightly concerned about the misuse of taxpayers money, something of which the UK Government has made a habit we all remember contracts awarded for unusable PPE products during the early days of the pandemic.She talks about collective responsibility of government at Holyrood, especially within the Cabinet as a whole and notes that to vote against Cabinet decisions is a resignation matter, while avoiding any mention of collective responsibility at Westminster. Only a matter of months ago Conservative MPs rebelled against their Government policy on Covid passports. Collective responsibility is one thing, but when Government policy is only secured with votes from the opposition benches, the Government’s authority to continue in office must come into question.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk.IRONY OF THE COMPARISONSONE of the most common tools used by independence supporters when faced with examples of SNP incompetence at Holyrood is to point at something the Conservatives at Westminster did wrong. So, references to the inability to build a ferry will evoke mentions of HS while a long list of the money wasted on ious projects will lead to an equally long list of similar misuses of public funds by the Tories. The interesting thing is this line of thinking seem to imply that it is OK for the SNP to make these kinds of mistakes because the Conservatives make them too. Alternatively, these mistakes are only unacceptable when it is the Conservatives or Westminster making them.This is especially ironic when one considers the other frequent argument of the SNP and its supporters: comparing Scotland to [insert country with a similar population or smaller here]. They never seem to want to compare the situation with Scottish ferries with the Denmark ferry service or compare the education systems of Scotland and Norway. I may be missing something but I thought the point of independence was that the Scottish Government was more competent than the UK one, not competing for second-last place.John Shanks, Glasgow.BE PREPARED FOR THE STATUS QUOIT would seem not even proportionally Watergate-level events in Scottish politics are shting support for the parties presently in power and making very bad decisions that affect us all. With this level of apathy and a diehard, sheep-like support, it looks like a long period of as you were is in store.The local elections polls appear to be indicating little or no sht. Not that it will make any dference to the outcome of any independence referendum, were one to be imposed on the majority who resolutely have indicated they do not want it and whose support appears to be increasing. This is the one occasion where those opposing the nationalists show a united front. The nationalist side will lose it, whatever the case.Methinks those at present running the coalition are more than aware of this and wish to spin the present state out as long as possible, ferry and other fiascos notwithstanding. They are guaranteed eye-watering salaries and expenses and constant exposure and very little or no media criticism. Who would want to give all that up So, fasten your seat belts for the status quo.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh.SNP SHOULD QUIT AFTER YES WINI WAS interested in Kevin McKenna’s articleas I thought just before the  independence vote that many voters were confusing the cause with the party espousing it. I thought then and still do now that had the SNP vowed on the eve of the vote to disband in the event of a Yes result, Yes would have carried the day.This is a mistake it shouldn’t make twice. Should a Yes vote ever be successful, the purpose of the SNP has been achieved. A popular commission or other democratic means should then be created to resolve all the “how” questions between vote and independence being declared. This would neatly remove all the “how” questions from the debate so the populace can focus on whether they as a people want to run their own affairs or not.Neil Robertson, Aberdeen.Read more: Well never have a fair society while were tied to Westminster"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-time-woke-brigade-left-statues-alone","story":"The statues of Sir John Moore and Sir Colin Campbell in Glasgow were erected because of their valour in the British Army.

The shocking thing is how much it resembles government policy towards Jews fleeing Nazi tyranny in the s.At that time, the Government, conscious of the fact that it wanted Britain to look good on the international stage and aware of public sympathy for German and European Jewry under persecution, attempted to project a caring image whilst terried of giving, as it saw it, a \"green light\" to refugees to come here. Britain did allow the Kindertransport, although the children had to be sponsored so that they would not be a \"burden\", but also sent back Jews who did not have the correct paperwork to Germany, where it was Nazi government policy to send ees to concentration camps.The British Governments own figures are quite startling:  sent back in ,  in ,  in ,  in ,  in ,  in  and  in the first six months of . When a small number of Jews fled by air to Britain after the Germans occupied the autonomous city of Memel in March , those without the necessary papers were put on the next plane back to Europe. The signals given out were clearly designed to discourage Jews from fleeing west, presumably because they had fled Nazi terror without either enough money or time to get the proper papers.The British Cabinet secretly outlined its policy as being to try to get Jews \"eminent in science, technology, art, music etc\". The test for admission was to be \"whether or not the applicant is likely to be an asset to the UK\". Unsuitable candidates were \"persons likely to seek employment, agents and middlemen, minor musicians, commercial artists, the rank and file of doctors, lawyers, dentists\". The British Government held to its secret position all during the s – claims of sympathy for refugees, whilst making it as hard as possible to get here.The British Government, in true hypocritical fashion, and in collusion with other western governments, said one thing publicly and organised another secretly. Indeed, by July , the Foreign Office was questioning the status of fleeing Jews as refugees. One high official claimed that “a great many ... are not in any sense political refugees ... many are quite unsuitable as emigrants and would be a very dficult problembrought here.” This, as Nazi terror towards Jews intensied.What is thoroughly depressing is how similar British Government policy now is to the s.

It shows that materials like copper, silver and gold,we continue to mine those at the current rate we are right now… we might run out of them in less than  years.“The jewellery industry therefore should really be leading the way in showing how we can work with precious metals more frugally, showing how we can recycle and recover precious metals whether from e-waste or recycling older pieces of jewellery.”To make her unique pieces, Sandra works with the chemistry laboratory using a method called hydro-metallurgy. Which essentially uses acid solution to recover precious metals from e-waste by stripping the plastic from products to extract specic metals such as copper or gold.Sandra’s enthusiasm for the science behind these new methods of chemical extraction is evident as she explains why this method of recovering precious metals excites her so much.“I’m able to see effects like I’ve never seen on pieces before,” she says.“I love to see myself as a kind of alchemist, in transforming metals from a solid form of electronic waste into solution and then back again into a solid form.”Public demand is slowly shting, Sandra says, towards sustainable consumer choices, with more people willing to ask the important questions.Gold rolled from a computer circuit She adds: “I would like to see e-waste gold becoming more commonplace within the jewellery industry, and I would like to see the e-waste recovery market in other countries such as India become a more formal process – where local artisans can benefit from the premium they can attract for their work.“If you’re getting married, you don’t want a ring where the gold has come from a conflict region, or somewhere where children have been involved in collecting the materials.“Increasingly people are meeting their partners online, soyour computer or phone was an integral part of your relationship then having engagement or wedding rings that have come from electronic waste might appeal.”www.sandrawilson"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13626334.jpg?type=article-full","title":"spend-48-hours-dundee","story":"Dundee is a city on the rise. Long neglected by tourists in favour of Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland’s fourth-largest city is changing at an incredible rate, I’m here to find outthe food and drink scene is keeping pace.“The VA is just the beginning”, Fiona Gray from Hotel Indigo tells me, and it’s a message I hear throughout my stay in Dundee. As traditional industries declined, new ones have developed and continue to, as Dundee reinvents itself as a city of innovation, culture and design. It’s the city of “Jute, Jam, Journalism – and now Joysticks”. In  Dundee was designated as a UNESCO city of Design for its contributions to art, medical research, comics and video games.The city’s plans for the next few years are bold and exciting. Dundee Esports Arena opens in , in the city that’s offered a degree in computer game design since and launched a dynamic new industry. The , seat venue aims to be the world’s best streaming venue, and will also bring more music and comedy events to Dundee. Eden Project Dundee is also aiming for , the exciting new project will be built on the former Dundee Gasworks and continue the rejuvenation of Dundee’s waterfront – and no doubt sharply increase visitors to the city.The opening of the dynamic VA has made waves in the Scottish art scene, but students, graduates and staff from Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art  Design have long put Dundee on the creative map. Situated in the heart of the DCA, Jute Café Bar is a bright, industrial style space. I choose a seafood platter which claims to be a light option: the heaving plate of crispy tempura squid, smoked salmon and chive brioche toast and gently spiced thai fishcakes tells a dferent but very enjoyable story. It’s a shame the big windows look out on a multi-storey carpark not the river beyond, but there’s plenty more to look at. I nab the seat beside ‘Artie the penguin’ and order a glass of Vinho Verde. I remember it’s a Monday and only just pm, but Artie doesn’t seem to mind.I’m staying at Hotel Indigo Dundee. This stylish hotel is in a converted jute mill and wears its heritage with pride. In the foyer there are lovingly curated mini exhibitions about the old and new Dundee industries, the perfect place to sink into a deep armchair and read a Beano. In the comfortable elegant bedrooms the little nods to the city are plentul – jute coloured curtains, marmalade cushions – and a very welcome jar to take home. Spot the ribbon edging in the room too – mine has a Dundee cake recipe, others have Grand Theft Auto cheat codes – I know which I could make better use of.Strolling around the city centre it’s clear that recent years and changing work patterns have hit local hospitality businesses hard, there are lots of empty units – but the ones that made it through are busy and there’s palpable potential. The pedestrianised areas are perfect for pavement dining. For a cosy café with a studenty feel, try Birchwood Emporium. The coffee is nice and strong and there’s a simple menu with a few interesting twists. The daily curry comes with a red rice, courgette salad and flatbread, and there are a lot of vegetarian and vegan options. A seat by the window was the perfect people-watching spot. I also liked Empire State Coffee. They carry a great range of Wild Hearth Bakery sourdough pastries, and serve up toasted bagels, soup and sandwiches.Near the art college Gallery  brings together authentic Spanish tapas and striking art exhibitions in a sunny stylish space. It’s the perfect place to enjoy a glass of wine, order a few little dishes, and discover new up and coming artists.I keep spotting signs for ‘Peh’, even ‘Peh and Prosecco’. I’m fairly sure it’s a pie, but stop in at Scott Brothers Butchers to check. I’ve come to the right place. The butcher tells me a Scottie’s Peh is a classic Dundee pie – fillings range from classic Scotch or steak and gravy, to mince and baked beans. Scott Brothers have been perfecting their recipes since  and they sell over , a week. I shouldn’t be surprised, it’s Desperate Dan’s hometown after all. I get a quick lesson in ordering pehs and bridies in a Dundee accent too .In the evening we eat at Daisy Tasker, housed in the same former jute mill as Hotel Indigo. Daisy Tasker was a former mill worker who organised the social activities here – she would recognise many of the mill’s remaining original features . It’s a funky well-designed space with comfy booths to spend an evening, dimmer lights would add to the sophistication. House cocktails were on the sweet side but tasty – we opted for a Rhubarb Ginsecco and a Marmalade Cosmo. My beetroot salad was definitely trumped by my dining partner’s delightful Arbroath Smokie risotto. Polenta came with charred sweetcorn and tenderstem broccoli and hazelnuts but was a little style over substance with crunchy radishes confusing the palate. The duck with squash, savoy cabbage and figs was a better choice. The restaurant is a lively stylish spot with well trained and helpful young staff and clear skill in the kitchen. It doesn’t quite follow through on the local links the hotel is so proud of, but with a few tweaks could easily do so. I’d love to see more provenance on the menu, perhaps some Dundee marmalade rather than wee jam packets at breakfast, and I would definitely have chosen more Arbroath Smokie with my perfectly poached eggs over avocado.Ready for a nightcap we head into town, following whispers of asecret bar. We find the door in a dark alleyway and descend the steps to Draffens. This speakeasy style bar is the place for a real cocktail and would be a hit in any capital city. The menu is extensive and original, told through the story of a ’s Draffens department store catalogue. With leather booths, dark green walls and good music, both the drinks and the atmosphere are elegant and self-assured – with a sense of humour too. In the same building but a few floors up there’s sophisticated Italian style The Blue Room which I’llto for an Aperol Spritz next time.In between eating opportunities, and to work up an appetite, I take a hike up Dundee Law and enjoy the better understanding of the landscape the view from here gives. I also visit The McManus Gallery which brings together art and history – there’s a new exhibition bringing an old street to le that’s a lot of fun.  Don’t miss the incredible exhibition of photographs by Joseph McKenzie, a portrait of the changing city from -.For a last late lunch we try Tahini, a family run Lebanese restaurant that people across the city keep recommending. It’s on a quiet street with an unassuming entrance, but the enticing smells that hit as soon as I open the door make any doubt disappear. Be prepared, portions are large so it’s easy to over-order, but you’re unlikely to mind. The fattoush was bright and fresh with plenty of parsley, falafel were crisp and tasty with a garlic and tahini dip, the baba ganoush was deliciously smoky, and an enormous portion of crispy halloumi almost defeated us. The staff were delightful and with helpful recommendations, and surprised us with excellent baklava and figs.I can’t leave Dundee without a visit to iconic Fisher  Donaldson. With branches across Fe and Angus this family run business has been baking sweet treats for over a century and the fudge doughnuts are legendary. The café here is like stepping back in time, in a very good way. Also planned for my next trip is newbie Wrecking Ball Doughnuts, owned by MasterChef winner and chef patron of The Newport Restaurant Jamie Scott. On the same street The Cheesery is a brilliant deli and yes, cheese shop. The food and drink scene in Dundee isn’t perfectly executed, it isn’t fully gentried or Instagram-perfect. It’s friendly. Portions are generous and smiles are genuine, everyone I ask happily recommends their favourite places, and there are no cafés too achingly cool to be comfortable. Dundonians seem proud of their history, of where they’ve come from and where they’re going, and so they should be. The future is exciting – and delicious. Mine’s a peh. "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-facemask-law-indoor-settings-remains-easter-monday","story":"From Easter Monday on April , the mask mandate will be downgraded to guidance for hospitality, retail, public transport, and other indoor settings  - such as hairdressers, gyms, and cinemas - for the first time since summer .The rules will be relaxed earlier, from Monday April , for some other settings such as places of worship and wedding or funeral ceremonies, however.Nicola Sturgeon said continuing to require facemasks by law for a further two weeks struck a \"sensible balance\" amid signs that the BA. Omicron wave in Scotland is beginning to peak or stabilise.The number of people in hospital with Covid fell from , to , in the past  hours The Covid threat level is expected to be reduced from medium to low during Spring, said the First Minister.Ms Sturgeon said: \"This phased approach strikes a sensible balance between our desire to remove this one remaining legal measure, and the common sense need for continued caution - not least for the sake of the NHS - while this wave of infection subsides.\"I recognize that face coverings are an inconvenience.

Omicron strain than previous iants, although FFP and FFP masks remain protective. Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish Governments decision to delay the lting of the mask law across the board from Monday was taken to protect the NHS. She said: \"We have taken account of the very high level of infection and the pressure on the NHS, and the fact that face coverings do provide an important layer of protection against transmission of the virus from one person to another.\"However, we are also mindful that the data may now be indicating a peaking of this wave of infection which should hopefully become more pronounced over the next couple of weeks.\"Source: Public Health ScotlandIt comes as weekly data showed a dip in Covid hospital admissions for the first time since the BA.

This is a man with a clear interest in shting the blame on others when the root cause, ultimately to the delays of these important vessels was the construction under FMEL,\" she said at the Scottish Parliament.Mr McColl has hit out at the finance secretary saying that what she said was defamation.\"They are good at saying things in Parliament, arent they, because they are protected from defamation,\" he said.\"What was said is totally untrue. This issue was not of FMELs making.\"Kate Forbes wasnt there at the time, and was not involved.

This is what they had over them, they were forced to take the contract. That is not us shting the blame.\"\"I thought CMAL were supportive of us, they gave us the order. They knew from day one we couldnt put up a [refund guarantee]. I told the government why. I said we were up against Polish yards, German yards, Turkish yards all of which have government schemes that back their refund guarantees.

He resigned from the government in  over messages he sent to a teenage boy.Mr Bibby has written to the Scottish Parliaments public audit committee to call for Nicola Sturgeon and Derek Mackay to be summoned to give evidence on the ferries fiasco.There have been concerns that Mr McColls assertions could lead to legal challenges from the firms that lost out in the procurement process as it appeared set up to favour Port Glasgow-based Ferguson Marine.The tycoon said to the BBC had he known of the objections from CMAL he would have pulled out.The contract for Glen Sannox and an unnamed vessel known as Hull  was awarded a year after Mr McColl stepped in to rescue Ferguson, the last commercial shipyard on the River Clyde.The first ship was meant to enter service on the Arran route in the summer of  but is not expected to be ready until next year at the earliest - five years late. Hull , destined for an Outer Hebrides route, has gone the same way. The latest estimated cost for both ships is at least around a quarter of a billion pounds, off an original fixed contract price of £m.Mr McColl has previously accused the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of announcing the contract publicly before a price had been agreed and told the Herald last year that the SNP wanted to make political capital out of it.He has also said that he believed he was a \"pawn\" in the Scottish Governments attempts to save the yard and while denying cronyism, that he got the contract due to his connections with previous SNP leader Alex Salmond and that the SNP government favoured the yard, and not him personally.SNP ministers have come under consistent criticism over the awarding of the ships contract after it emerged Ferguson Marine submitted the most expensive bid for the work out of six competing yards, but CMAL the yard the nod because it had the highest specication and quality.Ministers believe they were acting in the public interest in taking control of Ferguson Marine, as it saved the yard from closure, rescued more than  jobs and ensured that the two vessels under construction will be completed."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-say-covid-update-today-face-mask-laws-set-scrapped-scotland","story":"The face mask mandate, which is Scotland’s last remaining Covid law, will remain in place until after Easter but will then be reduced to guidance.The First Minister said that the current wave of BA., also known as Stealth Omicron, has likely peaked, or is peaking according to the latest available data.The announcement comes after Scotland recorded its highest number of new infections yesterday since the start of the pandemic.Here are the key points from Nicola Sturgeon’s Covid update today.The First Minister confirmed the latest coronavirus figures in Scotland during her Covid update this afternoon.In the past  hours, , new cases of Covid- have been reported and  new reported deaths of people who have tested positive in the last  days.A total of  people are in intensive care, with , people in hospital with recently confirmed Covid- overall.,, people have received their first dose of a COVID- vaccination, ,, have received their second dose, and have ,, received a third dose or boosterMs Sturgeon also said that the most recent ONS Covid infection survey - for the week ending  March - indicated that  in  people in Scotland had Covid.It is the highest level of infection so far recorded by this weekly survey.Ms Sturgeon said that the survey “does reflect the impact of the highly infectious BA. subiant of the virus.”However, while new case numbers remain high, they appear to be stabilising.The First Minister added: “Two weeks ago, there were on average just over , new cases being reported each day. One week ago, the average case number was still high, at around , a day.“But over the past week, it has fallen to , a day, which is a % reduction in the past  days, and the reduction is fairly consistent across all age groups.“So that does give us grounds for optimism that this latest wave of infection may now have peaked.”Ms Sturgeon stressed that vaccination continues to provide strong protection against serious illness from the virus.Additional boosters are currently being offered to older people in care homes, and all people aged  and over.People with suppressed immune systems will have appointments for additional boosters scheduled during spring and summer, starting from  April and appointment letters will be issued by post.The vaccination programme for  to  year olds is also underway and children in that age group with specic medical conditions, and those who are household contacts of someone who is immunosuppressed, were already being vaccinated in line with JCVI advice.Vaccination of the wider - year old age group started on  March, and will continue over the coming weeks. Older children are being given appointments first - but families are being invited to get vaccinated together whenever that is possible.A legal requirement to wear face coverings in some indoor settings including shops and trains will remain in Scotland until after Easter.From Easter Monday on April , the mask mandate will be downgraded to guidance for hospitality, retail, public transport, and other indoor settings  - such as hairdressers, gyms, and cinemas - for the first time since summer .The rules will be relaxed earlier, from Monday April , for some other settings such as places of worship and wedding or funeral ceremonies, however.Nicola Sturgeon said continuing to require facemasks by law for a further two weeks struck a \"sensible balance\" amid signs that the BA. Omicron wave in Scotland is beginning to peak or stabilise. "},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"March ,  at : pmAn Orkney-born composer is royally chuffed to have been selected to help mark HM Queen#s Platinum Jubilee.

Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed. Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year.

It was as simple as that.“It was so chaotic on the day of her birth – the day of her death – we just needed answers. vw,vw,px, px\"Rhiannon Davies and Richard Stanton with a copy of the Donna Ockenden Independent Review into Maternity Services at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust “I began to ask questions but we were met with such hostility and bold lies that really forced us to question what was going on, so it became a fight.“There is just something unimaginable when you’re in the depths of the most horrendous grief and you’re just trying to fight to get answers and you’re being met with such appalling treatment.“It’s been a very dficult period of time and it’s felt very, very much like you’re in such a hostile situation, which is challenging and frightening in itself.”Another couple who have led the campaign for safer care are Kayleigh and Colin Grfiths, whose daughter Pippa died in  from a Group B Strep infection. A year later, a coroner ruled her death could have been avoided.Mrs Grfiths told PA: “Just for me, the sight of the report and how thick it is, and how comprehensive it is, I think we want to thank Donna, and her team, and all the families for coming forward.“It’s so important that the learning is taken.“This is -odd pages of harmed families. That’s a disgrace that they haven’t learned when we’ve told them what the issues were.“So it’s really important, and it’s really important that maternity services up and down the country read this and listen to what families have gone through and the impact that’s had on people’s lives.“Donna’s set out very clearly what action needs to be taken to address this.”Ms Davies and Mrs Grfiths shared an emotional embrace following the publication of the Ockenden report on Wednesday.Asked how proud she feels to have come this far, Mrs Grfiths said: “It’s really dficult to comprehend.“We visited Pippa this morning before we came and we said, ‘This is what we’ve done for her.’“It’s just heart-breaking. There’s so many stories, so many families here today.”Mr Grfiths added: “It’s bittersweet. It’s an accomplishment but it didn’t need to happen.“It shouldn’t have happened in the first place.”Ms Davies described the report’s publication as a “huge milestone”.She added: “I feel the scrutiny should be on the report and on its findings. vw,vw,px, px\"Kayleigh Grfiths and Rhiannon Davies were the first two campaigners who initiated the review into maternity care at the trust “The MPs and the Health Secretaryhave made great statements that this will never happen again – that they’re going to oversee the change.“Families are affected in more than just this hospital trust. The learning is for the whole of the NHS services and I really hope the scrutiny stays on and there is momentum behind the actions that Donna has come up with.”Ms Davies continued: “I’m really pleased with the work Donna has done. She has worked relentlessly and tirelessly and really has got to the heart of deep-seated problems.“She’s been really great and bold in calling out this hospital trust for disallowing staff to speak out freely.“She’s called out the regulators and rightly so.“This is the first time I really feel someone has got our back – not just our back, all of the families’ backs.“For so long, I’ve written quite literally thousands of letters, trying to raise awareness of what’s been going on.“So to get to this point is incredible.”Both Ms Davies and Mrs Grfiths spoke of how dficult the past few years have been.“Last night, I couldn’t sleep,” Mrs Grfiths said.“My anxiety was through the roof. I’ve suffered from PTSD .“We’ve had to fight all the way along in this, so to finally be heard by Donna is a great achievement for all families.“But I don’t think we’ve been heard by the trust yet.“That’s the really important thing we need from this – that the trust need to recognise that words aren’t going to be enough.“Once we stop getting stories – which we’ve had right up until today – of poor care in SaTH , we’re not going to be settled that any improvements have been made.”Ms Davies told PA she is doubtful the SaTH will be able to implement the actions set out in the report.She said: “I have to say, of the  local actions, this trust haven’t got the capacity to embed one.“Senior managers, in terms of clinical managers, are all embedded in the toxicity that created this appalling legacy.“They don’t have the willingness, the ability… there’s nothing about them that will create the change that has to happen.“So, as far as I’m concerned, the hospital trust needs to be disbanded. It needs to go the way of Mid Staffs.“It’s just so deeply broken that I don’t think it can be fixed.”Mrs Grfiths added: “There’s so many avoidable deaths that they could have learned from and haven’t.“It’s been one after another, after another, after another.“The similarities when we discuss it with other families… they are just so similar.”Both Ms Davies and Mrs Grfiths say they hope the report will lead to better maternity care across the country.Ms Davies said: “This feels like a baton. The baton was passed to us by the families in Morecambe Bay. It’s been passed forward to the families at Nottingham and East Kent.“Collectively, the weight of required learning is now a gt from all of these affected families to the NHS.“Then there are those in power, on excessive salaries at NHS England and the NHSI , who instead of navel-gazing have to take this.“They have to implement it, they have to scrutinise it and they have to report publicly, through Parliament, on the recommendations and how they are embedded.“I will not accept anything less.”Mrs Grfiths added: “I hope there will be good care for all.“I hope there will be care where it’s OK for mistakes to be made, just as long as they are recognised and then acted upon in the correct process.“It shouldn’t be sat within the trust.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sam-curran-sets-sights-new-zealand-test-series-recovers-injury  \n","story":"Data ed from the Piano meterActive meterExpired callback event.As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Council remains strongly committed to ensuring Mid and East Antrim is an accessible, safe, welcoming and inclusive place for every person living in or visiting the Borough. In , it was awarded the prestigious ‘Autism Impact Award’ for six of its venues in recognition of “going above and beyond” to create accessible and ‘autism-friendly’ environments – including Seven Towers Leisure Centre and The People’s Park. These award accreditations were presented by Autism NI, in partnership with the Northern Health and Social Care Trust .Pamela, Manager of The Fun Factory, commented: “The Fun Factory is very much behind Council’s ambition to be as accessible and inclusive as possible for every person of every age, background and ability living in or visiting our Mid and East Antrim – it’s something we very much strive to achieve in our own business. “We passionately believe that every child deserves the chance to have a fun and enjoyable experience in an environment in which they feel safe and comfortable.

Pic Pacemaker FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueClimate change should be brought into all aspects of our children#s education. Pic PacemakerMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailTwo weeks ago I attended the Youth Environmental Education Congress in Prague. The World Environmental Education Conference has taken place every year since , and this year marked its first youth equivalent.Some  young people from  countries met to discuss how to better integrate climate change into education pathways.We talked about what education should look like in the st century and presented policy recommendations to decision-makers. We also learnt from one another, discussed ongoing projects in our respective countries, and participated in workshops led by academics and policy-makers.The theme of the conference was ‘building bridges’. The question we therefore sought to answer was how to successfully bridge the gap between environmental knowledge and environmental participation.The science behind climate change is well researched and well documented. A signicant proportion of the population already know about this science. However, what we are not seeing is this knowledge or awareness being turned into meaningful environmental action.While our current education systems operate on the basis that ‘knowledge is power’, it is quite clear that knowledge alone is not enough. We cannot continue along this  premise that knowledge alone will drive change.Even when people have environmental knowledge, this does not always translate to pro-environmental behaviour.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up It is therefore not enough to equip people with knowledge. We need to change their behaviour. The role of our education system, then, needs to sht from one of transfer to one of transformation.When people think about integrating environmental education in the curriculum, the following question emerges: How can we do this successfully Naturally, incorporating topics like sustainability and bioersity into subjects like science and geography seems like an appropriate fit. This provides students with a rigorous understanding of the science behind climate change, and with evidence and practical examples to explain what is happening to our planet – and to the people living on it.However, I would argue that it is not enough to simply teach children about the environment. Instead, we need to teach them how to love and care for the environment. We therefore need to see environmental education being mainstreamed and incorporated into a range of subjects, including art, music and English.Linking climate change to multiple subject areas in interesting and innovative ways will not only improve children’s understanding of how climate change relates to society, but it will also empower children to think about climate solutions.From writing poems on climate change to painting natural landscapes, there are multiple ways to integrate environmental education into arts and humanities subjects. By doing this, we move beyond the mere transmission of environmental knowledge. We ‘humanise’ the climate crisis.A recent conversation with an English teacher reminded me of this. She explained how she took students to read Seamus Heaney poetry in the same bogs and peatlands detailed in his work.This made the lessons more memorable for the students, further engaging them in the content of the poetry, but it also invited them to re-connect with the environment surrounding them. They also spoke with the local community, asking them about how the landscape had changed over time, and such community engagement is another way to make education meaningful.The aim of environmental education is therefore not to simply flood children with reams of information on climate change. It is to foster children’s critical thinking and further connect them with the natural world – allowing them to understand that we are not apart from nature: we are a part of nature.One way in which schools can do this is by implementing outdoor learning. Outdoor learning connects students to nature, helping them to develop a duty of care to the environment. Outdoor learning also deconstructs the very notion of ‘learning’, showing us that learning can take place in many dferent settings.While some people may be unsure what to think about outdoor learning – especially in not-so-sunny Northern Ireland – growing research demonstrates how outdoor learning signicantly improves and accelerates children’s learning and development. For example, children’s motor development, co-ordination and balance hugely improve when they learn outdoors.Symptoms of children with Attention Deficit Disorder improve when they are outside, and nature also supports children’s language development, particularly for those learning a second language.Of course, many schools in built-up, urban areas of Belfast may not have easy access to an allotment or a community garden. However, research demonstrates that students’ performance increases even when they see greenery in the classroom. Simply installing window boxes outside the classroom or decorating the room with potted plants are therefore two viable suggestions for schools lacking green space.In many ways, thinking about the role of environmental education opens an interesting conversation about the role of our education systems more broadly. Exam-based learning has meant that education has become more about making people employable rather than making people better citizens. Beyond serving as an instrument for employability, we must also ensure that education fulfils a more purposeful role.If education refuses to change and evolve to meet the social and environmental challenges that students face, the system is not learning itself. Environmental education therefore reminds us of the imperative to educate for change. To educate for the future.Finally, it reminds us that education should empower us and learning should inspire us. These are truths we seem to have forgotten.Most ReadBabel: Firefighters bring Belfast city centre blaze ‘under control’Council probes claim that ‘pro IRA songs’ played in Presbyterian Church grounds in Co AntrimHow Coronation Street actor Charlie Lawson saved the day at BBC broadcaster Emma Vardy’s weddingBelfast restaurant issues ultimatum to culprit who covered worker’s car in ketchupIRA and Sinn Fein spy Denis Donaldson ‘rejected offer of new le from his police handlers’Top VideosPlayVideo: Blaze breaks out on Belfast Hotel bar roofPlaySDLP candidate menaced on the Shankhill road whilst campaigning \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Two arrested in Rathcoole following body discovery at Carrickfergus reservoirLatest Northern IrelandGrant Shapps unveils plan to make PO Ferries ‘fundamentally rethink’ sackingsPolice renew appeal over young girl seen walking alone in early hoursPO Ferries accuses agency of ‘unprecedented rigour’ as Larne ship detained over failed inspectionMan arrested over murder of Michaela McAreavey remanded on theft charge‘Doctor persisted with failure to be transparent over death of nine-year-old’LatestSam Curran sets sights on New Zealand Test series as he recovers from injuryOriginal Ockenden campaigners speak of ‘bittersweet’ milestoneCase for reforming parole system ‘clear and made out’ – RaabSatellite imagery reveals scale of destruction to Ukrainian city of MariupolGrant Shapps unveils plan to make PO Ferries ‘fundamentally rethink’ sackings,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If an application fails to meet those tests, then we must refuse it.“The proposed constitution submitted by Irish Republican Socialist Party did not meet the legal requirements so therefore the application had to be refused.“We will assess it accordingly and take a decision on all aspects of the party’s application in line with the legal requirements.”He added: “We try to process registration applications as soon as possible after they are received.“However, the commission must carefully assess applications against the criteria set out in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act .“Undertaking this process can take some time in order to ensure the commission reaches a fair conclusion within the legislative requirements.”Most ReadBabel: Firefighters bring Belfast city centre blaze ‘under control’Council probes claim that ‘pro IRA songs’ played in Presbyterian Church grounds in Co AntrimHow Coronation Street actor Charlie Lawson saved the day at BBC broadcaster Emma Vardy’s weddingBelfast restaurant issues ultimatum to culprit who covered worker’s car in ketchupIRA and Sinn Fein spy Denis Donaldson ‘rejected offer of new le from his police handlers’Top VideosPlayVideo: Blaze breaks out on Belfast Hotel bar roofPlaySDLP candidate menaced on the Shankhill road whilst campaigning PlayWomanlatest arrest in connection with Carrickfergus reservoir murderLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election SDLP election candidate Paul Doherty says he will not be deterred after being menaced by group of men on Shankill RoadSinn Fein will ‘defend, but not renegotiate’ Good Friday Agreement: O’NeillSDLP leader Colum Eastwood condemns attempts to intimidate candidatesProtocol does not represent the best of both worlds for NI, DUP leader tells NI Chamber of CommerceSam McBrideOpinionDUP gains ground, but overall support drops for ided unionismLatestShrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust boss says services are now safePaul McCartney: Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins was a rock and roll heroAlan Cumming to star as Robert Burns as part of Edinburgh Festival line-upWoman who travelled to territory of so-called IS not ‘prima facie a terrorist’ECB backs Lord Patel to lead Yorkshire forward ahead of pivotal EGM,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is simply not fair on local families.Mr McGrath said a pattern was emerging whereby motorists in Newcastle sped along the Shimna Road from Donard Park and made their way up the Castlewellan Road.He urged police to get to grips with the issue to ensure people who live locally are no longer subjected to such behaviour.Cllr Devlin said the ldquoselfish actions of some drivers were not fair on residents, insisting that she and Mr McGrath will support those affected by the issue any way they can.ldquoWe shall be requesting a speed assessment of the area and asking police to consider monitoring any adverse behaviour, she confirmed.ldquoWe would appeal to local familiesthey do witness any reckless behaviour on the roads that could endanger lives to report it to police so they can gather all the necessary data..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch Camera Club competition in memory of Charlie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Camera Club members welcomed Vitorrio Silvestri, from CPA Camera Club, last Thursday night to judge the entries which had been submitted for the annual Charlie Rutledge Memorial competition.Charlie was a much loved and respected founding member of Ballynahinch Camera Club and his great passion was mono photography.After Charlie passed away in  it was decided to hold a competition each year in his memory and what other genre of photographs could such a competition attract but black and white Vitorrio gave a critique on each image and, in some cases, demonstrated how they could be improved.

The Ballynahinch scheme represents excellent value for money and should have been prioritised during the past two years.Mr Hazzard said more than poundbn of capital resources has been spent by the roads minister and her department during the letime of the current Assembly.ldquoIt is hugely disappointing that a small, yet strategically important scheme, such as the Ballynahinch bypass has been left on the shelf. In light of the economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would have been a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of the local community, said the MP.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWe can only hope now that when the Executive is restored after Mayrsquos election, that the local community can have a minister in place who recognises the value of the Ballynahinch bypass and finally begins construction.Mr Casement said the bypass could help kick-start the economic regeneration of the town and provide the wider South Down tourism economy with a signicant boost. He said it was vital a start date for construction work is confirmed as soon as possible.A key member of Ballynahinchrsquos Regeneration Committee for many years alongside the late Vincent Fullam, Mr Casement has never given up the battle to secure a bypass, which was first mooted in the late s.ldquoThe bypass is included in a list of strategic projects and is effectively ready to proceed. There should be no more delays. The scheme should have been delivered years ago, he declared.ldquoWhile the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, there are many other benefits, including reduced town centre pollution.Mr Casement added: ldquoThe new road scheme will also dissuade drivers from using built-up housing areas and rural roads as unofficial bypasses and, most importantly, help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre. We need to see work starting on the scheme now.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said it was committed to delivering the bypass as part of a plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation, while addressing regional imbalance.He said that ldquofar from being left on the shelf, the scheme was being actively progressed much further by Ms Mallon than any other minister, with development work now substantively complete and statutory approvals finalised in July last year.ldquoThe next stage would involve commencing the procurement of a contractor but progression to procurement and construction is dependent upon the level of funding made available to the Department in future budgets, he explained.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos bid for the - budget included funds to deliver this scheme, however, the absence of an Executive means there is no agreed budget which means that delivery timescales remain uncertain.The spokesman added: ldquoThis is a priority for our Minister who remains frustrated that once again the absence of an Executive is negatively affecting both the people of Northern Ireland and our infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Carryduff landowner helps the environment with trees  ","story":"CARRYDUFF landowner Rosanna Ballentine and her son Iain have received  trees to plant on their farm to help them enhance bioersity and create a habitat for wildle.The trees have been supplied from a partnership between Trees on the Land ndash a charity and not-for-profit project from the Green Economy Foundation ndash and SuperValu and Centra, part of the Musgrave Group.The project is part of a sustainability initiative from the retail brands which recently announced they will plant , trees across Northern Ireland over ten years.Mrs Ballentine welcomed the initiative and the assistance of SuperValu and Centra staff, along with central colleagues from Musgrave NI, who pulled on their wellies and visited the farm to help plant a mix of hawthorn, oak, birch, rowan and hazel trees.She said: ldquoWe are planting a new native hedgerow and a line of trees along the edge of an existing woodland to ide it from an adjoining agricultural grassland.

crowned Bobby Dalzell Cup champions after defeating local rivals Ardglass in the deciding penalty shoot-out at Meadowvale last Thursday.A goal on the stroke of half-time from Ardglass midfielder Stephen Deegan was cancelled out on  minutes by the close range effort of Celtic striker Jordan McCoubrey.The teams refused to be split in extra-time and following the shoot-out mdash which went well into the sudden death stages mdash Blaine Connolly converted the all-important spot kick to gt his Hoopsrsquo side the victory.A large crowd turned out in Drumaness for the St Patrickrsquos Day showpiece between the current first and second-placed sides in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Premier Division.Adding to the pressure of the occasion was the alternating weather conditions, with the teams contesting the final in periods of sunshine as well as wind and rain.Nevertheless, Celtic kicked off the affair with the blustery conditions heavily in favour of their opponents.It didnrsquot take long for the tone of the match to be set as Ardglass defender Caolain OrsquoShea launched a very physical tackle on Hoops striker Jay Gibney.Ardglass enjoyed early momentum with experienced defender Neil Teggart seeing his wind-assisted free kick from his own half trouble Celtic custodian Nathan Curran less than ten minutes in.Celtic remained calm and soon strung their passes together through clever one touch football with eventual man of the match winner Conor Doherty in the thick of these sequences.However, Ardglass remained a threat and came close when Teggart clipped a cross into the danger area, although striker Michael Magee glanced his header wide.Stand-in Celtic captain Shaun Megahey attempted to play a through ball to team-mate Gibney, but on this occasion the Ardglass defence timed the offside trap perfectly.Celtic did come close when Barry Treacyrsquos corner kick was fumbled by Ardglass lsquokeeper, Mark Armstrong, although Hoops defender Paul Brady couldnrsquot dispatch the ball quickly enough before the danger was cleared.OrsquoShea continued his earlier eagerness and picked up a yellow card for a mistimed tackle before his team-mate, Magee, was unfairly clattered at the other end of the pitch, although Teggartrsquos effort flew past the wrong side of the post.Teggart continued to be a problem from set pieces as his free-kick delivery whisked past the head of striker Magee and out of bounds.Moments later, Mageersquos misfortune continued when he was shown a yellow card for expressing his disagreement with referee, Barry Mullan.After initially allowing the match to flow freely, referee Mullan clamped down on his decisions with less than ten minutes to the end of the opening half.Celtic defender Gary Carberry was the latest to enter the book for a late challenge on Ardglass marksman Magee.Despite this hiccup, Celticrsquos Carberry kept himself in contention for the man of the match accolade after he proved pivotal in stopping potential goalscoring chances from the Ardglass opposition on numerous occasions.As the half-time whistle approached, Celtic arms were raised as they appealed for the red card to be shown to Ardglassrsquos OrsquoShea, who may have considered himself lucky to escape an early bath after he was second to the ball.Ardglass launched another attack and it looked asMagee would have a free route to goal. However, Celtic veteran Brady recovered valiantly to prove he still has plenty of miles left in his tank.With the last attack of the half, Ardglass were awarded a corner and they took full advantage of their opportunity. Midfielder, Stephen Deegan, climbed high above the rest to head his effort beyond the outstretched hand of Celtic lsquokeeper Curran to open the scoring.As the second half kicked off it was evident that both sides would refrain from going for broke. A lot of the following ten minutes contained attacks, although both sides lacked a killer instinct and the match was heavily contested in the middle of the pitch.This is where Conor Doherty earned his post-match award for his performance, as he often won the midfield battle.Goal-scorer Deegan picked up a yellow as the weather took yet another turn for the worse.Celtic joint-managers Jason Galbraith and Matthew McKenna made the first of their substitutions as the clock struck the hour mark with Sean McMahon entering the fray in place of Conaill Kerr.Ardglass opted to put  men behind the ball in order to frustrate the opposition and waited patiently for their opportunity to counter-attack.Ardglass made changes of their own in the form of Jordan Finnegan before Celtic made a second substitute with the talented Sean Ferris making his way onto the pitch.Ferris made an immediate impact, adding another string to Celticrsquos bow by spreading inviting passes into his forward line.With just  minutes left of the , these Celtic substitutions came to fruition after the ball found its way to McMahon, who lofted an inviting ball into the Ardglass box which was steered home by the boot of striker McCoubrey.Celtic continued to mix things up as Corey McCartan made his way onto the pitch and gave a good account of himself with his tireless work rate.Despite this period of succession for the Hoops, the remaining minutes of the  played out finely balanced.Ardglass never let their headsand should be commended for their effort as they cancelled out any further attack whilst continuously seeking the crucial next goal.As tempers flared, the final whistle sounded and both teams prepared for extra-time.The highlights of the first half of extra-time came in the form of Celticrsquos Treacy

It is too early to say how he is responding, however we are hopeful that this is going to be a game changer in his recovery.ldquoAlan still has a long road ahead, but he is buoyed by the support from back home and has asked me to pass on his heartfelt thanks along with our own.Mrs McDonald said that aside from organising the funding appeal, her family felt helpless with her son being so far from home and family members not able to visit him.ldquoIt has been another tough week for Alan, as the medical team in Christchurch worked tirelessly to keep him stable with a series of procedures, including plasma exchange as well as regular dialysis. The treatment so far has already taken a toll on his body and, in Alanrsquos case, it is not having the outcome the medics had hoped for, she said.ldquoWersquove found it really dficult watching Alan go through all of this and not being able to be with him.ldquoThe distance between us back home and him in New Zealand feels even greater and we are desperate to see him again.

After a briefto live in the south of England, Pat eventually settled in New Zealand where he spent the rest of his le.Patrsquos landscape photography is stunning and his portraits of local people are without parallel mdash they reveal a strong sense of place, identity and the character of the people.Particularly important is that most of the people have been identied.The photographs were mostly taken in the s and s, but since then the world has changed in many ways. Some of the landscapes may look the same, but buildings have gone, farming le is radically dferent and the fishing industry decimated.Cecil Newman grew up in Belfast, but from a young age enjoyed hiking and youth hostelling. He studied engineering at Queenrsquos University and joined the Royal Engineers during World War II.Whilst working in Berlin after the war to help with the processes of reconstruction, Cecil took some striking photographs of the devastated city. Some of these images were later given to the Berlin City Museum.After the war Cecil ed to work as surveyor for Belfast City Council and later as a planner in the Northern Ireland Civil Service. Amongst the many high-profile projects with which he was involved were the first Newry Area Plan and the Mourne Study. Both these publications included his photographs.During the s he concentrated particularly on aerial photographs. He was a leading member of the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside and Mournes Advisory Council, often giving talks illustrated with his photographs and slides. After his death the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside erected a memorial in his honour at Trassey car park in the Mournes.Photographs taken by him which are now in the Down County Museum collection reflect both his work and passion for the Mournes. An outstanding feature of Cecilrsquos photographs is that they were accompanied by date and Ordnance Survey map grid reference mdash what curator could ask for more The importance of these two photographic collections is that they complement each other, in covering the same geographical area, but taken for dferent purposes and at dferent times.The number of images represented is smaller than the DJ McNeill archive so it was possible for the museumrsquos curatorial staff to catalogue them all and the Museum Photographer to digitise them.What remains to be done is adding the images and full information to the Museumrsquos database and more to the website. There are always more jobs to be carried out on the collection.However, using the images effectively, and in the way the Hudson and Newman families, and indeed all other donors, wished, requires wide knowledge of all the collections by experienced and qualied professional staff working with them on a daily basis.The photographic archive is recognised as one of the most important in Ireland and contains a wide range of images, including daguerrotypes, glass negative plates, lantern slides, black and white and colour film, transparencies as well as digital images.Understanding of all the processes involved in their making is essential to how they are cared for and used.Lesley Simpson is secretary of the Friends of Down County Museum and former Keeper of Collections at the museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Success at Downpatrick  ","story":"PRIOR to Sundayrsquos Randox Ulster National Handicap Chase meeting at Downpatrick Racecourse, manager Richard Lyttle stated that he was looking forward to welcoming racegoers back to the track for the first time in three years.They certainly turned up with car parks filled to capacity, packed enclosures and long tailbacks on the Ballydugan Road prior to the first race.The Randox Ulster National has been the local tracks major race of the year now for many years and the maximum  runners faced the starter for the three mile four furlong race that sees prize money paid right down to the first six past the post.A bit like the big Aintree race, there was plenty of fallers with two coming down at the very first fence and Envoi Pierji then unseating Donegal jockey Conor Orr, who had ridden Screaming Colours to success for Bill Durkan in the Midlands National at Uttoxeter the previous day.Later in the race there was more fallers at the regulation fence.With two fences to be taken the race involved four runners with the  winner Amaulino travelling like the winner under David McGrath.But this combination then faded, eventually finishing fourth for Co Armagh trainer Keith Watson.The eventual winner in the famous J P McManus Silks proved to be Spades Are Trumps, ridden by Cheltenham winning jockey Mark McDonagh, a lb claimer.Finishing second was Agent Born, ridden by Darragh OrsquoKeefe with Peaches and Cream third.Co Meath trainer Gavin Cromwell, who also had success at Cheltenham, saddled the winner and also the third past the post.

They were used as a commercial rabbit warren when John De Courcy arrived and built Dundrum Castle in .The lucrative trade in rabbit pelts continued for centuries afterwards. Rabbits are still common today, although the population was decimated by the myxomatosis disease in the s.The s was also when the National Trust began managing the habitat on behalf of its owners, the Hill family mdash commonly known as the Marquises of Downshire.The Hill family came to the area in the late th century but had lived in Ireland since the late s, when a young army officer named Moyses Hill, originally from Devon, was posted to Carrickfergus garrison in  to command forces sent by Elizabeth I to subdue the rebellious OrsquoNeill clan and colonise Ireland.Moyses ended up staying in Ireland and marrying the sister of a local clan chief. In , he was granted land at Cromlyn, an area which later took his surname and became known as Hillsborough. His descendants then acquired Murlough in  and began using Murlough Farm as their summer residence.They built Murlough House in , which still stands today at the end of Keel Point mdash at the northern end of the beach. While built to have a spectacular sea view, stormy weather kept breaking the windows, so trees were planted around the house in , and the woodland remains to this day.In , the th Marquis of Downshire, Arthur Hill, sold the surrounding land to the National Trust and then sold the house in . The area became Irelandrsquos first nature reserve in  and remains the most extensive dune heath in Ireland .But prior to being sold to the National Trust, Murlough House and the dunes were a hotbed of military activity ndash particularly during WWII. The house was a base for the US Armyrsquos st Armoured Division and the th Tank Destroyer Battalion.They built several firing ranges in the dunes, including, allegedly, a mortar range. Spare bombers and fighters were also hidden there as Murlough Farm had its own landing strip, called lsquo Satellite Landing Groundrsquo .Murlough beach itself was dotted with anti-aircraft and anti-invasion posts mdash whose rotting remnants are still visible today. They were dug-in when a full-scale German invasion was a threat in the early s.They were part of a counter-invasion strategy that centred on slowing or stopping the enemy at certain locations until other forces could be mustered and deployed. This involved constructing a so-called lsquocoastal crustrsquo along beaches and inland lsquostop-linesrsquo along rivers, canals and high ground.With Northern Ireland being prime invasion territory, a coastal crust was set up from Magilligan in the north-west to Newcastle in the south-east, alongside an inland stop-line along the route of the River Bann. Anti-aircraft landing posts, like those at Murlough, were important in preventing aircraft or boats from landing, but another type of defence was the centrepiece of this strategy: pillboxes.When events at Dunkirk in  sparked invasion panic, the Directorate of Fortications and Works at the War Office was created to construct defensive systems around the UKrsquos beaches. The Royal Engineers and civilian contractors erected over , pillboxes by in a matter of days ndash including on eight of Northern Irelandrsquos beaches.Such structures can still be seen at Magilligan, Portrush and Portstewart. County Down also has intact examples in Bangor, Donaghadee and on the Strangford shore between Comber and Newtownards. Beaches at Minerstown and Tyrella also had multiple pillboxes, as did Murlough. They were spaced to have interlocking arcs of fire, so invaders had little unchallenged space in which to land.One of these pillboxes is still visible in Newcastle, on the beach just below the outdoor swimming pool. The remnants of the other are still visible at the northern end of Murlough, next to the inlet that feeds Dundrum Bay. Yet all that is left are large slabs of reinforced concrete as this pillbox was supposedly destroyed in the early days of the Troubles to prevent it being used to attack the nearby Ballykinlar Army Camp.But these remains are now also under attack from erosion. They are gradually being absorbed by the sea. With this stretch of coastline losing five to ten metres of coastline a year, the remnants of the pillbox, originally built at an elevated height in the dunes, is even starting to be submerged at high tide.What was once a reflection of an indominable spirit is now an unassuming pile of rubble used only as a seat for resting walkers ndash most of whom are unaware of its history. Soon, it will be completely forgotten and the only reminder of this stretch of coastlinersquos rich military history will be the occasional washed-up ordnance.Ben Acheson spent seven years deployed to Afghanistan, including stints as Director of NATOrsquos political team and as Political Adviser to the EU Special Representative.

The Rory Best celebration evening aims to raise money for Banbridge RFCs Club for All projectand Cancer Fund for Children.Banbridge RFC President Maynard Sinton said: “As Rory took up mini rugby at Banbridge at the age of six, we’ve considered him one of our own for over  years. Now that he has retired, it feels like the right time to celebrate his achievements and we’re thrilled that he’s given us his support to push forward with our redevelopment plans.”Rory’s chosen charity, Cancer Fund for Children, will also benefit from the event. In September , Rory took on a mammoth challenge to help children across Ireland cope with the impact of cancer diagnosis. He walked  miles from Daisy Lodge, Co Down to the site of Cancer Fund for Children’s new short break centre in Mayo raising over £,, in the process.Rory Best said: “I couldn’t be prouder to work with my home club on this event. “I have had unwavering support from club members and the local community in my rugby career which means so much to me and I am delighted that I can give something back and be involved in a project which will open up opportunities in rugby to many more people from all backgrounds.“It’s an exciting time for the club as it looks to the future and I’m delighted to be able to support such a great cause”.The black-tie event will feature a host of Rory’s former playing colleagues in a series of not-to-be missed QA sessions. They will discuss their time playing with and against him as well as the upcoming Ireland tour of New Zealand and the Rugby World Cup next year. Cancer Fund for Children CEO Phil Alexander commented: “Cancer Fund for Children is proud to call Rory Best our ambassador. “Not only has he waved the flag for childhood cancer he has also raised vital funds that will help ensure children and young people impacted by cancer receive the emotional and therapeutic support they need.” For more information and to purchase a table for the event email [email#protected]——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMajor changes to recycling have already been made in Barry and rural parts of the Vale of Glamorgan, with separate containers used for dferent materials.As a new recycling plant is set to open in Barry later this year, these changes are almost ready to roll out to the eastern parts of the Vale in October.Vale of Glamorgan council, which has the second best recycling rate in Wales, has set out a plan for the next decade on how to increase recycling rates further.Peter King, cabinet member for neighbourhood services and transport, said the Vale’s recycling rates could even be some of the best in Europe.He said: “In – we recorded a recycling performance of . per cent, the second highest performance in Wales, and likely one of the highest performance figures in the UK and maybe even the EU. We have achieved this performance due to our change to source segregated kerbside recycling.“I can’t underestimate or over-exaggerate the herculean efforts of our residents, I really do appreciate that. However, about one third of our residents, those living in Penarth, Dinas and the other eastern Vale areas have not yet benefited from these new recycling arrangements and are still co-mingling their materials.”He was speaking during a cabinet meeting on Monday, March , when council bosses approved a new recycling and waste management business plan. Improving recycling rates forms a major part in the council’s decarbonisation plan, called Project Zero.Barry and western parts of the Vale already separate their recycling, with an orange bag for cardboard a white bag for paper a grey caddy for glass bottles and jars a blue bag for plastic, cans and cartons a green caddy for food waste and a green bag for garden waste.The changes were introduced in rural areas in October  and in Barry in October ..removePenarth and Dinas Powys and eastern parts of the Vale still mix recycling into a blue bag. The changes aim to improve the quality of recyclable materials, which is better for the environment and means the council gets a higher income from selling the material. Mixing recycling together can often mean the material is contaminated and unable to be recycled.A -week public consultation will be held in the summer on the new -year recycling plan, before it gets final approval. The changes will likely be introduced in October in Penarth, Dinas Powys, Llandough and Sully.Pembrokeshire has the highest recycling rate in Wales, with . per cent, and Cardf the lowest, with . per cent.Before the changes can be rolled out, work needs to be finished on a new recycling plant in Barry, as the current one in Cowbridge is at full capacity. The new plant is under construction at the Atlantic Trading Estate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityRichard Stanton and Rhiannon Davies, who have campaigned for years over poor care, lost their daughter Kate hours after her birth in March .Speaking to the PA news agency, Ms Davies said: “All we ever wanted was to understand why Kate died. It was as simple as that.“It was so chaotic on the day of her birth – the day of her death – we just needed answers. vw,vw,px, px\"Rhiannon Davies and Richard Stanton with a copy of the Donna Ockenden Independent Review into Maternity Services at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust “I began to ask questions but we were met with such hostility and bold lies that really forced us to question what was going on, so it became a fight.“There is just something unimaginable when you’re in the depths of the most horrendous grief and you’re just trying to fight to get answers and you’re being met with such appalling treatment.“It’s been a very dficult period of time and it’s felt very, very much like you’re in such a hostile situation, which is challenging and frightening in itself.”Another couple who have led the campaign for safer care are Kayleigh and Colin Grfiths, whose daughter Pippa died in  from a Group B Strep infection. A year later, a coroner ruled her death could have been avoided.Mrs Grfiths told PA: “Just for me, the sight of the report and how thick it is, and how comprehensive it is, I think we want to thank Donna, and her team, and all the families for coming forward.“It’s so important that the learning is taken.“This is -odd pages of harmed families. That’s a disgrace that they haven’t learned when we’ve told them what the issues were.“So it’s really important, and it’s really important that maternity services up and down the country read this and listen to what families have gone through and the impact that’s had on people’s lives..remove“Donna’s set out very clearly what action needs to be taken to address this.”Ms Davies and Mrs Grfiths shared an emotional embrace following the publication of the Ockenden report on Wednesday.Asked how proud she feels to have come this far, Mrs Grfiths said: “It’s really dficult to comprehend.“We visited Pippa this morning before we came and we said, ‘This is what we’ve done for her.’“It’s just heart-breaking. There’s so many stories, so many families here today.”Mr Grfiths added: “It’s bittersweet. It’s an accomplishment but it didn’t need to happen.“It shouldn’t have happened in the first place.”Ms Davies described the report’s publication as a “huge milestone”.She added: “I feel the scrutiny should be on the report and on its findings. vw,vw,px, px\"Kayleigh Grfiths and Rhiannon Davies were the first two campaigners who initiated the review into maternity care at the trust “The MPs and the Health Secretaryhave made great statements that this will never happen again – that they’re going to oversee the change.“Families are affected in more than just this hospital trust. The learning is for the whole of the NHS services and I really hope the scrutiny stays on and there is momentum behind the actions that Donna has come up with.”Ms Davies continued: “I’m really pleased with the work Donna has done. She has worked relentlessly and tirelessly and really has got to the heart of deep-seated problems.“She’s been really great and bold in calling out this hospital trust for disallowing staff to speak out freely.“She’s called out the regulators and rightly so.“This is the first time I really feel someone has got our back – not just our back, all of the families’ backs.“For so long, I’ve written quite literally thousands of letters, trying to raise awareness of what’s been going on.“So to get to this point is incredible.”Both Ms Davies and Mrs Grfiths spoke of how dficult the past few years have been.“Last night, I couldn’t sleep,” Mrs Grfiths said.“My anxiety was through the roof. I’ve suffered from PTSD .“We’ve had to fight all the way along in this, so to finally be heard by Donna is a great achievement for all families.“But I don’t think we’ve been heard by the trust yet.“That’s the really important thing we need from this – that the trust need to recognise that words aren’t going to be enough.“Once we stop getting stories – which we’ve had right up until today – of poor care in SaTH , we’re not going to be settled that any improvements have been made.” vw,vw,px, px\"Rhiannon Davies and Kayleigh Grfiths react following the release of the final report Ms Davies told PA she is doubtful the SaTH will be able to implement the actions set out in the report.She said: “I have to say, of the  local actions, this trust haven’t got the capacity to embed one.“Senior managers, in terms of clinical managers, are all embedded in the toxicity that created this appalling legacy.“They don’t have the willingness, the ability… there’s nothing about them that will create the change that has to happen.“So, as far as I’m concerned, the hospital trust needs to be disbanded. It needs to go the way of Mid Staffs.“It’s just so deeply broken that I don’t think it can be fixed.”Mrs Grfiths added: “There’s so many avoidable deaths that they could have learned from and haven’t.“It’s been one after another, after another, after another.“The similarities when we discuss it with other families… they are just so similar.”Both Ms Davies and Mrs Grfiths say they hope the report will lead to better maternity care across the country.Ms Davies said: “This feels like a baton. The baton was passed to us by the families in Morecambe Bay. It’s been passed forward to the families at Nottingham and East Kent.“Collectively, the weight of required learning is now a gt from all of these affected families to the NHS.“Then there are those in power, on excessive salaries at NHS England and the NHSI , who instead of navel-gazing have to take this.“They have to implement it, they have to scrutinise it and they have to report publicly, through Parliament, on the recommendations and how they are embedded.“I will not accept anything less.”Mrs Grfiths added: “I hope there will be good care for all.“I hope there will be care where it’s OK for mistakes to be made, just as long as they are recognised and then acted upon in the correct process.“It shouldn’t be sat within the trust.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Original Ockenden campaigners speak of  ubittersweet u milestone article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Southgate was at pains to play down the expectation after the teenager’s consummate performance against Ivory Coast in his fourth senior England start. But he has been wowing the Bundesliga for close to two seasons now and England team-mate Jack Grealish described his ability as “scary” after the Wembley win.

His temperament has enabled him to make correct decisions and flourish when others might have frozen. Comparisons to Steven Gerrard do not appear misguided. At ft, Bellingham, is a well-balanced athlete, a tireless runner on and off the ball, and technically supreme. His all-round game against Ivory Coast left England fans wonderingthere was anything he cannot do.Does he have any weaknesses \"Proud to play for England every single time.\" ❤️A word from your @bt_uk Player of the Match – @BellinghamJude! pic xhWuUcgzO— EnglandMarch , He did not show any at Wembley on Tuesday night. He was a constant threat driving forward, hit the post with one shot, went close with another and saw one run lead to an over-turned penalty. He does have a tenacious edge though and in the Bundesliga has shown his emotions can get the better of him.

The broadband support package will be available to eligible jobseekers through the Department for Communities’ Adviser Discretion Fund, a grant fund available to help remove barriers to employment that prevent people moving towards and into employment Minister Hargey said: “Digital exclusion has been one of the inequalities thrown into sharper focus by the Covid- pandemic. “More than ever, employers are posting vacancies online, with many having moved to online interviewing and more positions requiring people to work from home. “Therefore, not having access to broadband can be a signicant barrier to searching for, or moving into, employment. “I am tackling this by providing free broadband support which will provide broadband for eligible jobseekers who do not currently have the service.” Support for broadband through the Adviser Discretion Fund is available for a period of six months. The Fund can provide a non-repayable grant of up to pound,, in a  month period, to remove barriers to employment. The Minister continued: “The success of the Adviser Discretion Fund in helping remove barriers to employment has already been seen throughout the year, particularly in the uptake of upfront childcare costs, which I made available last October. “I am delighted that we have already helped around  parents with average upfront childcare costs of approximately pound. “This additional scheme will help remove similar barriers to employment for those facing digital exclusion due to a lack of broadband service.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_adfadfbddeceabecf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_deabefcd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1613125631842.jpg--booster_third_dose_milestone_welcomed.jpg?161312563100","title":"booster third dose milestone welcomed ","story":"The number of COVID- vaccine boosters and third doses administered in Northern Ireland has passed the one million mark. The milestone has been welcomed by Patricia Donnelly, head of Northern Ireland’s vaccination programme. She said: “GPs, community pharmacists and Trusts have all worked extremely hard to roll out the booster campaign, with the period in the run up to Christmas particularly busy. “They all deserve our heartfelt thanks. Because of the vaccines, we now have much greater protection against the virus. “All those involved in the vaccination programme are genuine history makers.” Booster doses have been provided from the latter stages of last year, supplementing the two primary doses already received. At the same time, a third primary dose was offered to people with a severely weakened immune system, which was then followed by a booster three months after their third primary dose. The latest tallies on Northern Ireland’s vaccination dashboard include , boosters and , third doses. Patriciacontinued: “While demand for vaccines is no longer at levels from the peak of the campaign, people are still coming forward on a daily basis for boosters and first and second doses. “It’s still not too late to get these jabs. Please do so - and benefit from the really important protection they bring.” The one million landmark has been reached with the Spring booster campaign imminent. In line with UK-wide guidance set by the JCVI, the Spring campaign will offer an additional booster dose to: anyone who is aged  or over care home residents and anyone aged  and over who has a severely weakened immune system.
