Tom Jenkins has been taking an enforced break from action photography and pursuing a different kind of vision in his gardenI have never appreciated my back garden so much.At this time of year, I’m usually caught up with all the to-ings and fro-ings of the sporting world: taking photos of traditional spring events like the Boat Race and Grand National, or key matches as the football season builds to a crescendo. Normally I’m away a lot, not really passing an eye over developments in my garden. But this is not a normal year.It was mid-March, and I was sitting despondently in my tiny postage stamp of a garden. The previous week I had photographed the Cheltenham festival, an event I associate with the end of winter, spring coming, the light getting better. A chance to look ahead to a summer of sport, going to events that I love. But this year, the festival had felt all wrong – more like a dangerous party on the eve of war. It seemed all around me the news was harrowing, and sport was getting hammered as event after event was cancelled. My world had suddenly been turned upside-down.I realised then that I had to reframe and refocus. With all my normal avenues for taking pictures closed off, I needed to find something else. I recalled the words of Ed Jackson, a former professional rugby player whose portrait I had taken exactly a year earlier. After suffering an awful accident that had left him partially paralysed, he had developed a mental process to cope with his new situation: focus on what’s in front of you, focus on things you can affect, and try to forget what’s out of your control.Remembering this, I looked round the edge of the tiny piece of lawn and noticed some tulip bulbs that my wife had planted in terracotta pots. Lush green leaves with buds full of promise had emerged from the soil, ready to bloom. In these plants, I saw hope. I saw normality.It occurred to me then that this process of growth and positivity deserved to be documented. Despite the global madness, nature was thriving – and these tulips seemed to be begging me to tell their story. To me, photography is more than just a career: it is my passion, and in these flowers I found the perfect opportunity to take pictures without leaving my home.To test myself, I decided not to use any of my main professional cameras. These are more used to the hurly-burly of sport, all fast focusing and speedy motor-drive. Instead, I turned to what I call my “holiday camera”, an upmarket point-and-shoot that I take away on trips with the family (the last thing I want on holiday is to be surrounded by items associated with work, many of which are heavy). Light, easy to manoeuvre around the plants, and – most crucially – able to focus close-up, this small camera actually turned out to be perfect for this project.As the sun moved round the garden during the day, backgrounds became dark and shadows on the flowers created gorgeous patterns. I would note which times were best to photograph certain plants, and would periodically drop whichever household task I was doing (much to the irritation of my family) to race to the garden and catch the flowers in the perfect light.Like all photographers, I look to light as another tool in the box, an opportunity to create something different. By varying angles, I could make petals look like paper, tightly bunched flower heads look like lips. Going in tight, I attempted to show the beauty of the flowers in a surreal way. The warm spring sunshine of the last few weeks had not only ushered the tulips into full bloom but enhanced their colour and vibrancy, so some of my photographs gained an almost unearthly quality.I’ve never felt so lucky to have my garden, this tiny oasis in densely crowded north London. In the land of quarantine, my house has never felt more like a castle, defending me from the warzone outside the front gate. In that castle, my garden is the green inner sanctum, a place of peace and tranquillity.As I sit here now, in the sunshine, I hear birdsong and the rustling of leaves, with the chirruping of children playing wafting in on the breeze. The sky above my head is free from planes and pollution and a brilliant blue. The sun, bright and sharp at this time of year, makes everything look crisp. In times like these, we remember that nature truly is life-affirming, and the simple act of flowers growing means so much. It shows that in an abnormal world, normality is king."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b4a6970b70bd4af583edcb24303b087ebede602/0_0_4480_6720/master/4480.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9d626a298a127ea9c8ccfcc3a7d67686 1400w","title":"economy recover coronavirus debt austerity","story":"The pandemic has necessitated huge borrowing – but post-crisis austerity would be the very worst way to deal with itWe do not know how this pandemic will end. We do know that we will be poorer when it’s over: GDP is plunging around the world.We also know that there will be a towering pile of IOUs left from the bills run up during the crisis. When it is over we will have to figure out how to repay them – or whether to repay them at all. That question will decide the complexion of our politics, and the quality of our public infrastructure and services for years to come. Unless we tackle this issue, coronavirus debts will be the battering ram for a new campaign of austerity.These numbers are impressive, daunting even. They offer an open door to conservative scaremongering. The first move in that tradition of debt politics is to invoke the tenuous analogy to a household. In this picture, debts are a burden on the profligate a moral obligation that must be honoured on pain of national bankruptcy and ruin.There are some circumstances in which this analogy is apt, specifically when you are an impoverished and desperate country dependent on foreign creditors who will lend to you only in the currency of another country, most commonly that of the US. Many poorer countries are in this position. Few rich countries are. Indeed, one of the definitions of being an advanced economy is that you are not.Advanced economies borrow in their own currency and overwhelmingly from their own citizens. For them, the household analogy is profoundly misleading. In fact, those seeking to rebut the misconceptions of the household analogy sometimes say we merely owe government debts to ourselves.That is a liberating thought. It makes clear that we are not in the position of a subordinate debtor nation. But it has a dizzying circularity to it. If we are our own creditors, are we not also our own debtors – master and slave at the same time? Ultimately, it is a bon mot that relies on treating the economic nation as a unit. That may look like liberation, but it is an illusion achieved by removing the real politics of debt – which are about class, not nationality.Historically, government debts were assets owned by the middle and upper classes, the famous rentiers. And taxes were overwhelmingly indirect and thus fell disproportionately on lower incomes.Today, the richest still own a disproportionate share of government debt. But the liabilities of the government are now widely distributed. They are staple investments for pension funds and insurers. Government debt is not simply a burden it is a highly useful financial asset, offering modest interest rates in exchange for safety. It is all the more useful for the fact that the government lives for ever and will generate revenue for ever through taxation. So it enables very long-term planning.The tax base today is much broader than it was a century ago. But who pays taxes – and who does not – remains one of the most urgent questions of the moment. A world in which coronavirus debts are repaid by a wealth tax or a global crackdown on corporate tax havens would look very different from one in which benefits are slashed and VAT is raised. And it is very possible that debt service will be taken out of other spending, whether that be schools, pensions or national defence.As the great Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter remarked in the aftermath of the first world war, “the budget is the skeleton of the state stripped of all misleading ideologies”, the truest reflection of the distribution of power and influence.It is a distributional issue. But not only that. Debts may also affect the size of the cake itself. As we know only too well, a regime of austerity that keeps taxes high and government spending low is not conducive to rapid economic growth. And yet for debt to be sustainable, what we need is growth in GDP – to be precise, growth in nominal GDP, which includes real economic growth and inflation. Inflation matters because it acts as a tax on debts that are owed in money that is progressively losing its value. Price stability, the objective of monetary policy since the 1970s, no doubt has benefits for everyone, but most of all the creditor class.This is the awesome dilemma we will face in the aftermath of Covid-19. This is the battle for which we must brace. Not right now, but once the immediate crisis has passed. After the financial crisis of 2007-08, it was in 2010 that the push for belt-tightening began. Like revenge, austerity is a dish best served cold.Progressive politics cannot, of course, shrink from a battle about budgetary priorities. But it should resist fighting on the terms set by austerian debt-fear. In the circumstances of the UK or the US, alarmism about debt is false. And how false is being demonstrated by the crisis itself.There is one mechanism through which we can ensure we truly owe the debts to ourselves. That mechanism is the central bank. Its principal job is to manage public debt – and at a moment of crisis central banks do what they must. They buy government debts or, in what amounts to the same thing, they open overdraft accounts for the government.That has two effects that, acting together, have the potential to negate debt as a political issue. Central bank intervention lowers the interest rate. If interest rates are held down, debt service need not be an onerous burden. At the same time, the central bank purchases remove government IOUs from private portfolios and put them on the balance sheet of the central bank. There, they are literally claims by the public upon itself.When the central bank buys the debt it does so by creating money. Under ordinary circumstances one might worry about that causing inflation. But given the recession we face that is a risk worth running. Indeed modest inflation would help us by taking a bite out of the real value of the debt.Of course, ensuring that the central banks continue their crisis-fighting methods into the recovery period will itself require a political battle. Fearmongering about inflation is the close cousin of fearmongering about debt. We should resist both blackmails. We have the institutions and techniques to neutralise the coronavirus debt problem. We owe it to ourselves to use them.• Adam Tooze directs the European Institute at Columbia University and is the author of Crashed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5673b5178bfd48735a7ddf36c3b2317610917f1/4_0_2120_1272/master/2120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f25e00bf2161593773603469b9829363","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of purple","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘purple’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘purple’.Share your photos of what purple means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 29 April at 10am.

The school was judged “inadequate” following the inspection in March 2018.MPs on the committee were in the main keen to explore the impact of the pandemic on disadvantaged and vulnerable pupils, about whom concerns have been growing since schools closed five weeks ago.Spielman told the committee she was “seriously concerned” about the impact of school closures on the most disadvantaged children. Asked about the closure of alternative provision for children who have struggled in mainstream schools, she said: “The longer the closure, or almost closure, the greater the problems for those children.”She continued: “We know that home and online learning are very imperfect substitutes for the school experience. We know that children are losing education. It is not just children who are disadvantaged or academically behind, it is children without motivation. So it is in children’s interests to get back into school as soon as possible.”Spielman said Ofsted’s inspection framework already focused on children who face the greatest difficulties in their education.She also told MPs she did not expect Ofsted to resume full routine inspections before the end of the summer term. They were suspended in March as a result of the pandemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adc4b039941c66dea05d6b65151a98deeae58126/0_202_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d79ab1c49e3db18394f70c2230f55e1e","title":"meteorologists say 2020 on course to be hottest year since records began","story":"Global lockdowns have lowered emissions but longer-term changes needed, say scientistsAlthough the coronavirus lockdown has temporarily cleared the skies, it has done nothing to cool the climate, which needs deeper, longer-term measures, the scientists say.Heat records have been broken from the Antarctic to Greenland since January, which has surprised many scientists because this is not an El Niño year, the phenomenon usually associated with high temperatures.The US agency said trends were closely tracking the current record of 2016, when temperatures soared early in the year due to an unusually intense El Niño and then came down.Abnormal weather is increasingly the norm as temperature records fall year after year, and month after month.This January was the hottest on record, leaving many Arctic nations without snow in their capital cities. In February, a research base in the Antarctic registered a temperature of more than 20C (68F) for the first time on the southern continent. At the other end of the world Qaanaaq, in Greenland, set an April record of 6C on Sunday.In the first quarter, the heating was most pronounced in eastern Europe and Asia, where temperatures were 3C above average. In recent weeks, large parts of the US have sweltered. Last Friday, downtown Los Angeles hit an April high of 34C, according to the National Weather Service. Western Australia has also experienced record heat.In the UK, the trend is less pronounced. The daily maximum UK temperature for April so far is 3.1C above average, with records set in Cornwall, Dyfed and Gwynedd.Karsten Haustein, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford, said global warming was nudging closer to 1.2C above pre-industrial levels. He said his online tracker showed a relatively conservative level of 1.14C of warming due to gaps in the data, but that this could rise to 1.17C or higher once the latest figures were incorporated.Although the pandemic has at least temporarily reduced the amount of new emissions, he said the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere remains a huge concern.“The climate crisis continues unabated,” Haustein said. “The emissions will go down this year, but the concentrations keep on rising. We are very unlikely to be able to notice any slowdown in the built-up of atmospheric GHG levels. But we have the unique chance now to reconsider our choices and use the corona crisis as a catalyst for more sustainable means of transport and energy production (via incentives, taxes, carbon prices etc).”This was echoed by Grahame Madge, a climate spokesman for the Met Office: “A reliance and trust in science to inform action from governments and society to solve a global emergency are exactly the measures needed to seed in plans to solve the next crisis facing mankind: climate change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/157a5f8de1ca1e792f274a4b12913ee652e81a68/93_598_4667_2800/master/4667.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6fd9fc2891f2b38cd95e58dca6771e3","title":"the bliss of a quiet period lockdown is a unique chance to study the nature of cities aoe","story":"Empty streets and skies let the birds be heard and leave animals free to roam as well as allowing scientists to examine how humans change urban bioersityPeregrine falcons have swapped sea cliffs for the UK parliament and red-crowned parrots have left tropical forests in Mexico for the leafy neighbourhoods of Pasadena.Cities all over the world have their own unique ecological concoctions created by mixing human settlements with wildlife. Coronavirus-induced lockdown is changing the daily rhythm of urban life, shining a light on emboldened animals that usually prefer to remain hidden. Biologists and ecologists normally feel more at home studying remote jungles or inaccessible mountain tops, where “real” nature is. But as our planet gets covered with cities, more and more environments are being run by humans, who have become a super keystone species.This week, the \u0027s Age of Extinction site is looking at bioersity in cities and urban areas around the world, shining a spotlight on the under-appreciated world of nature hidden among the highrises and busy roads.The Covid-19 outbreak has seen cities and towns across the world go into lockdown which has enabled wildlife such as wild boar, deer, monkeys, foxes and even lions to venture into territory previously dominated by humans. It has also offered us the chance to notice and appreciate the natural world in cities in an unprecedented way.In this special series of reports we\u0027ll be looking at how animals and plants adapt to city life, what to look out for right now and how we can encourage more wild cities in the future.Cities are not mausoleums for nature but modern-day versions of the Galapagos archipelago, according to Menno Schilthuizen, author of Darwin Comes to Town, a book about contemporary evolution in cities where rapid changes can be observed within a human lifetime.“Only in our flights of fancy can we still keep nature orced from the human environment. Out in the real world, our tentacles entwine nature’s fabric,” Schilthuizen writes. “While we have been trying to save the world’s crumbling pre-urban ecosystems, we have been ignoring the fact that nature has already been putting up the scaffolds to build novel, urban ecosystems for the future.”Haunting images of wolves, bison and bears living in deserted towns following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster indicate what happens when humans leave a place for good. The coronavirus lockdown shows how quickly wildlife closes in. “It is interesting to consider how fragile our urban environment is. If we’re not constantly present, it’s being taken over by nature very quickly,” says Schilthuizen, who is professor of evolutionary biology at Leiden University in the Netherlands.The unique thing about coronavirus is that it is causing multiple cities across the globe to simultaneously go into hibernation. This gives ecologists an insight into how humans change urban bioersity in multiple locations. “Animals are nearby, constantly watching us from the outskirts and the forests, and as soon as our presence seems to be abating they start exploring where new terrain could be won … It makes you aware of how we’re constantly competing with many species,” says Schilthuizen.Historically, urban environments have been seen as too contaminated by humans to teach us anything important about bioersity. In the past few decades this has started to change but we still know little about the urban wildlife we live alongside, says Rana El-Sabaawi, associate professor of biology at Canada’s University of Victoria.“If you look in the literature, the field of urban ecology doesn’t really come into its own until the last decade or two. Before that there were a smattering of papers and reports, mostly descriptions of bioersity trends in and around specific cities. In recent years there has been a growing appreciation of the ecological mechanisms that explain bioersity in the city,” she says.Urban environments are messy places (full of lights, pollution and people pursuing their own interests), which makes studying them difficult. It’s all very well to observe animals and plants in urban places, but understanding how these different processes fit together is more problematic.At the same time, there is increasing recognition that few places on Earth are free from human influence – there is a plastic bag at the bottom of the Mariana  Trench, and Antarctica’s remote glaciers are flecked with microplastics. Understanding places where humans interact with nature most should help planners and developers create cities that hold as much wildlife as possible.Broadly speaking, “sensitive” species, whose habitat is destroyed by urban developments, are unlikely to venture into urban areas. “Opportunists”, which have a much broader diet and high tolerance for noise and pollution, are more at home. Coronavirus means species that might lie in the grey area between these categories are now more likely to venture into previously unexplored urban areas.Racoons, pigeons, foxes, gulls and crows are opportunists and considered a nuisance by many humans who live alongside them. Animals such as these, which scavenge human rubbish to get food, are likely to be struggling during lockdown.Ring-necked parakeets might disperse away from urban parks and forage on agricultural land instead. Residents of the East Riding in Yorkshire have been warned seagulls could be more aggressive because there are fewer seaside day-trippers feeding them leftover chips. In Amsterdam, even coots – which sometimes line their nests with plastic – may have a tough time finding replacement materials.“Often what happens when food supply runs short is increased competition and aggression between animals,” says El-Sabaawi. “There have already been fascinating reports from Asia about monkey ‘brawls’ caused by food shortages. If the food shortages are really severe and extended, then populations might decline.”Other animals seem to be doing well with fewer people on the street. Urban songbirds, for example, can communicate more easily when the din of background traffic is reduced. Deer, badgers and wild boar might be emboldened to start pinching food from suburban gardens or roadsides. A herd of goats has been running riot through the Welsh town of Llandudno, munching on people’s gardens as they go.Most researchers are agreed these species’ corona-related behavioural changes are temporary and the luxury of living in town will stop when humans re-emerge. Lockdown will probably have a similar effect on wildlife populations as an exceptionally wet or hot year – provided things return to how they were.Cities are also powerhouses for permanent changes. For example, there are distinct subspecies of mosquitoes found on the London underground that no longer hibernate and feed on human blood as opposed to bird blood, according to research published in Nature in 1999. Even more remarkable, mosquitoes living on different tube lines do not mix so the population living on the Circle line is genetically different to those living on the Piccadilly line. This change happened over 100 generations or so – significantly faster than Charles Darwin thought possible.Urban blackbirds are also morphing into a new species, according to Schilthuizen. Across European and north African cities, blackbirds living in urban areas have developed shorter bills (probably thanks to an abundance of bird feeders and easier pickings in cities). Traffic noise has caused urban blackbirds to sing in the night when it’s quieter, and they also breed around a month earlier than their countryside cousins.Scientists think the urban blackbird, Turdus urbanicus, could be the first of many species to adapt to life in the city. Schilthuizen writes: “The pace of evolution is set by ecological opportunities that emerge from human interactions … In those pressure cookers of environmental change, species will need to speed up their evolution or become extinct.”Changes in botany have been massive in the past decade with huge shifts in wild plants living in urban areas, according to London-based botanist Dr Mark Spencer. “Plants have lived with us in our cities for thousands of years and they move along with us and they tell stories about us,” he says.London is an important focal point for the arrival of non-native species in the UK, either arriving accidentally by international trade (via wool, for example) or escapees from domestic horticulture. Cities are the first pitstop for species that could later spread around the whole country.For example, loquat (a common cousin of plums, cherries and apricots) is becoming established in London where Greek and Turkish communities typically live because people spit out the pips on the ground after they’ve eaten the fruit. And now it’s starting to sprout in the wild.Widespread non-native plants such as Himalayan balsam, buddleia and Japanese knotweed were originally imported for horticulture. “The detailed research on the entry points of these well-established non-native species is not done,” says Spencer. “In this country, we have a focus on doing biological and ecological research on nice pristine chalk grasslands – which are wonderful habitats. We don’t like getting down and dirty with weird and wonderful street pavements. That’s pretty much it, putting it in crass terms. Urban areas are very poorly understood.”“Ordinary” urban areas are places we desperately need to understand, Spencer says. “A lot of this stuff is not about traipsing around recording hyper-rarities or incredible orchids, it’s about getting the common and the widespread.”People sending in samples of species can help researchers collect more accurate records about changes in botany. “One of the things we’ve been trying to do for the past decade or so in natural history is get past this idea that it’s elite, purely expert, frankly old, white, male, grey tops that can do it, and no one else can. Actually, the only way you get past this is by supporting people,” says Spencer, who encourages people to submit plant sightings to i-record.Will lockdown change how people interact with nature? Probably not, says Schilthuizen. “I’m enjoying the quiet. I keep thinking to myself, this is the way things should be, without constant air traffic overhead and without constant noise of traffic and throngs of people spending money on the streets … But I think we have a short memory. The bliss of a quiet period – or the memory of that period – will disappear quite quickly.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee4703cbc17bc3671f462a054b7410a88dbc45a6/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d17464f80007c43aac190a01298f039e","title":"new trends fashion covers reflect the era of coronavirus","story":"Physical distancing and editors’ attempts to strike right tone are set to transform glossy magazinesA single red rose on the cover of Vogue, hospital car-park shoots rather than exotic locations, celebrities captured without makeup, supermodels relegated in favour of nurses and doctors, and amateur selfies usurping professional photography. This summer’s newsstands and billboards are set to look unlike any other season in the history of fashion.The logistics of physical distancing and a zeitgeist paralysed by the pandemic are combining to turn fashion upside down. Glossy magazines are scrambling to figure out what faces should be on the covers of the magazines that will hit stands during the crisis – and how to generate new imagery while travel and physical contact is curtailed under lockdown.The celebrity on the cover of the July issue of Harper’s Bazaar has been shot “by someone isolating in a remote location with the celebrity we had already booked”, said the magazine’s fashion director, Avril Mair. With no fashion editor allowed to visit, clothes were sent direct to the subject at home and styling guided by the magazine team over Zoom.A fashion story in the same issue was shot by the photographer Erik Madigan Heck at home with his wife, Brianna Killion, as model, without styling, hair or makeup. The theme of the issue is “that great creativity can come out of times of great crisis”, said Mair.“Everything is different”, said Albert Read, managing director of Conde Nast Britain. “We’ll see that in the upcoming issues: the editorial production, a tonality and vision that is appropriate to the time.” Its leading title, British Vogue, will focus on supporting healthcare workers in upcoming issues.Vogue’s stance was reflected in its decision to cancel an interview for the August issue with the singer M.I.A. in light of her anti-vaccination stance. Last week, the singer posted a screengrab of a message from the magazine which reads: “Considering our August is an issue where we’re chronicling the struggles of the NHS to cope while a vaccine is tried to be made we don’t feel we can have her involved. It just wouldn’t be right. All of our issues July-September will be supporting the frontline heathcare workers and we need to be respectful of them and all they are doing until a vaccine exists.’’Grazia was quick to transpose into a different key as the crisis unfolded. “I’ve always believed that you should be able to look at a Grazia cover and it be obvious what week it hit newsstands,” said the editor, Hattie Brett. “The first week of working from home, it was clear we should focus on NHS workers – so we ripped up all our pre-existing plans and shot four medics for the cover.” Earlier this month, Elle ran a digital portfolio of portraits of women doing essential work in supermarkets, on trains, and in schools and homeless shelters.“The smart editors will make magazines that reflect this moment,” said Jefferson Hack of Dazed Media. “Fashion with a capital F is on pause right now.” But magazines that have traditionally served their readers escapism and glamour are struggling with how to balance this historic role with the need not to appear out of step with the times.Tonal challenges are compounded by the logistical issues of producing imagery under social distancing rules. Imran Amed, editor-in-chief of the Business of Fashion, said “editorial and advertising shoots have come to a virtual standstill”. Carol Hayes, who helms an established agency for makeup artists and hairdressers, reports business having “ground to an almost immediate halt”. The JuneJuly cover of American Vogue is an Irving Penn close up of a rose, the magazine’s first still-life cover in 50 years.Other workaround strategies include models putting selfie skills honed on Instagram to good use by shooting self-portraits, often on smartphones, and photographers who co-habit with a spouse, partner or adult child model offering ready made at-home creative teams. “The few shoots we are doing at the moment are like none I’ve ever worked on,” said Brett. A recent cover shoot with the British TV presenter Laura Jackson was fortuitously made possible because Jackson’s husband, Jon Gorrigan, is a photographer. Zara’s latest campaign features self-portraits by models including Malgosia Bela wearing clothes delivered directly to them at home.Domestic in setting and lo-fi in execution, the resulting images may capture something of the spirit of the moment. Johnnie Boden is currently sourcing photographer and model couples to showcase the Boden summer range with the duos managing styling, and hair and makeup. and “the photographs reflect the current climate - out of necessity, more than anything.”Clare Hornby of the Me+Em womenswear label has enlisted her teenage daughters to model. “The idea came to me as I was trying to juggle work and kids. The sun was out, so I asked them to go and create content.”Fashion photoshoots are “a hands-on business”, said the photographic agent Anita Grossman. “A stylist will want to adjust the clothes to make them look right.” Makeup artists and hairdressers are in the eye of the industry’s economic storm right now, but short term logistics look likely to impact on many. The film-set scale fashion photoshoot – fully staffed with a team including catering, set design, runners and assistants – may never return.The Harper’s Bazaar celebrity cover for July, shot in isolation, has “a beautiful intimacy which you don’t generally achieve with a big team on set”, said Mair.“High-production shoots are going to look old-fashioned, after this,” predicted Hack. “People will want the dream again, but it will be about poetry, not artifice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e02834a48bf272110f6e7db45a9b3eff5f582a48/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03060aa59b8db650656975f3523f09a4","title":"tell us about your ultimate holiday food recipe","story":"We want to know the recipe you use to recreate the experience of food, freedom and funWith holidays on hold for the foreseeable and cooking a rare lockdown joy, your culinary repertoire can be easily expanded by recalling dishes that bring back memories of happier times on trips away.

If I can watch TV, or catch up on my to-do list while dinner bubbles on the stove, I am fairly relaxed about how long it takes. That’s how it is with this crumbly, fragrant and moreish tart. Get all the prep and clearing up done while the pastry is baking, and you will be rewarded with a supper that feels like it has come from the best deli in town.Buttery, flaky pastry, sweet gorgonzola and the virtue of a green vegetable – the perfect dinner.320g shop-bought puff pastry200g broccoli, cut into small florets100ml whole milk250ml creme fraiche3 eggs4-5 sprigs fresh thymeSalt and black pepper150g blue cheese (I used gorgonzola dolce)Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)gas 6. On a floured surface, roll out the pastry so that it fits a 25-27cm quiche or tart dish. Gently line the dish, pushing the pastry into the sides, allowing any excess to hang over the edge. Prick all over with a fork, line with baking paper or foil, fill with baking beans or rice, and bake for 25 minutes. Once golden, remove the paper or foil and the beans, and bake for another five minutes. Set aside to cool.Meanwhile, bring a pan of salted water to a boil, blanch the broccoli for two minutes, then drain and leave to steam dry.Whisk the milk, creme fraiche and eggs vigorously, until frothy. Strip the thyme leaves from their branches, add to the eggs and season well.Turn down the oven to 180C (160C fan)gas 4. Once the tart case is cool, trim any excess pastry, then lay in the cooled broccoli in an even layer. Dot teaspoons of the gorgonzola around the broccoli.Put the tart on to a tray to catch any overflow, then carefully pour over the egg mix so it comes right up to the brim, adding a splash more milk, if necessary. Bake in the middle of the oven for 35-40 minutes, until golden and just set in the middle.

Do you need to treat frozen seafood differently?Tom, WolverhamptonHe’s not wrong there, but even so, an unnaturally uniform frozen cod portion is never going to compare with a prime fillet, so, yes, you do have to use it slightly differently. “Frozen is especially useful in fish cakes, pies and curries – anything that’s a bit forgiving,” Gokani says. “It also benefits from being paired with strong flavours. Obviously, don’t cook from frozen – defrost it fully first.” Try telling that to my mother: one of her signature dishes is frozen white fish baked on a base of onion, garlic, peppers and tomato until it’s no longer crunchy, and the memory sends me all Prousty.Rick Toogood of Prawn on the Lawn in Padstow and London agrees that punchy flavours are the way to go. “Frozen fish isn’t my specialist subject, but there’s a time and a place for everything. Jazz up fish pie mix, say, by poaching it in milk until just underdone, add a spoonful of Thai green curry or madras curry paste – for me that means Patak’s – top with a coriander mash and bake. The topping doesn’t have to be spuds, either: swede would work brilliantly here.” Add oomph to your fishcakes, too: “Poach the fish in milk, cook potatoes in the same milk, mash with dill, gherkins, mustard and lemon zest, combine with the fish, then breadcrumb and cook until golden.”Frozen shellfish also benefits from robust accompaniments – prawns especially. “Coat in desiccated coconut, deep-fry and serve with sweet chilli sauce for quick coconut prawns,” Toogood advises. “Or give big ones the ceviche treatment – red onion, chilli, tomato, lime juice and salt.” As for those bags of mixed frozen mussels, squid and prawns, they’re ideal in a cheat’s bouillabaisse, he says, and if you have a frozen fillet to add to the pot, so much the better: “Soften onion and garlic with some thyme, add white wine, saffron, if you have it, a tin of tomatoes, season and cook down, then add the seafood and cook through.”Frozen white fish is also fantastic burger material, Toogood says: “You can’t go wrong with a breaded fillet packed in a bun with lettuce, slaw, gherkin and lime pickle mixed with mayo – which is genius stuff, by the way.” Or smear wholegrain mustard on a frozen fillet, wrap in foil and bake. “That’s so, so simple, and mega-tasty.”So much for this not being Toogood’s specialist subject … though he does fail to mention the finest frozen fish product of all: fish fingers – served, of course, in white bread with an obligatory dollop of salad cream.

Over breakfast, I checked Instagram and noticed four different friends flaunting the cinnamon scrolls they had made. A little later in the morning, I rang my partner, who told me he was munching on a cinnamon scroll his mum had baked the previous day. Then, in the early afternoon, the doorbell rang. The trio of red-headed children from next door gifted, from a safe social distance of course, the household with a plate of cinnamon scrolls that they’d whipped up. It was extremely adorable.As I chewed on a scroll (which was light, fluffy and expertly spiced – well done kids), I wondered: why the heck is everyone making these things? Is it just me? Is it a sign from the universe that I haven’t eaten enough carbs this quarantine, not that I need justification? Was this a weird glitch in the Matrix? And more importantly, does that make me Neo?There were too many pressing questions and so very few answers. I decided to do some yeast-based research and found that my hypothesis carried some weight. The cinnamon scroll (or cinnamon roll, or cinnamon bun, depending on where you’re from) seems to be having a moment.The global phenomenon of iso-baking has evolved over the past few months of quarantine. First, obviously, came the sourdough craze. Then there seemed to be a movement toward focaccia. Banana bread has been the baked good of choice in queer circles. Now, the cinnamon scroll has blindsided the rest from left field. What intrigues me about this particular link on the iso-baking chain of evolution is that it’s just so specific. Pre-quarantine, no one batted an eye at the humble cinnamon scroll. It strikes me as a cold-climate baked good, hardly something Australians have historically felt compelled to create, unlike the unfussy Anzac biscuit or luscious lamington. So why here, cinnamon scroll? Why now?I think it could be to do with a number of things.This past week I’ve noticed a real autumnal change in the air. Perhaps home bakers are sensing it and grabbing for the seasonal comfort of cinnamon.Some casual bakers are also finding that they have way, way more time on their hands. Homebound, the weekend muffin maker or late-night banana bread baker are working up the courage to attempt more committed, yeasted, baking experiences. It’s probably also a great school holiday project for those at home with kids, like my talented ginger neighbours.Or perhaps Australians are getting in on fika, a traditional Swedish mid-afternoon pause from work, to be spent with friends or family over a cup of coffee and cake (or, notably, a cinnamon scroll).I think, in the midst of a quarantine period filled with stress and uncertainty, exploring another culture’s style of comfort, cosiness and calm by noshing on homemade cinnamon scrolls is sort of a substitute holiday.Either that or people are realising that they’ve got to use up their 30kg bags of flour before restrictions are lifted and the weevils appear. But I’m a romantic. Now, where’s my rolling pin?Makes 15 buns80 g unsalted butter, softened13⁄4 tablespoons caster sugar275 ml full-cream milk, plus 1 teaspoon extra for brushing1 teaspoon vanilla extract10 g active dry yeast450 g (3 cups) plain flour, sifted1 teaspoon freshly ground cardamomPinch of sea salt1 eggPearl sugar, for topping (see note)For the filling100 g unsalted butter, softened2 ½ tablespoons brown sugar2 ½ tablespoons caster sugar2 teaspoon ground cinnamonCream the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy. Warm the milk and vanilla in a small saucepan over a low heat until lukewarm, about 35°C.Stir in the yeast then add to the butter and sugar mixture, stirring to combine. Add the flour, cardamom and salt and mix with your hands until a shaggy dough forms. Tip out onto a clean work surface and knead for about eight minutes or until the dough is smooth and elastic. Transfer to a clean bowl, cover with a cloth or plastic wrap and allow to prove in a warm space for 45 minutes or until doubled in size.Meanwhile, to make the spiced filling, combine the ingredients in a small bowl and mix to a smooth paste. Set aside.Preheat the oven to 220°C. Line two baking trays with baking paper.Knock the air out of the dough and tip onto a lightly floured work surface. Roll out to a 40 cm × 30 cm rectangle. Spread the filling evenly over the dough, right up to the edges. Starting at the longer edge, roll the dough into a sausage shape. Using a sharp knife or pastry cutter, cut into 3cm wide slices. Place the buns, spiral-side up, onto the prepared trays. Whisk the egg with the extra milk and brush over the buns. Sprinkle generously with the pearl sugar.Turn the oven down to 190°C and bake for 15–20 minutes until golden and puffed. Eat warm or at room temperature on the day of baking, or on the following day lightly warmed under a grill.Note: Pearl sugar, sometimes called nib sugar or hail sugar, is a coarse white sugar most commonly used in European baking. It typically doesn’t melt during baking so is perfect for scattering over buns, waffles and cakes. Pearl sugar can be found in select baking supply stores substitute demerara sugar if unavailable.• This recipe has been adapted from Julia Busuttil Nishimura’s cardamom bun recipe in Ostro, Published by Plum, RRP $44.99, Photography by Armelle Habib."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a014d760ef49fa17f5a4abbed112ea4d4d9f2da/0_72_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=325369e2894c1b93cd3e9f0f5fd429a6","title":"colchester release four first team players due to financial pressure","story":"Colchester United have become the first club in the EFL to release players due to the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic, with the chairman, Robbie Cowling, admitting he could not afford to offer them new deals.A club statement on Monday confirmed that captain Luke Prosser, Frank Nouble, Ryan Jackson and Brandon Comley – who had all made more than 20 appearances for John McGreal’s side in League Two this season – will be released from their contracts at the end of June.“The club has a proud record of always paying its players in full and on time. We achieve this because I will never sign a contract if I can’t commit to fulfilling it. I just won’t gamble with other people’s livelihoods or with the club,” said Cowling. “It is for that reason that I have had to take the very difficult decision of not re-signing a number of players that under normal circumstances I would have been determined to re-sign.“I appreciate the decision will make the team less capable when the season does resume but it is very unlikely that we will be the only club to take such a step.”Colchester were in a play-off spot before play was halted in March and have yet to discover how the season will be resolved. The majority of League One and Two clubs remain determined to complete the season and continue to work towards resuming training on 16 May with a return to matches, most likely behind closed doors, on 6 June, provisional dates put forward by the EFL.“I wanted to make the decision as early as I could to give those players that are being released a head start in what will be a very difficult environment for out of contract players,” said Cowling. “They find themselves in this difficult situation through no fault of their own and I wish every one of them well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a38cca5c4eb8e72e1501f1edcd6264785df6ba5/0_78_3378_2027/master/3378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=705e6a0ee1833d61d984d4a9ceb6747d","title":"premier league to meet as government backs return as soon as possible","story":"Efforts will intensify this week to find a way to complete the Premier League season, after the government declared its desire to see football back “as soon as possible”.With Premier League clubs due to meet on Friday and a new grouping led by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport also convening this week, government officials talk of a “quickening of the pace”. But as some Premier League clubs open up their training grounds, the details of how elite sport could safely return remain unresolved.Only on Friday will top-flight clubs be presented by the league with a protocol to enable a full return to training. After a weekend of headlines trumpeting the return of top-flight football, with a three-week pre-season beginning in May and matches behind closed doors from 9 June, the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, told parliament on Monday that he backed a quick return but with a significant coda.“I personally have been in talks with the Premier League with a view to getting football up and running as soon as possible in order to support the whole football community,” he said. “But, of course, any such moves would have to be consistent with public health guidance.”A meeting between the DCMS, representatives of Public Health England and executives from Britain’s biggest sports, including the Premier League, is due this week to discuss how sport could safely resume. It is understood that any medical and safety plans will have to be signed off by PHE and the government.While the challenges of staging sport, even behind closed doors, are increasingly being discussed, those that precede any resumption of competition are also coming into focus.On Monday Arsenal, West Ham and Brighton reopened their facilities for socially distant training and Tottenham will do the same on Tuesday. With limits on time and the number of athletes, each club is setting its own terms. Arsenal allowed a maximum of five players on to their training pitches at any one time, while West Ham and Tottenham are limiting their players to solo running exercises. Spurs say no more than one player will be permitted on any pitch at any time and that players must arrive alone in kit and return home immediately after their session.According to one expert, conditions would have to substantially improve for final preparations for any resumption to begin in the middle of May.“With social distancing you can’t do the things that tick lots of boxes,” said Dr Craig Boyd, senior lecturer in sports performance at Manchester politan University, who has worked with elite football clubs and Team GB athletes. “Game-defining moments are sprinting, turning, stopping, tackling and doing those while considering opponents and the ball.“These are the most strenuous activities in football and increase the likelihood of success and failure. They are currently totally stripped back, and even in small groups they would be problematic. Getting over social distancing, that is the big thing.“Players will need less time to get fit than in normal pre-season because they won’t be flying around the world playing games. But until you’ve got the whole team back together the technical, tactical and physical can’t be worked on. And if you don’t have enough time to do it, it will increase the likelihood of injury.”In a move that appears to acknowledge the physical demands that will be put on players when the season recommences, Fifa announced on Monday that it would advocate the temporary introduction of up to five substitutions per team. These could be made in a maximum of three in-game slots and at half-time.“Safety of the players is one of Fifa’s main priorities,” said a spokesperson. “One concern in this regard is that the frequency of matches may increase the risk of potential injuries due to a player overload.“In light of this and the unique challenge faced globally in delivering competitions according to the originally foreseen calendar, Fifa proposes a larger number of substitutions be temporarily allowed at the discretion of the relevant competition organiser.” This could be applied until the end of the 2020-21 season and to international games until 31 December 2021.Elsewhere, Uefa announced that it would be releasing €236.5m (£206.3m) to its member associations. The money comes from the governing body’s HatTrick fund and is usually ringfenced for “investment, education and knowledge sharing”. Uefa’s president, Aleksander Ceferin, said that because of the “unprecedented challenge” of Covid-19 those restrictions were to be lifted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/249e52c02374af0af4d36289e9577f5037dcf560/0_0_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db1754fa92349aeb3c4e8fd9276aa1db","title":"football weekly manchester united arsenal rivalry project restart covid 19 podcast","story":"Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning, Nicky Bandini and John Brewin discuss Manchester United 0-1 Arsenal from 2002, Sir Alex Ferguson v Arsène Wenger, legacies, tackles, Mark Venus, ‘Project Restart’ and Detective WilsonJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Obsessively rearranging your groceries by best-before date. Binge-watching old episodes of Terry and June. Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we’re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones. Indeed, a recent study by Channel Mum found a quarter of British people now talk with neighbours they previously ignored. In short? Being confined to quarters is helping us rediscover a new sense of community.Every day brings more inspiring and creative digital gatherings, whether it’s quarantine quizzes, online aperitivo or friends slogging up their staircases thousands of times in a bid to conquer a virtual Everest. While we’re all busy rearranging our lives to adjust to the new norm, internet providers are doing their bit too. Taking capacity from commuter hotspots such as Waterloo to expand capacity in the suburbs is one way networks such as Vodafone are adjusting their behaviour. With internet connectivity remaining robust, here’s some inventive ways to escape the lockdown funk and embrace webcameraderie.The shutters might be closed on the nation’s pubs, but that hasn’t stopped people excitedly cheersing each other in brilliantly-named virtual pubs such as The Stay Inn and The Quarant Inn. Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra. Mimicking the ambience of a traditional pub, remote revellers participate in games and quizzes, plus attend talks on subjects ranging from homebrewing to Belgian beer.Even Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall is a fan of Houseparty, the chat app where groups have been throwing virtual dinner parties, staging karaoke singalongs and playing board games. Quarantine quizzes have flourished, too (check out Edinburgh-based Goose’s Quizzes on Twitch), along with online book clubs: Yiyun Li’s #TolstoyTogether sees the author lead fellow bibliophiles in a daily War and Peace reading. Feeling cheeky? Try gatecrashing one of the growing number of nuptials and other parties held online.

An expedition team of 30 climbing friends in the UK recently clambered up a virtual Mount Everest – all 8,848m of it – by trudging up stairs, steps and ladders within their own homes (often kitted up in full mountaineering gear). Elsewhere, tourist attractions such as the Louvre, British Museum and New York’s Guggenheim now offer 360-degree videos and livestreaming on their websites.

On ourselves, our relationships and what’s important to us. For some of us, that means reaching out to old friends, or healing old wounds with people we once thought we’d never speak to again. And in a way, the tech that helps us reconnect makes repairing those relationships easier: the screen gives us an element of safety, yet we can tap directly into those emotional connections we need to get us through this crisis.Here, three people who found isolation has had a positive effect on their relationships share their experiences – from building bridges, to creating the foundations for better communication, and reconnecting with family members they haven’t spoken to in years …Emma*: ‘Coronavirus gave me a reason to reach out to my brother’“I’d always had a good relationship with my brother, but it came crashing down last Christmas when my family discovered he’d been keeping his gambling addiction from us. He’d even taken money from Mum, and I was upset that he could put her through so much stress – I just couldn’t bring myself to speak to him. But after chatting to Mum over the past couple of weeks and hearing that he’d been helping her with food deliveries while she’s been in isolation, I decided to reach out. I sent him a text first and then he called me and we chatted about coronavirus and how we’ve been coping – a few days later, he FaceTimed me and gave me a tour of his new flat that I’ve never visited. I’d wanted to reach out to him before, but I was struggling to know how, so while lockdown is a very weird situation, it gave us both an excuse to push our differences to one side.“I also realised that life is too short – if my mum could move past what had happened, so could I. In fact, I’m probably speaking to him more now than I ever did before.”Michael: ‘Lockdown made me realise what’s important’“My ex-partner and I split a year ago and we share a young daughter, but our relationship has been really rocky ever since we broke up. We’d fight all the time and nasty words would be fired back and forth at each other over text message. But when the lockdown happened, it really made me take a step back and think about what’s important.“I reached out to her via text and also sent her some money for petrol, as she is driving our daughter between our two houses during this time – I wanted to make sure she knew I appreciated that she was helping me to see my daughter. It has felt like a real turning point for us and our relationship and it’s a really positive outcome from a situation that is out of our control. Now my daughter is with me and I’ve been sending my ex-partner pictures and we’ve been having civil conversations. Without this happening, I don’t know if we’d have ever reached this point.”Jo: ‘I’m connecting with family members I haven’t spoken to in years’“We have an extended family WhatsApp group made up of the descendants of my grandparents, both of whom sadly passed away recently. We used to use it every so often to share pictures from when people visited them, but over the years as inidual families grew, and as my grandparents got more frail, we didn’t have the same opportunities to gather together. And for some of the family, my only contact was an annual Christmas card. Since everyone has been staying at home for the past few weeks, though, the group has blown up with almost daily messages – pictures of the great-grandchildren doing their home school work, baking or learning to ride bikes without stabilisers in abandoned car parks.“My mum and dad both work in the NHS, with more than 60 years of service between them, so everyone shared videos from the 8pm clap for the NHS in recognition. And my brother, who’s a musician, livestreamed a gig on Facebook and lots of the family who’ve never had the opportunity to see him play before got to watch. It’s really lovely to feel connected to everyone, particularly as the two people that held us all together are no longer here.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedFamily has rarely felt more precious, nor has staying in touch with each other and the world.

Alex Gough, 39, is a tech engineer in San Francisco. They met in Antarctica in 2009Ross Island is beautifully bleak. It is home to penguins, seals, volcanoes and two Antarctic research bases. Keri, who is American and works for the US Antarctic Program, was running the stores and other services at McMurdo station. Alex, a Briton who was doing a PhD in sea-ice physics, was 1.9 miles (3km) away at New Zealand’s Scott Base. They met in February 2009, as winter was approaching. But dating in Antarctica was tricky. “You don’t get your hopes up about anybody there,” says Alex. Isolated in a cold little bubble with a fairly transient community, people fall in and out of love quickly.There was a lot of interaction between the two bases, which is how they stumbled across each other – although neither remembers the exact moment. “If there was any big event happening at either base, it was made with the other station in mind. I would say at least once a month there would be something,” says Keri. Sometimes the two bases would play each other at volleyball. Alex sometimes noticed her at the bar. “But other people, too,” he says, and Keri laughs.The US base held a Fourth of July party. “I think we decided we should get to know each other a little bit more,” says Keri. They ended up talking for much of the night. “We came from really different backgrounds – I grew up on a farm in Minnesota and Alex went to grammar schools in England.” She remembers him “playing footsie with me under the coffee table”. At the end of the night, says Alex, “most people went home and I made the excuse that I didn’t really want to go back to Scott Base that night it was quite late”.Keri liked Alex’s intelligence: “I felt we were on the same wavelength.” Alex also appreciated how clever she was, “but in a different way” from him. “I’m a logical, science guy and Keri has these great insights into how people behave. She is a fascinating person. I think we just clicked and we keep surprising each other.”They got together that night. “We weren’t sure if anything else would happen, but I kept going to see Keri and Keri kept coming to see me,” says Alex. They would meet a couple of times a week, with Alex usually making the relatively short (but sometimes -40C) trek between the stations, often in snow storms, or kite-skiing across the sea ice – because Keri had lettuce. “Lettuce is valuable down there,” says Keri. “We had a greenhouse at McMurdo station, so I would take my share and save it until Alex came over and we would sit on the couch and eat it.”He would bring her small presents – gingerbread men, a stuffed elephant. When you pack for a stint in Antarctica, many people bring small gifts to give to their friends and colleagues whenever they need a little lift. “Keri got most of them,” he says.Sometimes they would both set out from their respective bases at the same time and meet in the middle. “The auroras would be going off above our head, so we would watch that together,” says Keri. “We found patches of snow and pretended we were penguins and slid down the hill. It was very cute and almost makes me want to barf.” She laughs. “I don’t think either of us were really serious about each other at that point. It was just an Antarctica winter thing that was happening.”Once their time there was over, Keri went back to the US and Alex to university in New Zealand, so they started a long-distance relationship. Keri returned to work in Antarctica the following winter, still not sure if their relationship would work long-term, but there was no pressure from either of them. “The idea that we were probably going to break up meant that if we didn’t feel like breaking up, that was cool, too,” she says. Alex says: “It was always worth waiting for Keri.” They got married five years ago and now live in San Francisco.Their longest stint together has been 14 months most years, Keri goes back to Antarctica for about six months. Video calls from the base are rationed, but they keep in daily contact by phone and messages. “It was always expected that Keri would keep doing this, so we both understand the situation we’re in,” says Alex. It helps that they are independent people, says Keri. “We both haven’t cared very much about the way things are ‘supposed’ to be. We like our alone time.” Then, says Alex, “you meet each other again and you get to fall in love again”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0d67f09e5c6e0a15b49a6bffdf676b8dd552dec/0_0_5354_3213/master/5354.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d0bdc4a3f2469a71a1b94b3cb5cd395","title":"i love my partner but he always feigns ignorance of household chores","story":"He is an intelligent man, who has no reason to make childish domestic queries.

A summary of the cuts at the online-only Independent was published in the FT’s daily live blog.The Independent claimed Zoom log files showed an account registered to Di Stefano’s FT email address joined the video call for Independent staff last week for 16 seconds.The caller’s video was disabled, but some journalists apparently saw his name flash briefly on screen before he left the meeting.Minutes later a separate account joined the call, this time unnamed, the Independent said. It claimed the caller remained in audio-only mode with a black square displayed to journalists on the video call.The anonymous user account, which remained in the meeting until the end, was later shown to be linked to a mobile phone used by the same FT reporter.The FT began investigating Di Stefano after the Independent contacted senior figures at the paper with its allegations. The FT’s story about the cuts cited “people on the call” as its source. The Independent has also alleged that the account it says is linked to Di Stefano’s mobile phone gained access to an Evening Standard video call made by Osborne announcing large-scale furloughs and salary cuts on 1 April.The Independent editor, Christian Broughton, said: “We respect freedom of speech and understand the challenges of news gathering, but the Independent considers the presence of a third-party journalist in a staff briefing to be entirely inappropriate and an unwarranted intrusion into our employees’ privacy.“Our spokesperson had a full statement prepared for the press. Any interested reporters only needed to call and ask.”A spokesperson for the Evening Standard said: “For a journalist from the FT to have illegitimately accessed a private Zoom call is unacceptable. We are sure the FT will want to offer an immediate explanation and an apology.”The FT’s code of conduct states: “The press must not seek to obtain or publish material acquired by … intercepting private or mobile telephone calls, messages or emails. Engaging in misrepresentation or subterfuge … can generally be justified only in the public interest and then only when the material cannot be obtained by other means.”The FT declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6cac7efac22f58af964f642a9dcb94dc8805494/0_177_5076_3046/master/5076.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40f124d54ffc5c8e0602c65ae48d7305","title":"locked down advertisers ask is it too soon for jokes","story":"Brands seek to strike right tone as they adjust to new rules of the pandemicLucy Jameson is facing a conundrum as she advises cautious customers of her advertising agency: when are companies allowed to make jokes about the pandemic-induced lockdown?“I think it’s pretty soon,” said Jameson, a co-founder of Uncommon, reflecting on how advertisers are having to juggle the severity of the situation with the emotions of an audience who face being stuck at home for months. “You’ve got to do it cleverly. There are still lots of people dying, but people are desperate for a bit of light relief. It’s about striking the balance right.”Advertisers are struggling to work out how to promote their products during an age of physical distancing, walking the tightrope between continuing to sell goods where possible, building their brands, and trying not to look insensitive.Already there are a few basic rules of thumb that are changing how advertising looks. Footage of people socialising outside the home is out, as it may look jarring to audiences in lockdown adverts that resemble Zoom calls are in, but may already be a cliche and everyone’s trying to work out how to create new promotions without being allowed outside.“The number one thing advertisers are worried about is getting the right tone,” said Kelly Williams, ITV’s commercial boss. “People will remember how you behave during the crisis. We’re finding advertisers who can’t trade still looking to spend some money to keep their voice.”“Television advertising over the next couple of months will be as cheap as it ever has been,” said Williams, who said he had seen signs that some companies were starting to spend again. Until then, he said, audiences should to expect to see the same adverts more often, especially promotions for telecoms, charities, groceries and online shopping.Necessity has forced innovation, with ITV producing more material in-house and companies turning promotions on their heads. “Some advertisers are having to edit what they’ve got. McCain have got this lovely family campaign narrated by Ricky Tomlinson. They kept the same ad but got Ricky Tomlinson to change the voiceover.”The Co-op cancelled its Easter TV advertising campaign, which was originally promoting chocolate eggs, and donated millions of pounds of airtime to run an advert featuring supermarket staff urging people to support the food charity FareShare.Cathedral City created an advert about the joys of sitting at home with a cheese toastie by splicing together footage from old adverts and putting a new soundtrack over the top. Tesco promoted its Easter food sales by showing a video of a family holding a video conference to discuss how best to cook lamb.Jameson said many big-budget campaigns had been scrapped and her team were desperately trying to think of formats that could be produced in lockdown, with drone footage of empty streets suddenly popular. She predicted that television screens and online video services would soon be filled with adverts produced using animation, which can be produced remotely.“Advertisers who just running pre-corona stuff looks really weird,” she said. “You see ads for beer, which of course people are still going to want to drink, but somehow it just feels odd to see people in a pub at the moment.”Many companies have taken it upon themselves to promote stay-at-home messages, although there is a risk that people are baffled when companies that normally sell them beer or clothes start telling them how to stay safe in a pandemic.With ad spending collapsing, the government has stepped into the void with its big-budget national public health campaign, which has become ubiquitous – especially on news websites.“You need a short, informative message to get the public’s attention, certainly to resonate with younger audiences today,” said Jeremy Hine, the chief executive of MullenLowe Group UK, which has created the campaign. “‘Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives’ is like a wartime version.”Following the prime minister’s calls to evoke a blitz spirit, the campaign has been designed to evoke the spirit of the second world war, when the public were told that “coughs and sneezes cause diseases” and the never released “Keep calm and carry on” poster was created.However, Hine said brands should leave the evocation of war to the government and instead focus on reassuring the public with their advertising messages.“Being Churchillian is fine for politicians – a rallying cry to lead and set policy, it makes for a powerful, engaging ad campaign,” he said. “But that approach is less meaningful for a brand. Advertisers that are doing it well out there are those like McCain’s ‘staying at home’ work, or PG Tips with the idea of sharing a cup of tea over Skype. They are putting an arm around you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cf4d3794cc87e91cb3a3a63a064f6c9a22a2be8/0_132_4941_2966/master/4941.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7ba615414705df758ae58cd24abfb82","title":"never have i ever netflix mindy kaling","story":"Mindy Kaling’s new high school comedy takes its time but eventually finds its emotional footing in telling the story of a nerdy Indian American girlIt’s the first day of sophomore year, and 15-year-old Devi (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan) kneels in front of the Hindu shrine (and her blessed geometry textbook) in her home in Sherman Oaks, California. She has some requests, the profound goals of many high school girls: be cool, get hot, snag a boy. Or, as Devi spins at the start of this uneven but endearing 10-part teen entry from executive producer Mindy Kaling, she wishes her arms no longer “looked like the floor of a frickin’ barber shop”. Most importantly, she craves a boyfriend, but “not some nerd from one of my AP classes,” she says with Booksmart-style conviction. Said boy “can be dumb – I don’t care. I just want him to be a stone-cold hottie who could rock me all night long.”Devi is, needless to say, a virgin, and also an intelligent firebrand with a seemingly effortless command of power-points, witty barbs and topical-enough pop culture references (“Yeah, but he has a hot face. You’ll be like Zayn and Gigi,” she tells her friend as a boyfriend sales pitch). She’s also a master deflector, reeling, with a John McEnroe-style short fuse, from a massive loss. (McEnroe, for no reason seemingly beyond the fact they could get him, narrates the series.) “As you know,” she half-prays, “last year sucked for a number of reasons.” As abruptly revealed in what seems like a first-episode bit but is not, her beloved father – a sunny, unbridled presence in sepia flashbacks and dream sequences, and Devi’s only true best friend – died of a heart attack at her orchestra concert the year prior. The shock paralyzed her for three months (teenagers: not forgiving of the concept “psychosomatic”), forcing her to use a wheelchair. Only the sight of her crush, swim-team boy and said stone-cold hottie Paxton Hall-Yoshida (Darren Barnet) – a layered mystery or stock jock character, depending on the scene – and the promise of a “rebrand” in sophomore year, zaps Devi back on her feet.The first few episodes are clunky, as Devi, in denial-steeled striver mode, directs or antagonizes characters seemingly identified by one joke: her cousin Kamala (Richa Moorjani), the beautiful “good Indian” doctorate student at CalTech, wide-eyed with America and preparing for arranged marriage insult-throwing academic rival and rich kid Ben (Jaren Lewison). Checklist in hand, she directs her two best friends, Eleanor (Ramona Young) and Fabiola (Lee Rodriguez), into cool-adjacent boyfriends and a 10-step popularity plan. The show, which shares an aesthetic (and glittery, Spotify-ready pop soundtrack) with Netflix’s teen staple To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before, takes a swift and mostly tacit approach to ersity in its young cast classmates have designated the trio of Devi, south-east Asian Eleanor and Afro-Latina Fabiola as “the UN”, and the makeup of Sherman Oaks High is refreshingly and conspicuously not just white, cis, able-bodied. But for most other than Devi, this goes unmentioned the philosophy for the characters and, it appears, the show, is to attain the long-sought ideal of being “just a normal teenager” and expanding who gets to claim such a distinction.The main force for this is Devi, who recoils at the stereotypically strict immigrant parenting of her mother (an excellent Poorna Jagannathan), dismisses Indian culture and dreams of running away. In the season’s first half, she seesaws from deeply insecure to fearless – the plot launches as she writes a checklist for her best friends’ “rebrand” and, in a viscerally cringe-y scene, directly approaches Paxton, introduces herself, and asks if he would have sex with her (and, when this works, gushes “We’ll circle back about it!”).It is refreshing, and exciting, to see someone like Devi given the Fleabag treatment: space to avoid grief by misbehaving, an exploration of the bitter pills of growing up with a darkly comic touch. But in its early episodes Never Have I Ever applies the evidence of Devi’s assholery – soliciting of Paxton, lying repeatedly to her friends, never listening – too thick. It’s welcome to see an insolent Indian American star, which Never Have I Ever shares with Kaling predecessor The Mindy Project, self-sabotage with candor. But like the former show, it can also be grating. It’s not until the show’s later episodes, when it raises the emotional stakes for everyone – depicting Ben’s lonely home life, contextualizing Fabiola and Eleanor’s one-notes as “robot nerd” and “drama geek”, playing with the eternally gutting story that is getting stood up – that the jokes start to pack a punch.Ramakrishnan, a newcomer discovered through a global casting search, shows her inexperience here and there, but shines in the series’ more emotionally demanding scenes her rawness in the final episode moved me to tears. Which is evidence that, though not a perfect ride and likely to be overhyped out of starvation mode for any teen comedy resembling the actual ersity, horniness, and profanity of being a teenage girl, Never Have I Ever gets there, eventually. The series’ back half settles into a storyline balancing emotional depth with outbursts, and what emerges is a moving and original portrait of a teenage girl grappling with grief. It’s a bummer that it couldn’t have arrived at this version faster but, as Devi and the show learn, there’s ultimately satisfaction in ditching the attention grabs and finding your stride."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e117a13c8b6d99744ef3d5a85806f9ad2053146f/0_143_4285_2571/master/4285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55f1ea6e2651d3a6d01ff98498679ee0","title":"virgin media customers lose internet access in cities all over uk","story":"Series of outages across UK not due to lockdown creating spike in demand, company saysMillions of Virgin Media customers had problems accessing the internet during a series of outages across the country on Monday evening that the company said did not result from a network overload caused by high demand during lockdown.The company, which has 5.3 million UK customers, ran into problems just before 5pm with customers complaining that their home internet connection was cutting out.

Next up: the godfather of grime whose erratic genius has inspired successive generationsWiley told the world: “Eskiboy’s the reason why everybody’s here” back in 2006, on the cult classic Roll Deep single When I’m Ere. In grime’s relatively short life, the maverick genre has produced some of the finest albums and moments in contemporary British music: Mercury prizes and Glastonbury headliners. But there can only be one Godfather. A music career now in its fourth decade has produced 12 albums and a trove of singles, freestyles, radio sets, mixtapes and EPs. The man has more music than the Sahara has sand.As an in, his 2017 album Godfather offers a seamless trip through his sprawling back catalogue and legacy. Wiley’s 11th album arrived in the fires of last decade’s grime renaissance, a revival that saw the genre shatter music industry glass ceilings and swarm across the country. After landmark albums and single releases from Skepta and Stormzy, Wiley followed up with an album heralded as his crowning glory, a deserved victory lap to mark the success of a scene he had sacrificed himself to build: a showcase of the undisputed craftsmanship and erratic genius that has come to define his reign.Wiley’s music is a distinct brand. Over these 17 songs, he swings flow as sharp as a guillotine, razing through high-pitched and adrenaline-fuelled instrumentals. Bring Them AllHoly Grime, a duet with Dagenham MC Devlin, shows Wiley at his most thrilling. The two fence over heady production that sounds like an orchestra on speed. The song carries the dizzying excitement of a skye, the finesse of an F1 driver – and yet Wiley starts by mumbling: “Drink ‘nuff beers before the game, what d’ya call that? Georgie Best MC”, the kind of random cues that underpin his eccentric brilliance.Godfather puts a bow on Wiley’s legacy and sees him connect with successive grime generations. On This is an engrossing, long-awaited reunion with MC prodigies Chip and Ice Kid, who Wiley first took under his wing and up to BBC Radio 1 for a now-legendary freestyle session when they were no more than 16. Joe Bloggs is a titanic collaboration with D Double E and Footsie. And the final track, P Money is a tribute to its namesake, arguably grime’s most consistent practitioner in recent times. On a remix for the album, P Money offers a verse of his own.A marriage of the boyish hunger and seasoned wisdom Wiley has honed over decades, Godfather is the high watermark of a prodigious career.Treddin’ on Thin Ice (XL Recordings, 2004)In retrospect, Treddin’ on Thin Ice was less of an earth-shattering debut album proper, more the opening chapter teasing a thrilling catalogue to come. Still, the album features some of Wiley’s – and grime’s – most important records. Wot Do U Call It bullishly charts the splintering of UK garage and its winding devolution into what would eventually become grime. Perhaps most critically, the early grime instrumental Eskimo gets an official release. Originally produced around 2002, the arctic instrumental, inspired by Wiley’s fascination with bleak weather and winter, is a cultural artefact that showcases grime in its embryonic form.Around 2007, Wiley was threatening to retire from life as an MC. After Playtime Is Over, he planned a retreat into the shadows, leaving a new breed of MCs to take hold of the scene. Thirteen years later, the album originally pitched as his swan song ranks as one of his finest studio albums. Over a skittish set of largely self-produced songs, we find Wiley surging with composed aggression as he reflects on his life growing up in east London: Nothing About Me and Slippin detail the fears, desires and ambitions that had riddled his life so far.The Best of Tunnel Vision (Eskibeat Recordings, 2007)For a certain generation, the lore that surrounds Wiley began with the Tunnel Vision series, a string of seminal mixtapes feverishly written and released between 2006 and 2008. The first five emerged in a nine-month period, the kind of ine spark from which miracles are born. Double-disc collection Best of Tunnel Vision contains the scattered jewels from the series. At times it unspools like a diary, sketching intricate portraits of a claustrophobic grime scene and a long-torn relationship with London, as Wiley’s live-wire flow darts around like a stray firecracker.Wiley and DJ Score 5 radio set (Rinse FM, 2013)Wiley finds flow states in radio sets and freestyles, unshackled from the confines of choruses and 16-bar verses. During this half-hour display alongside DJ Score 5, we hear Wiley’s true essence, roving over transitioning synths and drum patterns. He has a history of this, with iconic freestyles on BBC Radio 1 with Tim Westwood and a string of classic early Rinse FM sets. But this is among his finest, playing out like an unrelenting stream of consciousness translated into sound.Wiley, The Godfather: ‘I accept the title now, more than ever’, by Joe WalkerWiley had been labelled elusive when it came to press and interviews. But one morning he abruptly changed his mind and let everybody know via Twitter that he was back in the country and looking to be interviewed that same morning. Joe Walker, then of RWD Magazine (now of Beats 1), took up the call. What followed was an enjoyable and lengthy two-part Q\u0026ampA between two iniduals well informed on the complexities of grime, British music and Wiley’s place within it.Wiley: The Eski Boy, by Emma WarrenA long read illuminating Wiley’s life outside of music, filling in the blanks on his family, upbringing and early years.Wiley: Godfather of Grime, Dizzee Rascal, BBK, New Film and more, by Not For The Radio This introspective interview released prior to Godfather gave us the long Wiley video interview that fans had longed for. The hosts of NFTR are respected pillars of Britain’s black music scene, and so Wiley was comfortable, breaking down his career from his early garage days to his relationship with Dizzee Rascal and his personal battles with self-image and street violence. A must-see that puts the character of this erratic genius in context."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c052ae59b45fd61db93ea75206adeecf21442966/0_130_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dcadff0ea56d4607da9783caf5ceab2","title":"surviving icu a story of recovery podcast","story":"Dave Lewins is a healthy, 60-year old helicopter pilot, who in March found himself in intensive care with Covid-19.

It can also be used to monitor plant responses to various stresses and changes in the environment, such as drought or wounding by herbivores,” said Dr Karen Sarkisyan, the CEO of Planta, the startup that led the work, and a researcher at Imperial College London.“We really hope to bring this to the market in a few years from now, once we make them a bit brighter, once we make the ornamental plants with this new technology, and once of course they pass all the existing safety regulations,” he added.Numerous animals, microbes and mushrooms – from fireflies to honey fungi – can glow, a phenomenon known as bioluminescence. This occurs when enzymes act on chemicals known as luciferins within the organism, resulting in energy being released in the form of light. However, bioluminescence does not crop up naturally among plants.The latest research is not the first time scientists have created glowing greenery – a development that has led to suggestions of everything from plant-based street lights to self-illuminating Christmas trees. Among previous approaches, researchers have delivered both luciferins and the enzymes necessary for bioluminescence into plants via nanoparticles, while other teams have incorporated bacterial genes for bioluminescence into plants.However, these approaches have had drawbacks: the delivery of a luciferin on tiny particles is more expensive and is not self-sustained, while the incorporation of bacterial bioluminescence genes involves a cumbersome process that results in only a weak glow. What’s more, said Sarkisyan, the latter approach appears to be toxic to plants.The new research takes a different tack, harnessing the recently discovered process by which fungi emit light. The team say that is important as the process involves a luciferin produced from a chemical that is naturally present in plants – caffeic acid.Writing in the journal Nature Biotechnology, Sarkisyan and a team of colleagues based in Russia and Austria report how they inserted four genes from a bioluminescent mushroom called Neonothopanus nambi into the DNA of tobacco plants. These genes relate to enzymes that convert caffeic acid, through a series of steps, into a luciferin that emits energy as light, before turning the resulting substance back into caffeic acid.The upshot is plants that glow with a greenish hue visible to the naked eye. “They glow both in the dark and in the daylight,” said Sarkisyan, adding that the light appeared to be 10 times brighter than that produced by using bacterial genes.The team found the site of the luminescence changed as the plants grew, and luminescence generally decreased as leaves aged and increased where leaves became damaged. Flowers produced the most luminescence, the team report.Sarkisyan said that in the future the team could insert the fungal genes into the plant’s DNA near genes that were activated by certain hormones. “You should be able to see the light coming only from the tissues where the hormone is currently active,” he said.Gary Foster, a professor in molecular plant pathology at the University of Bristol, who was not involved in the research, said the glowing plants would mainly be used by scientists rather than for applications such as plant-based street lights, but were nonetheless welcome.“Many luminescent marker genes have up until now required special light sources andor cameras to visualise the location of expression. The system reported here will make that process easier,” he said. Prof John Carr, from the University of Cambridge, also welcomed the work, but said there was more to be done. “The challenge now is to figure out how to make this engineered bioluminescence responsive to specific environmental, developmental, chemical or pathogenic stimuli,” he said. “This is essential if the technique will, literally, be able to throw new light on fundamental biological processes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac4579391a7e2cbccfe339c7d8718a14461a8ee3/0_160_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46a1b98be21acb95a40d02a5e352adb5","title":"uk betting firms to stop advertising on tv and radio during lockdown","story":"MP says block on all advertising should have been in place from day one to protect addictsThe UK’s biggest betting and gaming companies are to cease advertising their products on TV and radio during the lockdown, after MPs called for a moratorium.“From day one of this crisis we have sought to protect customers potentially at risk,” said Michael Dugher, the BGC’s chief executive. “This latest move by the regulated industry further underlines our commitment to safer betting and gaming with many people cut off and feeling anxious.”Members have until 7 May to remove their ads from TV and radio, and the ban will last until at least 5 June. However, companies will continue to use other marketing channels such as direct marketing, which includes ads on social media as well as by email and text messages.This month more than 20 MPs called for strict curbs on gambling during the lockdown, including a moratorium on advertising, and called the betting industry’s own proposals “very weak”.Carolyn Harris, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on gambling-related harm, said a block on all advertising should have been implemented from the first day of the lockdown to protect vulnerable people and addicts stuck at home.“This is a clear admission that gambling advertising is having a profound effect on the level of problem gambling we are seeing across the UK,” she said. “I welcome today’s decision but I wish it could have been made on day one of the lockdown, rather than six weeks down the line. The damage already done is hard to comprehend. It’s vital that this is extended to all gambling advertising on all mediums throughout this pandemic.”Dugher said there had not been any explosion in online gambling as had been feared, and overall gambling was down with no live sport on TV and high-street betting shops and casinos closed.“There will always be alarmist noises from anti-gambling prohibitionists who just want to grab headlines,” he said. “We are determined to do everything we can to protect customers potentially at risk during this lockdown period and beyond.”The BGC said its members accounted for about half of all gambling advertising on TV and radio, and it called on others in the sector – including the National Lottery operator Camelot – to also implement bans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc71742027789c9ded38ae6da4af0db7e2c1bbf1/0_71_5320_3193/master/5320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e995b4ef983fdaf656fbe73373cb9f90","title":"aaron rodgers green bay packers nfl draft jordan love","story":"Green Bay failed to give the star quarterback the receivers he needs in last week’s draft. It could be the final straw as the end of his career nearsIn 2019, the Green Bay Packers no longer needed Aaron Rodgers to be Aaron Rodgers. Now it seems they’re closer than ever to not needing Aaron Rodgers at all.Make no mistake, the Packers moving up to select quarterback Jordan Love in the first round of last week’s draft was a signal that Rodgers’ time in Green Bay is coming to an end, sooner rather than later. That his eventual exit will mirror that of Brett Favre is a juicy bit of irony: The young pup quarterback with all the physical tools, selected at the end of the first round, and asked to learn from the old pro, whose own physical gifts have started to wane.The hit rate on quarterbacks in that late first- to early second-round window is iffy to say the least. There is a reason they are still on the board – full of untapped potential in the eyes of the coaches but often stuck with a debilitating flaw in reality. Between picks 20 and 40, there have been 29 Pro Bowl berths, 21 of which are made up by Rodgers and Drew Brees. For each Lamar Jackson, there’s a Geno Smith or a Brandon Weeden or a Johnny Manziel.It’s not crazy for the Packers to think about the future, certainly not if they believe Love has the potential to be an All-Pro quarterback. But why now? That’s the question.The Packers were a game away from the Super Bowl last season. Rodgers is on the other side of his otherworldly peak, but he remains one of the best quarterbacks in the sport, one of the rare few who can balance efficiency with explosiveness. Rodgers needed a little bit more help in the passing game, that’s all. Not picking a receiver in a class loaded with sure-fire stars was a clear message to Rodgers: our success isn’t dependent on you.The Packers spent the rest of the draft committing to their run game, moving away from the all-pass, all-the-time offense that was constructed around vintage Rodgers back in the Mike McCarthy days. They added three interior offensive linemen, a thumping running back, and a tight endH-back, Josiah Deguara, who will serve the function of a modern fullback: shifting across the formation, from the backfield to the slot, as a blocker and pass catcher. Sound familiar? It’s a similar model to the one the 49ers have built in San Francisco, the one that waxed Green Bay in last season’s NFC Championship game.Defense and run game, that’s the Packers’ identity going forward. They spent over $100m this offseason to upgrade a defense that was good against the pass but lousy against the run in 2019.The trend started last year. The Packers became more of a run-based team, with their rushing offense ranked fourth in the league in efficiency while their passing game slipped outside the top 10. Rather than try to upgrade the skill spots, in a class loaded with receiving talent – of varying shapes, speeds, and body sizes (a receiver for all your needs! – the Packers doubled down on their run-first approach.All of this points to the inevitable: A Rodgers-Packers orce.The timing of the split isn’t tricky to figure out unless Rodgers tries to preemptively force a move. All signs point to 2022. Trade Rodgers now, and it would trigger a $45.9m cap charge. Wait until 1 June, however, and that number drops to a more palatable $14m in 2020 with the rest of the money pushed to 2021.Moving on that quick would be in the event of Rodgers demanding a trade. More likely, the Packers have two years on the clock. Super Bowl or bust, as it has been for the better part of a decade. By the time 2022 rolls around, a Rodgers-trade cap hit will be easier to navigate, with a charge of just $17m.By that time, the team would hope Love has been able to grow and develop on the bench. And even if he hasn’t, it will be his time anyway – teams don’t trade up in the first-round for a quarterback and not give them a look at some point.The doomsday scenario for Green Bay, of course, is that Rodgers demands out now. Listen closely enough and you can almost hear him venting: What? You don’t believe in me any longer? Ship me somewhere else. I’ll show you.Such a situation has the potential to get just as ugly as Favre’s exit when Rodgers joined the team. And now comes the careful combing of Rodgers’ record: Did he only shine against bad teams? Is one championship enough?No and yes. Rodgers remains an All-Pro caliber player. His arm strength is still there, his accuracy on point, his movement, the area that makes him an all-time-great, has only become more refined as he has aged.In 2019, Rodgers’ numbers across the board were excellent, even if some of the visceral signs of greatness had dipped. Instead of eight to 10, what-in-the-world throws a game, there were two. And that was by design. But his efficiency numbers held firm, as much a part of Rodgers’ brilliance as his wild, off-platform throws. He finished third in the league in big-time throws v turnover worthy throws, and sixth in completion percentage on throws under pressure. Together, they represent the best statistic we currently have of a quarterback as a “passing playmaker”. Talk of any decline has been greatly overstated.Teams would be queuing up to grab a quarterback fitting that profile tomorrow, and would be happy to fork over a significant asking price to boot. If 2022 is the date, Rodgers will be 38, with enough years in the tank for a team to justify handing over a high draft pick or two. Already, teams will be preparing their cap sheets with the idea of snagging Rodgers between now and then.It’s over to the quarterback himself, now. He has every right to be pissed off, while also understanding that this is how The Game works – being on the other side of it himself should provide some perspective.Now, does he stick or twist? Spend two seasons trying to deliver another title to Green Bay or try to force his way out before next season, whenever that winds up being?

Without it the track would be unable to meet either hosting fees or the expense of putting on the race if it is allowed to take place by the government.However, F1 and Silverstone have publicly committed to attempting to hold at least one race and potentially two at the circuit this year. Although both declined to make any official comment on the financial arrangement they have reached, it is understood that the hosting fee is to be waived and that F1 will meet the costs incurred by the circuit, in effect renting it from its owners, the British Racing Drivers’ Club. Last week F1’s owners, Liberty Media, made financial arrangements to free up cash in order to cover expenses such as this over the forthcoming months.F1 and Silverstone are also considering hosting two races on consecutive weekends at the circuit as the sport attempts to make up for the 10 meetings that have been called off this year. Stuart Pringle, Silverstone’s managing director, said they were working closely with F1 and the department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to address how the grand prix, set for 19 July, could be held behind closed doors.“Of course we want the race to happen,” he said. “The challenge is this is a situation that is unfolding and quite what the scale, the costs associated with that, the logistics, the complications … all of that is still being worked through.“It’s not as simple as me giving a yes or no answer or a figure. It’s actually understanding the scale of the problem. We’re totally optimistic we can help Formula One with a decent season, and one that we can play a meaningful role.”Silverstone renegotiated their contract with F1 in 2019, signing what they described as a “sustainable deal” for five years, having initiated a break clause two years earlier because of the level of hosting fees. The race is regularly the best attended of the season, with more than 140,000 fans present last year. Despite losing the income from spectators, there is clearly confidence that financially Silverstone will be able to weather the storm caused by the coronavirus outbreak.“We were an early adopter of the furlough scheme because we had to close our business,” said Pringle. “We need to get back as a business but we can’t do it if it risks killing people. We are going to need support from our bank but there aren’t many businesses that won’t and they are supportive. We are very confident we can ride this out, it’s just going to set us back.”Hosting fees are one of the three largest sources of income for the sport and losing them means it will have to absorb a major financial hit, especially if F1 has to extend the financial arrangements to other circuits such as Spa and Monza. Almost all European races rely to a great extent on the income from spectators. However, holding races, even behind closed doors, goes some way to meeting commitments to broadcasters and sponsors.The French GP was set to take place on 28 June but its cancellation has been long-expected after the country’s president, Emmanuel Macron, banned mass gatherings until July. F1 has been in extensive planning and discussions to consider how and when the season may begin and Austria, where lockdown restrictions have already been relaxed, was expected to be the first meeting.“We are now increasingly confident with the progress of our plans to begin our season this summer,” said Chase Carey, the chairman of the F1 Group. “We’re targeting a start to racing in Europe through July, August and beginning of September, with the first race taking place in Austria on the 3-5 July weekend.”Carey also indicated that potential plans to extend the season into January 2021 had not been pursued. “September, October and November, would see us race in Eurasia, Asia and the Americas,” he said. “Finishing the season in the Gulf in December with Bahrain before the traditional finale in Abu Dhabi, having completed between 15 and 18 races. We will publish our finalised calendar as soon as we possibly can.”Austria is also in discussions about hosting two races in succession. Should the Red Bull Ring host two races on 5 and 12 July, a week off would likely be required if Silverstone were also to hold two, shifting the first British Grand Prix to the 26 July. The circuit has said it is willing to move the event. The Belgian Grand Prix, too, will almost certainly have to move from its proposed date of 30 August, because public gatherings are banned in the country until the end of that month. F1’s new calendar is expected to represent a complete rescheduling of the remaining events."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aeea94a8894e133efc4dbaf3301aa23ca08f878a/0_221_5632_3379/master/5632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4f1b0526712289c73b4c2fbc5208f4b","title":"ecb private investment boost the hundred cricket","story":"The England and Wales Cricket Board has been urged to open up the Hundred to private investment – including equity stakes for counties and even Indian Premier League team owners – in response to the coronavirus crisis.An ECB board meeting on Wednesday will discuss the tournament’s postponement until 2021 but its chief executive, Tom Harrison, has countered talk of a full cancellation by stressing its importance to English cricket has been “accelerated” by the pandemic.This has led Oakwell Sports Advisory, a consultancy group that lists the Premiership Rugby investors CVC among its clients, to recommend turning central payments to the counties from the Hundred into equity stakes and potentially opening it up to private investment more widely.“This has real capital value for a county. This will attract potential private capital into buying stakes in Hundred franchises and help counties fund the overall game.”Oakwell also states more should be done to attract leading Indian players to the Hundred. The BCCI is yet to allow such as Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma to join overseas Twenty20 leagues but investment from IPL franchise owners could change this.“Indian investment into the Hundred, including from IPL team owners, may facilitate the involvement of Indian players in the longer term. In addition to generating revenue out of India, this would be vital in unlocking the south-Asian UK-based fanbase.”The ECB rejected a private franchise model for Twenty20 in 2008 and on creating the Hundred opted to follow Cricket Australia’s approach to the Big Bash League by retaining full ownership of the eight teams whether the post-coronavirus climate forces a rethink remains to be seen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1758073d75d5dfb4d138930def9fb2ebb7ec792e/0_201_6144_3686/master/6144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d8caa17e86ee603ccbb8ce1b399b684","title":"alexander ekman eskapist midsummer nights dream review audacious","story":"Available onlineTwo dance works by the Swedish choreographer are visually stunning, meshing movement, theatre, design and musicAlexander Ekman’s Eskapist (★★★★★) is a ballet that es into the illusions conjured by one man’s imagination – nominally the eponymous Eskapist (Oscar Salomonsson), but really we’re looking at the fertile, roving mind of Ekman himself.The Swedish choreographer is best known in the UK for a couple of clever, witty short works made for small companies around a decade ago (Cacti, Tuplet). But since then he’s been scaling up, choreographing for major European ballet companies, including two epic works for Royal Swedish Ballet: Midsummer Night’s Dream (2015) and Eskapist (2019). The latter especially capitalises on the scale and versatility of company and venue, a vast stage extended over the front stalls, on which Ekman offers a bombardment of fantastical images, realised with the help of Danish fashion designer Henrik Vibskov, who does a Mad Hatter’s couture party of eccentrically structured silhouettes. There are cone-headed women with plants growing out of their scalps, two men covered in grass, a stage full of Pharrell hats. There’s a man taking a shower in the middle of the stage, random vocal expulsions, curtains opening and closing, stages rising and falling. (This is a post-Pina Bausch, post-William Forsythe’s Impressing the Czar world.)Following someone else’s dreamlike tangent doesn’t always make for fulfilling viewing, but Ekman is engaging in his unpredictability. It helps that it’s so visually striking, but the randomness is at the service of a bigger idea. Ekman drops hints and motifs and meaning untangles then coalesces, with a short film channelling the mood of a Spike JonzeCharlie Kaufman movie, a wide-eyed Salomonsson seeking to escape a mundane life by submitting completely to his own imaginary world.And the dancing? It drifts from classical-ish ballet to a step that looks like the running man bare feet to pointe shoes to crazy platforms. Ekman is less interested in establishing a choreographic style than the right atmosphere at each moment, in a total meshing of movement, design and music (by Mikael Karlsson).Ekman also finds hypnotic pleasure in the company moving as one, creating a morphing momentum that’s seen to great effect in the opening of Midsummer Night’s Dream (★★★★☆), as the curtain rises on the dancers thrashing rhythmically in a golden wheat field. This midsummer night is not Shakespeare’s – although it shares some themes of intoxication, confusion and desire – but the annual Swedish festival where Ekman’s countrymen go all-out with the boozy celebrations (and the rolls in the hay are literal and metaphorical).One Swedish tradition has it that if you put seven flowers under your pillow that night, you’ll dream of your future spouse. Dragoș Mihalcea’s central character, The Dreamer (another one!) does just that, and we find ourselves in his unconscious in the wee hours, a place of off-kilter senses, secrets and intimacies, and a flock of women wearing only pointe shoes, boyfriend shirts and just-got-out-of-bed hair. More than Mihalcea, though, the person around whom this show orbits is goth-art-pop singer Anna von Hausswolff, wandering through the scenes. She has a voice that sees your soul: rich, pure and soaring in Kate Bush swoops over another haunting score from Karlsson.These ballets are available to watch on Marquee TV, part of a series of five works by Ekman.

Here’s how to buy everything from technology to beauty to books without itWith the shutters down on high streets and retail parks around the world, meaning that home delivery is the only option for almost anything other than food and medicine, it’s no surprise that Amazon is seeing business boom. The online retailer, already a one-stop shop for many people, has seen customers flock through its virtual doors in the weeks since coronavirus hit.The site is experiencing an extended period of sales at the level usually reserved for the shopping frenzy of Black Friday, with reported surges reaching $11,000 (£8,800) a second. Its share price is booming, too, making its already rich founder, Jeff Bezos, even richer.But while the site offers everything you could need at the moment, from food to films, via fish tanks and photo frames, there are many who feel uncomfortable about adding to its dominance. Concerns about its treatment of workers, how little tax it pays and its impact on smaller retailers are not new, but this crisis has shone the spotlight on them again.In the US, some Amazon workers are protesting against their treatment, accusing the company of putting revenue above safety by not supplying enough face masks or checking that employees are not sick when they turn up to work.In December, the UK campaign group Fair Tax Mark put Amazon at the top of a list of companies that it said were “aggressively avoiding” tax, saying it had paid just $3.4bn in tax on revenues of $960.5bn and profits of $26.8bn. With countries needing to rebuild their finances after the crisis, attention is likely to fall on corporations that are not seen to be paying their fair share.It is also worth remembering that however quick the delivery might be, it is not always as handy as being able to go to a shop and bring something home straight away. We will, one day, be back to that situation, so it is worth protecting your local retailers in the short term if you can. It is also worth looking for online alternatives.John Lewis is offering free standard delivery on orders over £50 or next-day delivery for £6.95. It is not offering two-person deliveries, and is calling ahead to check whether customers are self-isolating. Orders can be delivered to Waitrose, Co-op and Booths stores, too.It is worth seeing if independent retailers near you are still operating. In Carlisle, for example, @Home PC is advertising contact-free delivery on laptops and accessories.Depop is like eBay, but for trendy clothing and beauty products. The platform has listings from a range of inidual sellers and stores, and there are star ratings so you can choose to buy from trusted sellers. Purchases are protected by PayPal. It’s hard to avoid Amazon if you want to watch something that it has bought the rights for, but for films and music there are many other options.The BFI has new and classic films to rent on its website. One-off rentals start at £2.50 each, or a subscription offers older films. That costs £4.99 a month, but there is a 14-day free trial at the start.Curzon is offering the cinema experience at home, with very recent films such as Portrait of a Lady on Fire available to stream for less than £10. You don’t need to subscribe to watch, and there is a free film when you register your details.Cinema Paradiso has a wider range of films and TV programmes, but this is a DVD rental service so you can’t watch straight away. Again there is a 14-day free trial the monthly cost depends on which subscription you choose. The basic one is £5.99 and offers two rentals a month.HMV does most of its business online these days, too, and is another option if you don’t need to watch something straight away.Last week, Amazon was revealed to be the mystery donor of £250,000 to a fund to help bookshops suffering hardship. The organisers welcomed the gesture, while also noting that there was still “no greater threat to high-street bookselling” than the US giant.Books are in fact some of the easiest items to find a good alternative source for. Many independent shops are offering deliveries – a lot will order titles for you even if they don’t have them in stock. You can find local shops via the Booksellers Association’s website.For ebooks, there’s nowhere other than Amazon to buy Kindle versions, but there are other options. Many libraries, for instance, are offering loans online – check out your local council’s website for details. It is possible to convert ebooks bought elsewhere to Kindle’s format using free software such as Calibre.Through Indiebound, readers in the US can search for and buy from independent booksellers. You can search by zip code or store name – in case you are looking to support a particular store. Speed and cost of shipping depends on the bookstore.

The photographer, a Hungarian aristocrat who had given up a career as a diplomat to become a journalist, had based himself in the city after the war. Most often in this period – as a new book of his work, Paris, reveals – his camera dwelt on the lightness of the city as it reinvented itself: lovers dancing by the Seine, little visions of serendipitous comedy or grace in bars and cafes. The formal geometries of this photograph – which captures the Filles de la Charité of the order of St Vincent de Paul – is unusual in this work.Social distancing was, and is, a way of life for the nuns, popularly known as the “grey sisters”, who were required to take four annual vows of poverty, chastity and obedience in the service of the poor. The absence of shadow from the figures suggests that Almasy found his vantage to look into the courtyard at around noon, when the nuns were required to meditate and examine their consciences. The singular dress of the order, the white linen head-dress or cornette – prototype PPE – was established at the time of their foundation in the 17th century.In some ways, this photograph gave an indication of the future direction of Almasy’s work. Later that year, he became an official photographer for the United Nations, working in particular for the World Health Organization, for which over the following decades he produced hundreds of stories, capturing the success and failure of fighting disease across the globe. By the time of his death in 2003, aged 97, he had gathered an archive of 120,000 pictures, always using a diplomat’s discretion: “When I took photographs I never crouched down like a cat about to pounce on its prey,” he said. “I never attacked with my camera.” Paris by Paul Almasy is published in May (teNeues, £12.50)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aeb9f9759697bdd4ab8f4326c959646d73ef4da8/0_300_4960_2976/master/4960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1e26984e48b8b007f064d7abbdb5c6f","title":"postcard from future i dream of swimming berlins pristine lakes","story":"A short U-bahn ride from the German capital lie lakes, waterways and beaches that Rory MacLean can’t wait to swim in once againAt home in locked-down Dorset, I look out of my study window. Beyond the horizon I imagine launching myself on wild journeys: trekking Nepal’s high Annapurna trail or paddling a canoe across the dark mirror of a Canadian lake and leaving a trail of twisting whirlpools in my wake. In our changing new age, and with the need to limit long-haul air travel, I know that I’ll never reach many of my fancied, far afield destinations. Yet I’m determined to get back outdoors as soon as possible, starting in Berlin.To the west of the city – starting at the end of the U3 U-Bahn line – spreads a lattice of pristine lakes and waterways: urban Krumme Lanke and Schlachtensee, narrow Templiner See with dozens of intimate beaches, idyllic Lake Glienicke, which was once cut in half by the Berlin Wall.In the Havelseengebiet nature reserve, just south of Potsdam, water flows through the land like blood through a body. The rivers are the arteries the streams are the veins. In summer it is a place best discovered by bicycle: step off a train in Wannsee or Potsdam, pedal west along bankside cycle lanes and pine-needle paths, find a quiet cove, then plunge into the water.Around and about, dragonflies mate in mid-flight, their wings knocking the rushes to make a sound like licking flames. Water spiders skate over the surface like minute balls of mercury. Birch tree branches are reflected in the water.On my wished-for journey, lunch will be an alfresco picnic or – if I’m feeling flush – trout and chanterelles at the Fährhaus Caputh, overlooking the water from a deckside table. Of course today the Fährhaus is closed, as are all other restaurants. The beaches are empty. On top of Germany’s stringent lockdown restrictions, foreign citizens on “non-essential travels” are refused entry to the country. But once the borders are open again, I’ll be on my bike, and in that water, and out in the open air.Rory MacLean is a travel writer and historian.

Even Ina Garten, the Barefoot Contessa food mogul and a portrait of homey wholesomeness, is quaffing cosmos out of a super-sized martini glass: “It’s always cocktail hour in a crisis!” she quipped on Instagram.“We know that drinking can increase under stressful conditions – that’s well-documented in the literature,” said Dr Rajita Sinha, director of Yale University’s Interdisciplinary Stress Center. “But the broader question you have is: Is that okay? And I would be wary. I would ask, are there alternative ways to cope with stress that are healthier?”For Richard McGilvray, a condo building concierge in Buffalo, NY, drinking has only latterly become a way to deal with stress. But the 26-year-old, who said he “almost never drank” before the quarantine, has taken to downing three or four Labatt beers while he plays Animal Crossing with his pregnant girlfriend. Neither one can work remotely, and their “essential” jobs feel newly risky and precarious.“I’m just kind of trying to relax,” McGilvray said. “This could all be swept away from us.”Across the country, in Sonoma county, California, 28-year-old programmer Mary-Katherine McKenzie is more secure – but equally buzzed. Siloed in her boyfriend’s weekend home with two friends, McKenzie’s lockdown has at times felt like an “extended vacation”. The hours melt together it “always feels like Thursday,” she said.And because the old schedules and norms are no longer as rigid, drinking earlier in the day, or on weekday nights, no longer feels inappropriate. One US university professor, who asked not to be named because of his work, said he has watched some of his colleagues start drinking as early as 11.He himself has contemplated the goldmine of data this period will give social science researchers. It’s a great natural experiment, he said, of the type academics always hope for. How did these weeks of isolation – and the wave of liberalized alcohol norms they prompted – impact cancer rates? Liver disease? Domestic violence?Recently, the professor drank half a bottle of bourbon during a Zoom happy hour with some colleagues and friends.“I don’t feel like I’m becoming an alcoholic – I don’t crave it,” he said. “But as a social scientist, I do wonder: what is driving that?”Those sorts of questions are critical now, said Dr Priscilla Martinez, a scientist studying the health effects of drinking at the Alcohol Research Group, a federally funded research center. Heavy drinking is not good for human health, under any circumstances – and recent research by Martinez, Sinha and others has shown that alcohol disrupts the immune system and compromises the brain’s stress-coping mechanisms.Among many other conditions, people with alcohol use disorders are more likely to develop respiratory diseases. They’re also more likely to struggle with issues like relapse and bingeing in quarantine. The World Health Organization recently published guidance encouraging people to “minimize their alcohol consumption at any time, and particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic.”But Martinez hesitates to mandate that drinkers go cold turkey. That’s not realistic, she said. And usually light or social drinkers are unlikely to develop habits that outlast the pandemic. Instead, it’s important that people track when, why and how much they’re drinking, and whether that changes.“I think it’s good to acknowledge the total bizarreness of the situation we’re in,” Martinez said. “It’s unlikely this will be the rest of our lives. What we’re doing now doesn’t have to be permanent.”That said, “awareness of your own drinking is important”, she added.Fortunately, some pandemic drinkers have reached that conclusion, themselves. One American teacher in Shanghai said he poured out every bottle of liquor in his house after realizing his drinking had become destructive.Even Quarantined Beer Chugs – that pinnacle of pandemic inebriation – has lately adopted a different tone. In the interest of “encouraging healthy habits,” said 31-year-old group founder Andrew Beile, QBC now hosts thrice-weekly “hydration days” and uses the slogan “all chugs welcome”. Posters will occasionally chug milk or water next to the usual beer, wine and vodka.“It’s erted from just chugging beers,” Beile said. “Because I realized this could become a long bender.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c893a4163c53847ad9362754d38133804fac7777/0_72_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93ff1392808cb71f7d26e4383ea75b89","title":"tell us what are your experiences of private covid 19 testing centres coronavirus","story":"If you’ve used a private coronavirus testing centre, we’d like to find out what the service was like.

I had almost forgotten about that!”The family live in the flight path of Aberdeen airport and in more normal times, as well as frequent planes, they also endure regular helicopter flights to the region’s oil rigs – which have also dramatically reduced since the twin crises of coronavirus and oil prices struck. Shortly before spotting the plane, Chirnside says, he had been delighted to hear the call of a buzzard high above his garden for the first time.It is a sentiment that has been felt keenly across the country by those who live under flight paths, who find themselves unexpectedly able to breathe clean air, hear birdsong and – for many of the worst affected – sit in their own gardens. In the week before Britain went into lockdown, 7,865 flights departed the UK’s 10 biggest airports, according to a BBC analysis of flight data. During the week to 21 April, the number recorded by Flightradar24 was 711.For some, the change in their quality of life has been dramatic. “It’s blissful at the moment,” says Maggie Thorburn, who lives in Isleworth, west London, so close to Heathrow that at the worst times of the day planes usually scream over her home every 90 seconds, with constant air traffic from 4.30am until 11pm.So dominant is the noise from the airport, says Thorburn, that in normal times her decisions when to open her windows or sit in her garden are driven entirely by Heathrow’s flight schedule.With flight numbers down by two thirds, however, she is certainly sleeping better, “and I can hear things from further away – the church clock striking, and of course the birds. It’s not the same as being in the countryside, but it’s the next best thing. It really is a huge relief to be able to be home and have some peacefulness.”Of course, no one is pretending the clean air and relative quiet comes without a cost. While the national economy has been clobbered by the lockdown, the collapse in air travel means towns near airports are among the worst affected. Research by the Centre for Cities suggests that in Crawley, close to Gatwick, more than half of all jobs are vulnerable either to being furloughed or lost altogether – a dizzying speed of collapse that is entirely without precedent, according to Paul Swinney, the thinktank’s director of policy and research.“Of course, the hope would be that while the downturn is unprecedented the bounce back in theory will be very quick as well,” he says.However, for Thorburn, who is vice-chair of the group Hacan which campaigns against Heathrow expansion, a return to what once was considered normal is a prospect that provokes dread. “I have got used to not hearing the planes all the time. And when they come back – if they come back – I am not looking forward to business as usual.”With many airlines struggling even to survive, it is not clear when, if at all, air travel will return to its pre-coronavirus levels – though Swinney says he thinks flying is likely eventually to recover, because “there aren’t enough viable alternatives to flying to different places”.For Shaun Davidson, however, whose east London home lies in the flightpath of the closed London City airport, his newly quiet back garden has made him wonder whether it’s time to reexamine the compromises city dwellers make with aircraft noise.“It’s made me think more about how many flights people take and how many are necessary. We probably do travel more than we need to.” Is it really worth it, he says, when the alternative might be “to have clearer skies, a nicer environment around. Yes I guess I have started questioning that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d345022ca803439712ae318d5e0271bfaa8677e5/138_0_3292_1977/master/3292.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2782c81f7075e38c9830d3852ae92af","title":"the key areas to look at in easing the uk coronavirus lockdown","story":"From schools to shops, with jobs at risk, the government must balance the interests of economy and public safetyAs the prime minister, Boris Johnson, heads back to Downing Street, he faces calls from Labour to be clearer about how Britain might start lifting the coronavirus lockdown, now entering its fifth week. On Sunday, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, warned the outbreak remained at a “delicate and dangerous” stage and said it was irresponsible to speculate about steps to modify the rules underpinning government’s “stay home, protect the NHS, save lives” strategy.More than 20,000 people have died from Covid-19 in NHS hospitals and thousands more in care homes. But there are growing concerns about the economic impact of lockdown. Gerard Lyons, Johnson’s economics adviser when he was London mayor, warned on Sunday the UK could be the hardest-hit western economy if it does not unlock soon. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, also called on ministers to start talking to teachers, businesses, trade unions and town hall leaders and open “honest conversations with the public about what new arrangements might look like”. Unions insist worker safety must not be compromised by any changes and questions remain about public appetite for risking a new peak of contagion, but plans to modify restrictions are starting to emerge.One-way systems and plastic till barriers are among strategies to be used by retailers to reopen non-food stores. The DIY retailer Homebase tested the waters by reopening 20 of its stores on Saturday while the electronics retailer Dixons Carphone said it will launch “zero-contact” stores. Its Norwegian shops have remained open using contactless ordering and payment, prepaid pickups and increased cleaning and hygiene. This could be replicated in the UK, the firm said.Clothes shops could reopen, but with changing rooms off limits, according to guidelines published on Sunday by the British Retail Consortium. It has recommended store managers designate different entrances and exits and send shoppers through aisles in a one-way system to limit contact. Shopper numbers should also be restricted, promotional displays pared back to give customers more space and product demonstrations avoided to deter clustering. Tills will be shielded with plastic screens, as seen in some supermarkets, and floor markings in payment queues will keep customers two metres apart.Raab confirmed on Sunday that people arriving at ports and airports could be quarantined for 14 days as part of emerging plans to lift Britain out of its lockdown. Officials at the Home Office, which is responsible for border security, and the Department for Transport are reported to have drafted plans for 14-day “stay at home” notices, similar to those currently issued to Singaporean citizens returning from abroad. Such a rule would apply to foreign arrivals as well as UK citizens, with fines for failure to remain at the address given for isolation. Raab told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show: “Whether it is a quarantine period, or testing or other measures that might be taken, it is possible.”Ibstock, one of Britain’s biggest brick-makers, will restart production on Monday, and ministers appear keen for builders to catch up on time lost during the lockdown. Construction sites have been kept open since the 23 March lockdown, with physical distancing rules in place. Due to sickness and self-isolation, however, many contracts are well behind. Two of the UK’s biggest housebuilders, Persimmon and Vistry (formerly Bovid) are due to reopen sites on Monday, with Persimmon’s chief executive, David Jenkinson, saying the firm has “new site protocols that incorporate the necessary social distancing and protective measures”.Builders could be allowed to work through evenings and weekends, in temporary lifting of noise abatement rules, it was reported at the weekend. Planning conditions currently limit how late builders can work and tend to prohibit Sunday working.After the deaths of taxi drivers, care workers, nurses and doctors from Covid-19 picked up at work, trade unions are demanding that all employers produce risk assessments before lockdown is eased. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) said that two in five workers are concerned about not being able to phyiscally distance from colleagues, and more than a quarter are concerned about not being able to physically distance from customers or clients. Building workers organised by Unite said that because workers on housebuilding sites are mostly self-employed, enforcing health and safety guidelines will be difficult.“We need tough new measures from government to reassure working people that their health and safety is a priority,” said Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC. “Too many workers have already been forced to put their health on the line during this pandemic. We all want everyone to get back to work and start rebuilding Britain. But workers need confidence that they won’t have to put themselves or their families at unnecessary risk.”The headteachers union ASCL has said it does not think schools could reopen until 1 June at the earliest. The home secretary, Priti Patel, said at the weekend the government would not put a date on it because it would be “irresponsible and get hopes up”. Raab, said it would be “inconceivable” to send children back to school without physical distancing. This all points to schools being one of the later steps in any lockdown lifting.Labour is applying pressure though, with shadow cabinet member Rachel Reeves warning “young people are missing out on vital days and weeks and months of their education”. The Sutton Trust has found that two-thirds of pupils have not taken part in any online learning while at home, with independent school pupils more likely to be keeping up remotely. Social workers are concerned that the most vulnerable children will suffer most as the schools remain closed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb05e8efbab9daf99563fb4054ef86b80c7ccdc6/0_143_4676_2806/master/4676.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd8f67bded61000b8c710c56a60e2161","title":"24 hrs madrid emergency ambulance coronavirus photo essay","story":"Photojournalist Pablo García Sacristán spent a day and night with Madrid’s Summa crews, offering medical - and psychological – support to coronavirus patientsby Pablo García Sacristán in MadridAt 8am on a normal weekday, the streets of Madrid would be choked with traffic.But there’s been no such thing as a normal day in the capital for well over a month. Normality has long since disappeared in the fight against Covid-19, and the city’s main arteries are unclogged by cars.This makes life easier for the 29 specialised ambulances of the regional medical emergency service (Summa), which have traversed in and around the capital since mid-March, responding to a seemingly endless series of calls.Onboard one of the ambulances – callsign UV16 – is Dr Alonso Mateo, the assistant head of Madrid’s regional transplant coordination service. After setting up a makeshift hospital in a hotel and doing shifts at the huge field hospital at Madrid’s main convention centre, Mateo now forms part of a mobile crew. Alongside him are Marta Vivas, a nurse, and two technicians, Daniel Martínez and Miguel Collado, the latter of whom hs recently returned to work after being off for 20 days with coronavirus.“I’m not scared of it at all but I’ve got a healthy respect for it, and I want to do my bit when it comes to putting an end to this nightmare,” says Miguel.After coffee and a careful revision of their kit, the first call of the day comes in and they set off at full speed from their base in the working-class neighbourhood of Vallecas.On arrival, they suit up in their personal protective equipment. All cases must be treated as potential Covid-19, so overalls go on, along with gloves and masks. They dress with practised speed and efficiency.Inside, one of the technicians remains at the door as the designated “clean man”. It is his job to help his colleagues out of their gear when they emerge and disinfect their outfitsMateo has been an intensive care unit doctor for 15 years, “but it was only during the time of Ebola that we learned to put on isolation suits – even though we always carried them in the ambulances”.Things are different now, he adds: “For any kind of urgent job we use total isolation measures – and hardcore suits – for the patient’s protection, and for our own. A very high proportion of people who have caught the disease are health workers, and we just can’t do what we’re called on to do if those numbers stay as they are.”“Getting to someone’s house and being able to help them when they’re hanging between life and death is something money just can’t buy,” says Marta.But sadly – and as Dani points out – that’s not always the case.“Sometimes we have to watch as people die and there’s nothing we can do about it,” he says. “That’s really tough and something you just have to try to learn to live with. You just have to keep it together because there’s always someone who needs your help and you need to fight to save their lives.”Mónica Coll, the doctor on ambulance UV15 gets one such call mid-afternoon. She and the nurse, Guillermo Lago, arrive to find an elderly woman with breathing problems and a fever. Everything points to Covid-19 and there’s nothing that can be done.The pair treat the woman’s sister with enormous care and kindness, and, thanks to them, she watches her sister die with an uncommon serenity. They tell her that she died without any pain or suffering, and that that is the most important thing in the circumstances.On the other side of the door, UV15’s technician, Roberto Gonzalez and Javier García, are waiting. The report needs to be filled out before their colleagues can be disinfected.Even in times such as these, older people are scared of going to hospital because it means they will be on their own. They tend to leave it to the last minute, by which time it’s often too late.They fear the loneliness and the idea of being left to face their final moments alone. They also know that most of their relatives will not be able to come to their funerals either, because coronavirus has done away with the familiar norms – like going to hospital when you feel ill like knowing someone will be beside you when you die.And that is where the ambulance crews that tear across Madrid come in: it’s not just physical help they bring – it’s psychological support, too.Although the pace of the day is relentless things calm briefly when the team stops for dinner. They have 15 minutes for a salad and coffee before work resumes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9693ba08caedd42d50cd7ffc56b78d8fe53cbd2b/0_0_5349_3210/master/5349.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5c04e5f9517647c683d9a167cea9b8b","title":"coronavirus easing uk lockdown require tough enforcement rules","story":"Economist says strict measures needed to avoid pubs and shops getting too busyAn economist who has been advising the government over how to ease the national lockdown has said pubs, shops and restaurants could reopen as long as there was mandatory physical distancing and fines for those abusing the rules.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Speaking to the , Eyal Winter said ministers could allow a broader resumption of activity, but only if it was accompanied by a stricter level of enforcement.Winter said the Cabinet Office was deeply concerned that some people would behave inappropriately as soon as lockdown was ended. One fear was that pubs would get very full. “People are starving for pubs. They are an important part of British culture,” he said.Winter, an economist at Lancaster University, is part of a team of behavioural experts who have been advising the government since April.His views have been shared with ministers as they consider a range of options for how the UK might emerge from the coronavirus crisis.Winter said he opposed opening up the UK economy sector by sector. He has argued his blueprint would be more equitable than a gradual easing of restrictions, which could fuel resentment among those still unable to work.He said the government should follow a German-style approach, with clear dates and targets. “One of the most important things is to have a programme, to say, ‘in two weeks we will do such and such’,” he said. “You need to make the rules crystal clear, and to explain to the public the rationale behind each one of them.”He was sceptical that official “nudge” warnings would keep people out of bars, putting them at risk of getting the virus or unwittingly passing it to others. One solution would be for landlords to ration how much beer they serve, to two or three pints, he said. Customers would then be politely asked to go home.Landlords and shop owners should be tasked with enforcing these new rules and to monitoring customer numbers, he said.He envisaged theatres and cinemas would also reopen but sell half as many tickets as before, with gaps in seating. Prices could be raised to cover revenue shortfalls.A similar empty “middle-seat” policy was likely to be introduced on planes, he said. Travel would restart with a “low version of social distancing”. Winter was dismissive of Michael O’Leary, the boss of Ryanair, who last week said he wouldn’t bother flying his planes in this “idiotic” scenario. Winter pointed to the recent collapse in the global oil price. Restrictions “wouldn’t be for eternity”, he stressed.Some changes, such as the use of Zoom and other homeworking technologies, were good, he said. Overall, Winter said he was confident the world would eventually return to its pre-virus state. This would probably take two years, assuming the planet avoided future pandemics.“Some people have an apocalyptic view of this. I’m old enough to remember 911. We had exactly the same impression afterwards then. We thought: ‘It’s over. We will lock ourselves in shelters. We will stop flying.’ It never happened,” he pointed out. He added: “It will take a lot of time to move back to January 2020. But we will get there.”Winter – who is also a professor at the Hebrew University’s centre for the study of rationality – was speaking from his home between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. He has also been advising the government in Israel, where the death toll from coronavirus has been significantly lower than in the UK. He is due to hold further discussions on Tuesday with the Cabinet Office’s behavioural science group. The group feeds policy ideas to government. Not all are accepted, Winter said.Another prominent adviser to the Cabinet Office is Daniel Kahneman, the Israeli-American economist and Nobel laureate, celebrated for his work on the psychology of judgement and decision making. Kahneman declined to comment.Winter said that the group had discussed the gruelling psychological toll that lockdown was having on iniduals. Some were “taking more risks”. Others were experiencing high levels of anxiety, which left them open to being scammed or to going on irrational spending sprees.He predicted that crime and violence were likely to jump once the lockdown was over. He also anticipated a period of social ision, with grievances among those who felt they had suffered more than others. Branding some workers essential and others superfluous was unwise. This could leave citizens feeling they had been treated unfairly, he said.The Cabinet Office confirmed its team had spoken to Winter about exit lockdown strategy. It said the government sought advice from a wide range of experts including academics, healthcare professionals and business leaders.Boris Johnson has been reluctant to explain his thinking on how the lockdown might end. This is causing frustration among some Tory MPs, as well as to millions of workers who have seen their incomes evaporate. The UK’s position is increasingly anomalous: other European countries have revealed timetables for the reopening of schools and non-essential businesses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f5ea27fe3e9f7b80a4e35b39da080bb8086bff6/0_212_5209_3126/master/5209.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df8b15f12988a8031088b57862da9aca","title":"czech republic shops reopen as part of gradual coronavirus lockdown exit","story":"Country eases coronavirus measures after quick response helped it limit cases to 7,400Many shops outside shopping malls are reopening in the Czech Republic after the government brought forward its five-stage lockdown exit plan, amid reports that the British government is closely watching the country’s back-to-business strategy.Under increasing pressure to lift parts of the UK’s lockdown and limit the damage to the economy, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is understood to be studying the Czech Republic’s approach to lifting the tight restrictions it imposed earlier than most countries further west, which have helped it limit cases to 7,400, with just 221 deaths.Prague was one of the few governments to declare a state of emergency before the country had recorded its first coronavirus death. By 11 March it had closed all schools, limited public gatherings, banned all public events, sealed its borders and shuttered all non-essential stores. It also made face masks obligatory in public.Early this month it became the first European country to relax its restrictions, initially by allowing citizens to cycle, jog and walk in the countryside without wearing their masks, as long as they stayed 2 metres apart.Some sports facilities, such as tennis courts and golf courses, were allowed to reopen as long as no more than two people played together, and selected non-essential shops – including cycle stores, repair shops and hardware and DIY stores – also returned to business on 9 April.On 15 April the government unveiled a detailed five-step plan to reopen the broader economy, with the deputy prime minister, Karel Havlíček, iding businesses and activities into five main groups which would reopen their doors in stages over the following eight weeks.Craft shops, car dealerships and farmers’ markets were the first to reopen from 20 April, with smaller shops outside shopping malls scheduled to follow on 27 April, then larger shops outside malls, driving schools and fitness centres.The final stages were to happen in late May and early June, with restaurants allowed to serve customers outside, and hairdressers and beauty salons permitted to reopen, followed by shopping malls. Bars and restaurants were to be allowed to resume indoor service by 9 June, with hotels also allowed to reopen.Public amenities and meeting places, such as museums and galleries, as well as cultural venues including theatres, would be among the last facilities to reopen, while schools were to start returning from 11 May. Havlíček stressed that the government reserved the right to adjust its dates.As its infection curve continued to fall, however, the government last Thursday brought forward its exit plan, speeding up the process. Most venues are now to reopen two weeks earlier than initially planned, with gyms and all stores smaller than 2,500sq m outside shopping malls allowed to reopen on Monday.The five-stage plan is now a four-stage plan: outdoor restaurant and bar areas reopen from 11 May, along with hairdressers and beauty salons, with restaurants expected to resume indoor service and hotels allowed to reopen from 25 May, two weeks earlier than the previous 8 June date.The government also unexpectedly announced it would open its borders for outbound foreign travel after recording a decline in the number of infections. The health minister, Adam Vojtěch, said returning travellers would have to prove they were uninfected or spend 14 days in quarantine.Face masks will remain mandatory until the end of June, but restrictions are being eased on movement within the country, with groups of up to 10 now permitted to gather, compared with a previous limit of two.The full breakdown of the country’s lockdown exit plan is as follows:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1b2c3553474d308a6fc337769830896d9f1c3de/0_52_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47ea523ea4b61346c94b127e1cd265c7","title":"european leaders face pressure move faster easing lockdowns germany","story":"As some nations relax rules, others such as Germany are arguing about how far to goSwiss barbers are cutting hair again, Norwegian primary school children have returned to class, and many of the Czech Republic’s shopkeepers are back in business as governments across Europe continue to ease their coronavirus lockdowns.But, in other European countries, leaders are coming under growing pressure to move faster and Germany was locked in a row over how and when to lift restrictions amid concerns the country is in danger of gambling away its achievements so far.Over 3 million people have been infected by the coronavirus around the world and more than 208,000 have died, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The world’s worst pandemic in a century has forced governments into a dilemma.People confined to their homes for weeks are growing frustrated and anxious and, with economic activity all but dead, prolonged recessions are forecast in many countries. But with an antidote or vaccine yet to be found, leaders are also acutely aware of the danger of a second wave of infections.The Swiss stopped short of full lockdown in emergency measures introduced last month, but on Monday began the first of a three-stage lifting plan with doctors, dentists, nursery schools, hairdressers and massage and beauty salons permitted to reopen along with hardware stores, garden centres and florists.A week after it reopened its pre-schools, Norway sent its younger primary school pupils back to class – with a maximum of 15 in each, and many parents far from reassured – after a month and a half of remote learning from home.In the Czech Republic, which declared a state of emergency before its first Covid-19 death, a five-stage lockdown exit plan has been moved forward, allowing gyms and stores smaller than 2,500 sq metres outside shopping malls to reopen on Monday.The central European country’s detailed roadmap, which ides businesses and amenities into five – since reduced to four – categories according to the risk of new infections each poses, is understood to be being studied by the UK government.Croatia on Monday also began easing curbs, allowing smaller shops, libraries and museums to reopen, while Serbia permitted small businesses and food markets to open their shutters, eased an overnight curfew and allowed elderly people to venture outside three times a week. Romania said it would not extend the current state of emergency past 15 May, when people will be able to move around with documentation.Governments in other countries, however, are facing a more problematic path out of lockdown. Germany has so far limited its outbreak to fewer than 160,000 cases and just over 6,000 deaths, a far lower proportion than many countries.But having slowed the virus’s spread, many people believe its dangers have been exaggerated and the country should get back to work. Wolfgang Schäuble, an elder statesman and current president of the Bundestag lower house, said the social and economic costs of lockdown should be weighed against the need to save lives.“When I hear that protecting lives should come above everything else, I don’t think that is absolutely true,” Schäuble told Der Tagesspiegel. “The massive economic, social, psychological and other effects need to be weighed up,” he said. “To just bring everything to a halt for two years can also have horrific consequences.”The chancellor, Angela Merkel, warned last week that some of the country’s 16 states were moving too fast to ease physical distancing measures. Her words were echoed on Monday by the economy minister, Peter Altmaier.“As a person who believes in fact-based decisions, I recommend to all of us to proceed very carefully in order not to be forced into eventually rescinding these decisions to ease restrictions,” Altmaier told Deutschlandfunk radio.But although almost three-quarters of the German population said they supported the lockdown measures in a poll published on Friday and the popularity of Merkel’s government has leapt 10 points, frustration – and opposition – is beginning to mount.Germany’s most popular newspaper, Bild, on Monday accused Merkel of being “stubborn, pig-headed and bossy”, while the Green party has urged her to be even more cautious, and the far-right Alternative für Deutschland said an absolute shutdown was avoidable and people “must be given back their liberty”.In France, pressure on the president, Emmanuel Macron, is also increasing as his prime minister, Édouard Philippe, prepared to present on Tuesday long-awaited details of the country’s plan to emerge from lockdown from 11 May.France also plans to have more than 26m non-medical face masks available for purchase by the end of this week, the deputy finance minister, Agnes-Pannier Runacher, said on Monday.Spain’s nearly 47 million people have spent more than six weeks under one of the strictest lockdowns in the world, with only adults authorised to leave home to buy food and medicines or walk the dog. Authorities cautiously prepared further steps to loosen confinement on Monday after children were allowed to leave their homes for the first time in six weeks on Sunday, causing concern about crowds in some areas.Italy, which has the world’s third highest rate of coronavirus deaths at more than 26,000, will allow factories and building sites to reopen from 4 May and permit limited family visits as it prepares a staged end to Europe’s longest lockdown, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said at the weekend.Meanwhile, in the US, the White House cancelled its Monday press briefing on the coronavirus, following days of controversy resulting from Donald Trump’s comments about injecting disinfectant as a possible treatment for Covid-19. Trump has not attended the briefing since Friday, tweeting that the press conferences are “not worth the time \u0026amp effort”.There have been reports that the White House wants to refocus the briefings on reopening the economy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/853c569ba8287f13ffab2229193d4e7d5c6c812a/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3e5869d9b5b7935f9db2878d6df2885","title":"eu watered down report on chinese disinformation about covid 19","story":"Foreign policy chief urged to explain claims that report was altered under pressure from BeijingThe European Union’s foreign policy chief is facing questions over allegations that a report about Chinese disinformation over Covid-19 was watered down in response to pressure from Beijing.In a letter to Josep Borrell, the Dutch MEP Bart Groothuis calls for a “formal and full explanation to the European parliament” about the evolution of an EU report on disinformation, amid emerging evidence it was altered under Chinese pressure.The row escalated last week after the New York Times reported that EU officials had delayed and then rewritten  the report after China tried to block its release. “The Chinese are already threatening with reactions if the report comes out,” Lutz Güllner, head of communications at the EU foreign service, wrote to colleagues last Tuesday, in an email seen by the paper.The report was published on the EU’s monitoring website EU vs Disinfo on Friday. A survey of disinformation and misinformation about Covid-19 around the world, the report largely summarises and analyses publicly available information. It notes a “continued and coordinated push by some actors, including Chinese sources, to deflect any blame for the outbreak of the pandemic and highlighting bilateral assistance”, as well as “significant evidence of covert Chinese operations on social media”.Groothuis told the  that the EU appeared to have “caved in on substance”, as he said an earlier version of the report had provided details of false Chinese government claims. For instance, he said, it reported untrue claims from China that 80 French politicians had signed a statement using a racist slur to denigrate the head of the World Health Organization.Groothuis, a former analyst at the Dutch ministry of defence, said it was extremely important for the EU’s senior management to back independent factual analysis. “China will become stronger, more prosperous and powerful, also militarily. It won’t be the last time they will try to intervene in internal politics of the EU.” He said it was time for the EU to send a clear signal: “If this is true, this can’t happen again in the future.”Borrell, an outspoken former Spanish foreign minister, said last month that Europe needed to defend itself in the “global battle of narratives” over Covid-19, amid “a struggle for influence through spinning and the ‘politics of generosity’”.The EU’s latest disinformation report, covering 2-22 April, is equally concerned by false claims and conspiracy theories from Kremlin-backed media. It states that “Russia and – to a lesser extent – China, have continued to widely target conspiracy narratives and disinformation both at public audiences in the EU and the wider neighbourhood”. Last month a leaked EU report concluded that pro-Kremlin media had been spreading disinformation with the aim of “aggravating” the public health crisis in the west."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d9acd40663c33ffbe7abb9d562a9f4e9ab11cd5/126_0_3348_2010/master/3348.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c44b936e12240b5c9a3f24ab2ae03dde","title":"giant new russian cathedral glorifies putin stalin mosaics","story":"Crimea annexation also exalted in Moscow church due to open on anniversary of 1945 victoryRussia is planning to open a huge cathedral with mosaics depicting Vladimir Putin and Joseph Stalin, as well as the annexation of Crimea, on the 75th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany next month.The mammoth structure will be one of the world’s tallest Orthodox cathedrals when it opens in the military’s Patriot Park outside Moscow on 9 May .Largely, the Resurrection of Christ Cathedral is a monument to the Soviet victory in the second world war.

The First deputy prime minister Dmitry Medvedev is elected in his stead. One of his earliest moves is to appoint Putin as prime minister, leaving little doubt that the two men plan, at the very least, to run Russia in tandem.Putin moves to cement his hold on power, backing a proposed constitutional amendment that would allow him to seek another two terms in the Kremlin.One of the mosaics, first revealed by the MBKh News website, depicts Putin, Sergei Shoigu, the defence minister, Alexander Bortnikov, the head of the Federal Security Service, and other top brass walking among a sea of Russians bearing tricolour flags. Also in the crowd appear to be Valery Gerasimov, a prominent Russian general, and Sergey Aksyonov, the current head of Crimea installed by Putin.A missing panel photographed separately shows several women in front of a sign that reads “Crimea is ours”.Andrey Kuraev, an archdeacon, wrote: “It’s like a guilty plea to The Hague. If an icon with the conquest of Crimea is placed in an army cathedral, that means the army played a decisive role in this operation.”Church officials confirmed the leaked pictures, saying it was custom to include real figures in church mosaics.“There has always been this tradition, when historical scenes are depicted from one period or another. It’s understood that one of these meaningful events was the accession of Crimea. The leading members of the government, who will be depicted here, took part in that accession,” Bishop Stefan, the head of the cathedral, told the business newspaper RBC.Another mosaic depicts the 1945 parade following the victory over Nazi Germany, with a crowd of soldiers standing in front of the Kremlin and a banner bearing a portrait of Stalin. It is one of his first appearances on a state building since the 1960s.“They are holding a poster with Stalin, but he isn’t among the marshals of the victory, despite being the commander in chief,” the artist who made the mosaics told the Novaya Gazeta newspaper.Putin has reacted carefully to public revelations about the mosaics. A spokesman said on Sunday: “When he was told about this, he smiled and said: ‘Someday our thankful descendants will appreciate our merits, but it’s too early to do so now.’”On Monday evening the church said it would engage its arts committee to review the mosaic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc56e80bbf86f992928b9bb6df7aaa5311e7ea84/0_0_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6886f26cb86f9ec85930751300b9516b","title":"halt destruction nature worse pandemics top scientists","story":"Exclusive: only one species is responsible for coronavirus – humans – say world’s leading wildlife expertsThe coronavirus pandemic is likely to be followed by even more deadly and destructive disease outbreaks unless their root cause – the rampant destruction of the natural world – is rapidly halted, the world’s leading bioersity experts have warned.“There is a single species responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic – us,” they said. “Recent pandemics are a direct consequence of human activity, particularly our global financial and economic systems that prize economic growth at any cost. We have a small window of opportunity, in overcoming the challenges of the current crisis, to avoid sowing the seeds of future ones.”Professors Josef Settele, Sandra Díaz and Eduardo Brondizio led the most comprehensive planetary health check ever undertaken, which was published in 2019 by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). It concluded that human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating decline of the Earth’s natural life-support systems.In an article published on Monday, with Dr Peter Daszak, who is preparing the next IPBES assessment, they write: “Rampant deforestation, uncontrolled expansion of agriculture, intensive farming, mining and infrastructure development, as well as the exploitation of wild species have created a ‘perfect storm’ for the spillover of diseases.”“Future pandemics are likely to happen more frequently, spread more rapidly, have greater economic impact and kill more people if we are not extremely careful about the possible impacts of the choices we make today,” they said.The scientists said the multitrillion-dollar economic recovery packages being rolled out by governments must be used to strengthen and enforce environmental protection: “It may be politically expedient to relax environmental standards and to prop up industries such as intensive agriculture, airlines, and fossil-fuel-dependent energy sectors, but doing so without requiring urgent and fundamental change essentially subsidises the emergence of future pandemics.”A global “One Health” approach must also be expanded, they said. “The health of people is intimately connected to the health of wildlife, the health of livestock and the health of the environment. It’s actually one health,” said Daszak.Furthermore, surveillance programmes and health services need to be properly funded in nations on the frontlines of pandemic risk, they said: “This is not simple altruism – it is vital investment in the interests of all to prevent future global outbreaks.”Daszak said: “The programmes we’re talking about will cost tens of billions of dollars a year. But if you get one pandemic, even just one a century, that costs trillions, so you still come out with an incredibly good return on investment.“Business as usual will not work. Business as usual right now for pandemics is waiting for them to emerge and hoping for a vaccine. That’s not a good strategy. We need to deal with the underlying drivers.”In March, the UN’s environment chief, Inger Andersen, told the  “nature is sending us a message” with the coronavirus pandemic and the ongoing climate crisis. She said failing to take care of the planet meant not taking care of ourselves.“It is the consequence of our persistent and excessive intrusion in nature and the vast illegal wildlife trade, and in particular the wildlife markets, the wet markets, of south Asia and bush meat markets of Africa,” he said. Earlier in April, a major study found that the human impact on wildlife was to blame for the spread of viruses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/513d86d76d323aa776b9589b2e2f0f4a9d5544b5/286_0_1797_1078/master/1797.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d5d0be244d26969846fc3c908be2db4","title":"ministers meet unions and business to plan getting uk back to work","story":"Talks aimed at bringing in practices that reassure employees it is safe to leave lockdownMinisters have held a series of high-level meetings with trades unions and business leaders amid fears that millions of people will be too fearful to return to work as pressure intensifies on the government to publish a path out of the national lockdown. has been told that both sides of industry have been drafted into seven sector-by-sector meetings chaired by the business secretary, Alok Sharma, in recent days – after concerns arose in Whitehall that many employees may be reluctant to return to the workplace, even when the government gives the green light.Measures under discussion include the use of face masks and hand sanitiser on public transport, one-in-one-out rules and socially distanced queues for non-essential shops, and revised operating procedures for building sites. Some construction projects halted as a result of the virus have already restarted.Boris Johnson urged Tory colleagues pressing for an immediate end to the lockdown to “contain your impatience” in a Downing Street address on his first day back at work on Monday, as the UK coronavirus hospital death toll passed 21,000.The prime minister said the country now had the opportunity to overcome Covid-19, but was at the “moment of maximum risk”. But he also pledged to “fire up the engines of this vast UK economy” as soon as it is safe to do so.No 10 previously had little time for either business groups such as the CBI – which it regarded as a hotbed of remainers – or the trades unions.Yet, since the onset of the crisis, both groups have been closely involved in drawing up chancellor Rishi Sunak’s economic rescue package – and they are now helping to prepare the ground for what Johnson called the “refining” of lockdown restrictions.While Tory donors and backbenchers have been calling for economic activity to resume as soon as possible, polling suggests strong support for lockdown measures remains, and government insiders pointed to so-called “over-compliance” with the restrictions already in place.Getting schools up and running again – and persuading parents their children will be safe – is regarded by ministers as a necessary precondition for allowing many people to return to work. Schools are not expected to reopen fully until June, after the spring half-term.In a characteristically upbeat statement delivered outside Downing Street two weeks after he was discharged from hospital following intensive care treatment for coronavirus, Johnson compared the virus to “an unexpected and invisible mugger”.“This is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle it to the floor and so it follows that this is the moment of opportunity. This is the moment when we can press home our advantage. It is also the moment of maximum risk,” he said.He said it was too soon to say when the lockdown measures would be altered. Addressing those calling for an early lifting of the restrictions, he said: “I entirely share your urgency. It’s the government’s urgency and yet we must also recognise the risk of a second spike the risk of losing control of that virus.“That would mean not only a new wave of death and disease but also an economic disaster and we would be forced once again to slam on the brakes across the whole country and the whole economy, and reimpose restrictions in such a way as to do more and lasting damage.”The government’s scientific advisers are working to model the potential impact on R0 – the infection rate of the virus – of lifting different restrictions. The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said on Monday it was not yet clear how much difference reopening schools would make, for example.He said the Sage committee of scientists, of which he is a member, would present ministers with estimates of the impact of various measures in the coming days – allowing the politicians to make decisions of how to adjust the lockdown.Echoing the language used by Dominic Raab, deputising for the prime minister, on Sunday, Johnson said the government would “refine” the stringent distancing restrictions imposed on 23 March, which are due to be reviewed by Thursday next week.Conservative campaign chief Isaac Levido is involved in the task of replacing the government’s “Stay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives” slogan with a more nuanced message for what Johnson repeatedly called the “second phase” of the crisis.Sunak disclosed on Monday that 4m workers had been furloughed under the government’s unprecedented job retention scheme, in which the taxpayer underwrote the costs of paying staff wages as they are temporarily laid off.Johnson stressed his determination to build a consensus over future measures, saying he would include opposition parties in his deliberations.Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has so far adopted a cautiously supportive approach to the government’s handling of the crisis, while pressing ministers on specific issues including testing and the availability of personal protective equipment for frontline health workers.Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: “Protecting workers’ safety and rebuilding the economy must go hand in hand.“That’s why we have called on government to set up a national recovery council with unions and employers. Any business that refuses to put in place safe systems of work should face the threat of prosecution.”The health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced on Monday that some hospital treatment halted because of the virus, including cancer care, will now be progressively resumed. Presenting the daily Downing Street press conference, Hancock stressed that the NHS remained open, and urged the public to continue to make use of it as usual.Ministers are concerned that while it has suppressed Covid-19 cases, the lockdown is creating its own risks to public health because people are anxious about going to hospital with other conditions.“Our message is that the NHS is open: help us to help you,” Hancock said.

It dispatched 122 military doctors, personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators and mobile disinfection machines on cargo planes from Moscow.The Nato general Tod Wolters said this month that he was chiefly concerned about the presence of Russian military staff in Italy. “It is of concern. I pay very close attention to Russian malign influence,” he said.The aid gesture, accompanied by the message “From Russia with love”, has been branded by observers as propaganda.Lorries emblazoned with both countries’ flags and the aid slogan were broadcast on Russian state TV as they made the long journey from a military base near Rome to Bergamo, the province most severely affected by the coronavirus outbreak.In a further embarrassment, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said at a press conference that the request had come from the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, whose requests for essential aid from other EU member states had been rebuffed. Conte’s office did not respond to questions from the  about the aid.Andrea Armaro, a former spokesperson at Italy’s defence ministry, said Russia was “playing to weaken Europe and Italy”. He questioned the need for Russian military medics to disinfect areas when there were already nuclear, biological and chemical military teams in Italy capable of doing the job.“It was the largest and most successful propaganda operation carried out in a Nato territory at practically zero cost. I hope someone in Washington and Brussels wakes up before it’s too late.”As Russia’s own outbreak has intensified, so too have domestic questions about aid shipments. During a conference call on Monday last week, Putin defended deliveries to Italy and the US, calling them “not just a one-way street”.Russia analysts said there were some straightforward motivations for the foreign aid campaign, including diplomatic interests and the possibility of garnering return aid at a later date.“No country does humanitarian assistance purely because of the kindness of its heart,” said Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russian politics and security, adding that Russia was interested in currying favour with the Italians and framing a new narrative about its partnership with Europe. “We’re all in this together, which obviously can be used to chip away at sanctions.”A Kremlin spokesman denied that the aid was aimed at getting EU sanctions on Russia lifted, saying there was no discussion of “conditions or hopes or expectations”.Galeotti said it was possible that military intelligence operatives would have joined the mission in Italy “out of the habitual security mindset inside of Russia”. But he said their presence would be “frankly irrelevant, because there’s nothing really secret about this effort”.An analyst with ties to the defence ministry also said it was possible that members of Russian military intelligence would have joined the trip. But the mission’s main goal, he believed, would have been gathering as much information as possible about the virus and what methods were effective in fighting it to be prepared for the coming wave of infections at home.“This was the time to gather information,” said the analyst, who asked not to be named. “Because the military knows that when the situation gets bad in Russia, Putin is going to send them to fight it here too.”The fact that Conte requested “complete aid”, which he knew would include military medics, might not bode well for Italy, particularly as it battles for financial aid from the EU.“Italy is reaching out to authoritarian powers and, ultimately, the company you keep is going to be an issue,” said Francesco Galietti, the founder of Policy Sonar, a Rome-based political consultancy.“The question has to be raised as to whether you can flirt with everyone as you please, or if there is an etiquette, because if there is an etiquette then Italy is bluntly violating it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db5250559178d652bec1f121473a888c430b4664/0_148_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5a22e8a264b75797d1769c5bb440169","title":"over 70s have you been shielding yourselves from coronavirus at home","story":"If you are over 70-years-old and living in the UK, we’d like to know how you feel about the current situation – and the futureWe would like to hear from over-70s who have been staying at home to shield themselves from coronavirus.More than five weeks ago, the government told over-70s to be particularly stringent in following physical distancing measures – especially for those with underlying health conditions – and to limit face-to-face interactions to family and friends.Many have not left their homes since then, and even before.

If they do not, it will be read out on their behalf at the press conference. The exact details of how YouGov will select a single question remains unclear, although there are no qualifications required beyond being over-18 and stating where in the country you live.The enormous audiences for the daily press conferences, for which more than 8 million people tune in on television alone, have also focused attention on the journalists asking the questions, with government supporters using recent polling to claim their inquiring tone is alienating audiences.A No 10 spokesperson explained the decision to give a question to a member of the public: “We know people across the UK are making significant sacrifices everyday in order to stay at home, protect the NHS, we recognise the huge disruption this is having on their lives, jobs and businesses so it’s absolutely right the public get a chance to put their questions on the virus, and the measures we put in place, directly to the government and its experts.“The government is not involved in choosing the questions. That is done by an independent polling firm.”In recent weeks, Downing Street’s relationship with the media, which had improved enormously during the early part of the crisis as No 10 realised the importance of getting a clear message out to the public, has worsened following a series of critical reports.Ministers issued lengthy rebuttals to articles in the Sunday Times and Financial Times, while also attacking the ’s recent reporting on the presence of Dominic Cummings at a key scientific advisory meeting.The much-repeated slogan urging people to “Stay at home, Save Lives, Protect the NHS” is also under review ahead of a relaxation of the lockdown, according to the Sunday .Analysis by the  suggests ministers and scientific advisors have reduced their use of the mantra in government press conferences from an average of seven mentions to three since the start of April.

The team employed machine-learning algorithms, together with data from the 2.7 million app users – many of whom have been tested for coronavirus – to work out the combination of symptoms that indicate an inidual is likely to have Covid-19.The team then focused on data from just over 2,600 twins to try to establish whether the symptoms experienced by those predicted to have Covid-19 was related to genetic makeup.More specifically, the team found a substantial genetic influence for the symptoms of fever, diarrhoea, delirium, and losses of taste and smell. By contrast, a hoarse voice, a cough, skipped meals, chest pain, and abdominal pain were not linked to genetic makeup.Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.“This disease is very weird, the way it has a very different presentation in the population in different people – what we are showing is that isn’t random,” Spector said. “It is not mainly due to where you live or who you have seen a lot of it is something innate about you.“I think you can say that your likelihood of getting it at all, or getting it severely, is under some genetic control.”The team hopes the findings will help scientists ascertain the mechanisms by which Covid-19 acts on the body, as well as offering a possible way to predict those most at risk from the disease.They say the results could also help researchers around the world identify genetic variants that play a role in explaining why some iniduals show no, or only mild, symptoms of Covid-19, which could in turn aid the development of drugs for the disease.But there were other possible targets, Spector said, noting that genetics were closely linked to the immune system and microbes found in the gut.“It reassures everyone that it is worth exploring this whole triangle of genes, immune system and gut microbes,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f97887398fd43c5aa392e4e246f1369b8e4c03ef/0_291_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b13b5d3f1e9eab490c95a2264f1635de","title":"sunshine therapy bikes and a postmark for captain tom","story":"Recovering Covid-19 patients enjoy the weather while Royal Mail pays tribute to NHS fundraising heroWith lockdown looking likely to continue for the foreseeable, people are going that extra mile to bring joy to the lives of others – through dance, bicycles or simple sunshine.Staff at Queen’s hospital in Romford, Essex, took time out over the weekend to wheel two recovering Covid-19 patients outside in their beds to enjoy the sunshine.“This recovering Covid-19 patient was taken outside by staff to receive one of the greatest therapies available to us, the sun!” said Barking, Havering and Redbridge university hospitals NHS trust as it posted the image.Patrick Thoeung, Sharon McLoughlin, Mari Fantocchi and Katie Hayes, from the physiotherapy team, took the two patients outside on Saturday.“We felt very privileged to be part of our patients’ rehab and recovery,” said McLoughlin.As of Monday, Royal Mail will stamp all letters with a message to celebrate the 100th birthday of Capt Tom Moore, the war veteran who has raised millions for the NHS.He becomes a centenarian on Thursday, and all stamped post up until Friday will be marked with: “Happy 100th Birthday Captain Thomas Moore NHS fundraising hero 30th April 2020.”Royal Mail said it was “honoured” to introduce the special postmark for Moore, whose fundraising total reached £29m on Monday morning.More than 125,000 birthday cards have already been sent to Moore, and a Royal Mail spokesman said sorting machines at the South Midlands mail centre have been adapted to re-route all the cards into a dedicated collection box.Hundreds of bikes abandoned at railway stations are to be renovated and donated to key workers to help them get to and from work during the lockdown.Every month about 20 abandoned bikes arrive at Southern Rail’s maintenance depot in Horsham, Sussex, where they are stored in case owners decide to recover them.Govia Thameslink Railway, which runs Southern Rail, has teamed up with Handlebars, a bicycle repair service which will renovate the bikes and supply them to key workers free of charge.Andre Noble, a mechanic at Handlebars, has assessed all 272 bikes.He said: “We have seen a tonne of bikes in various conditions ...

Downing Street has played down their involvement, saying they are largely silent observers.However, others on Sage have said they were shocked, concerned and worried about the impartiality of advice when they discovered No 10 political advisers would be taking part.Vallance told journalists on Monday he was strongly advised to keep the Sage membership secret to ensure the independence and personal security of the scientists on the group. The membership of Sage differs for each emergency and has varied from meeting to meeting during the coronavirus outbreak.Historically, the names of the advisers had been published after a crisis had ended, he said, adding it was unclear when that point would be reached in dealing with the coronavirus. “I believe we should be more prepared to publish names sooner, and intend to do so shortly,” he said. “We will be publishing the names of those that are happy to have their names published.”The number of named advisers is expected to reach 100 iniduals. Twenty or so sit on Sage, with the rest participating in formal sub-groups or ad hoc teams set up to investigate particular issues.The sub-groups include 45 people on the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M) and 18 on the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (Spi-B). Others come from the Covid-19 clinical information network and the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag).Vallance said Sage had met 28 times since its first meeting on 22 January, with early meetings flagging the need to increase testing and the potential for the virus to spread through hospitals and care homes. Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Vallance said there was interest in the Sage meetings across Whitehall from early on. Many people were listening in from “various departments”, but they were not part of the general discussion. “That does include people from No 10 and, yes, occasionally they ask questions.”Political advisers from Downing Street have never attended Sage meetings before, according to a review of all publicly available minutes of meetings over the last decade.Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser, said he would not have allowed political advisers to attend his advisory meetings.“Dominic Cummings has the ear of the prime minister, so who is informing the prime minister about scientific advice?” he asked. “Is it Cummings or is it the chief scientific adviser? Suddenly you get a confusion. There must be a single voice taking the view of the scientific community to the prime minister, that is the most important thing.”Vallance said he had “no way of knowing” whether Cummings was sharing his own interpretations of Sage discussions with Johnson. “All I’m worried about is that the prime minister hears Sage advice from me. I can’t tell who else he is hearing scientific advice from.”At a briefing in Edinburgh, Sturgeon said the exclusion of scientists from the devolved administrations from Sage had prompted her to set up her own panel of advisers. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments do not have full membership of Sage.Sturgeon said she felt some time ago this policy meant she was unable to directly question or test the scientific and technical advice being presented, undermining her ability to find the right policies for Scotland.That situation improved, she said, when she appointed Prof Andrew Morris, a Sage member and a medical data scientist at the University of Edinburgh, to lead a Scottish science advisory group that reports directly to her. Morris is also the part-time chief scientific adviser to the Scottish government’s health department.“We now have a situation where the chair of the advisory group here in Scotland does participate fully in Sage, and that has helped to, I think, deal with a deficiency that I certainly felt was there at the outset,” Sturgeon said during her daily coronavirus briefing.She said the new advisory group allowed her to “augment” the high quality and “very helpful” advice from Sage. Sturgeon said she had to have the “ability as first minister, as the chief decision-maker in the Scottish government, to interrogate directly some of that advice and to have somebody that I could ask questions of, so that my understanding of it is as it needs to be, and that wasn’t, I felt, the case earlier on with Sage.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a4cd5829f4f1083d7fe633997c20b86982eb391/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e7c0122e3e6e41bbad375f9891c42ae","title":"wales ready to lift coronavirus lockdown","story":"Devolved UK nations may begin to chart different path out of Covid-19 crisis The first minister of Wales has said he is ready to move the country out of lockdown earlier than the rest of the UK as he demands more contact from ministers at Westminster.Mark Drakeford said he would rather work with Boris Johnson’s government but has the power to start enacting his own plan to ease restrictions if he thinks it is in the best interest of Wales.The Labour politician has been in regular talks with his Scottish counterpart, Nicola Sturgeon, and both countries have now released their own roadmaps to easing lockdown. Johnson said on Monday that he would release more details of his response to the lockdown in the “coming days”.In an interview with the , Drakeford said the Coronavirus Act 2020 allows the devolved nations to go their own way and it may now be time to consider putting that into action. “We have the power to do it, definitely. I’d rather we did it together. If we can’t get to that point and we think there are things that are right to do for Wales then we will go ahead and do that but my ambition is that we do things still together across the United Kingdom.“The Coronavirus Act does respect devolution. It puts the solution in our own hands and we have already done things differently in a range of different matters where that’s been right for us,” he said.Wales was the first nation to offer testing to hospital staff and postpone routine operations. The Welsh government has also put into law the two-metre social distancing rule, which is government advice in England.Drakeford said the government needed to step up its contact with the leaders of the devolved nations and has requested Michael Gove, the de facto deputy prime minister, speak with them early this week and then invite them to a Cobra meeting before the weekend.That “rhythm” of contact is essential, he said, with his last conversation with Gove was more than 10 days ago.Johnson said on Monday that he would be reaching out to build a consensus across the country and with opposition parties as the government tries to win “phase two” of the crisis, although no details of what that would entail have been released.Drakeford said the first changes he would implement in the “red phase” would not look very different to the lockdown and would be cautious and careful and their consequences well mapped out.Already in Wales, shops are able to open if they can use a click and collect system, and people can exercise twice a day if there is a medical reason to do so. Drakeford denied he was undermining a UK-wide response, saying his plans could and should contribute to what is being worked on in Westminster.A row over whether people can continue to stay in their second homes in Wales during the lockdown period ignited over the weekend when it was claimed wealthy second home owners were claiming business grants from their Welsh address.However Drakeford told the BBC that banning people from their second homes was a “very draconian” response and he was not sure it was a legal position they could back up and might have human rights implications.

Lagos and Ogun states, and the federal capital territory of Abuja, entered lockdown to halt the spread of the virus on 30 March.The US House of Representatives’ foreign affairs committee launches an investigation into Donald Trump’s decision to block World Health Organization funding, giving the state department a week to provide relevant information.Writing to the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, the committee’s chairman says he would support reform of the “imperfect” UN health agency, but cutting its funding “while the world confronts the Covid-19 tragedy is not the answer”.Officials say they have detected no unusual movements in North Korea and caution against reports that Pyongyang’s leader, Kim Jong-un, may be ill or is being isolated because of coronavirus concerns.The national public health emergency team will not recommend easing its lockdown next Tuesday unless progress on the spread and impact of the virus is made this week, the chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, says.Some countries have announced such measures and Holohan raised hopes Ireland would join them next week when he said on 16 April the country had contained the first wave of the outbreak.The country bans all commercial flight ticket sales until September one of the toughest such measures in the world. While its borders have been closed since March, the new decree goes further by banning the sale and purchase of commercial flights to, from and within Argentina. Industry figures claim it will put too much strain on airlines and airports.Postponements to 14 vaccination campaigns because of the pandemic will affect more than 13m people, the World Health Organization says.The WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, says vaccination drives against polio, measles, cholera, human papillomavirus, yellow fever and meningitis have not gone ahead.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, says 21,092 have now died in UK hospitals, as he announces 360 more deaths at the government’s daily briefing.

Photograph: iStockThe Skylon Hotel in Dublin has indicated to TDs that it plans to reopen on May 5th, and offered elected representatives a special discounted rate to mark the occasion.The current restrictions on travel and business operations are set to expire on that date, although recent indications from public health experts are that a widespread relaxation of the measures is unlikely.In an email sent to TDs on Monday, the hotel’s sales and marketing manager said that “as and from May the 5th the Dublin Skylon will reopen its doors to the public”.“I would like to offer you and your colleagues a preferential rate of 20 per cent off for any overnight stays pending availability,” the TDs were told. The hotel is owned by the Brian McEniff Hotel Group, which is itself owned by the former Donegal Gaelic football player and manager of the same name.Protect jobs“We will have very strict guidelines in place to ensure the health and safety of both our guests and staff members,” the email said. A source in the hotel group said that the group’s objective is to protect jobs among its employees, and added that any actions taken would be in adherence with whatever measures are outlined by the Government this week.The strict measures, which prohibit travel for most people beyond a 2km radius of their homes, also severely curtailed the operation of hotels around the country. Since late March, hotels have only been allowed to open for “essential services”.Between the restrictions on their business and the almost total absence of leisure and business travel, many hotels around the country have temporarily closed their doors. Dalata, the largest hotel company in the State, has closed 29 of its 44 hotels in Ireland and Britain, including the landmark Gibson in Dublin’s docklands.Indications are that the Government may be slow to relax measures that expire on the bank holiday weekend. Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan has said he was concerned about public complacency setting in and said that it was still not safe to lift any restrictions.Asked about the possible lifting of restrictions after May 4th, Dr Holohan on Monday night said he was “more firmly of the view” against recommending this than he had been last week. He pointed to a small but persistent increase in admission of patients to ICU, the overall number of cases and ongoing issues related to nursing homes and other long term residential care facilities.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4239395.1588018412!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus lockdown expected to continue beyond may 5th","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLiz Canavan, assistant secretary to the Department of the Taoiseach, appealed to people to continue to observe the lockdown.  ‘For now we just need to keep going as best we can.’  Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsSenior Government figures have warned that any easing of restrictions next week will be minimal, despite expected improvements in the rate of infections, deaths and hospital admissions this week.Ministers will be briefed at this week’s Cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning not to expect any substantial relaxation of the lockdown measures when they lapse after the forthcoming bank holiday weekend.Instead, new orders mandating a continuation of the lockdown will be signed this weekend, with the Government likely to make the announcements after a special Cabinet meeting next Friday.However, Ministers and public health officials are likely to set out a roadmap for the eventual easing of the restrictions, with separate phases – each involving a greater opening-up of economic and social life – taking place throughout the summer, assuming targets for the suppression of the virus are met.The high-level group of public health experts is to meet on Tuesday and again on Friday to discuss easing the restrictions, while the Cabinet sub-committee on Covid-19 will meet on Wednesday.Senior sources said that testing capacity would be increased over the coming weeks, which would allow greater relaxation of the lockdown – but only if deaths, ICU admissions and new infections continued to fall.“We have sufficient testing capacity to ease the restrictions, but not to lift them completely,” said one source. “But we wouldn’t be lifting them completely anyway.”RegimeAnother person briefed on the Government’s plans warned that the regime next week would not be all that different to the regulations in place this week.However, there is growing concern in Government about diminishing public tolerance for the lockdown.On Monday, a senior official in the Department of the Taoiseach admitted that the public’s “patience and resolve” to comply with Covid-19 restrictions is “waning”. She appealed to people to “keep going as best we can”.Liz Canavan was speaking at the daily Covid-19 briefing at Government Buildings, where she expressed concern at reports on social media “that some people are getting very fed up of the social distancing measures”.“They’re feeling confined, they’re stuck in the house or local area, and they’re having to queue to get into shops. We do know how frustrating it is, and we know people’s patience and resolve is waning,” she said.But she appealed to people to continue to observe the lockdown. “This is what is required of each and everyone of us at each step to delay the transmission of Covid-19. We know that call has not fallen on deaf ears so far... For now we just need to keep going as best we can,” Ms Canavan said.Later, asked if the Government wished to dampen expectations of the restrictions being relaxed next week, Ms Canavan said they were guided by the public health advice in the first instance, and the Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan had previously issued the same message. It is not yet clear what actions would be taken next week, she indicated.DangerHowever, she said that the Government was very conscious of “anticipatory behaviour”, where “people get ahead of where we need to be”. There is a danger that people will expect relaxation of the restrictions next week, and will begin to reduce their observation of social distancing over the coming weekend, she warned.Ms Canavan also supplied updated figures on the people in receipt of State supports due to Covid-19.Almost 50,000 employers are now availing of the wage support scheme for almost 350,000 workers.In addition, 591,000 people are in receipt of the €350-a-week special Covid-19 welfare payment, which will be in their bank accounts on Wednesday, she said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4238516.1587927223!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"un to decide how to proceed with election for security council seat","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has been vocal on several international issues in recent weeks. Photograph: Salvatore Di NolfiEPAThe United Nations will decide this week how to proceed with a key election for membership of the Security Council, as Ireland competes for a seat on the influential body.The UN vote had been scheduled to take place on June 17th, with Ireland competing with Norway and Canada for two non-permanent seats during the 2021-2022 session. But the coronavirus pandemic has thrown the process into doubt because member states are unable to vote in person at the agency’s headquarters in New York.UN sources said that a decision on how to proceed will be made by the end of this week, though the body may first reach out to its 193 members for opinions.While the UN General Assembly has not been sitting in person since the coronavirus hit, a so-called “silent voting” method has been adopted for resolutions, which gives countries 72 hours to register their objections.Last week the president of the General Assembly wrote to members proposing an e-voting system, but this would apply to votes for resolutions and other matters – not for elections.UN sources said that no decision had been made, and that a postponement was possible.Unlike other votes in the multilateral body, the election of non-permanent Security Council members is by secret ballot.Five seats are up for grabs in June for the 2021-2022 session. While Ireland is competing for one of two seats in the “Western Europe and other states” category, a representative for Africa, the Latin America and Caribbean region, and Asia Pacific will also be chosen.Ireland has held a seat on the Security Council three times in its history. The last occasion was in 2001 in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks.Though the coronavirus pandemic has dominated political life in Ireland and elsewhere for more than a month, Irish officials have been continuing to drive the Government’s foreign-policy agenda in Brussels, Geneva and at the UN in New York.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has also been vocal on several international issues in recent weeks.AnnexationLast week he issued a strongly-worded statement criticising the new Israeli government’s inclusion of a pledge to annex parts of the West Bank in the new coalition agreement. While welcoming the formation of a government in Israel, he said: “Annexation of territory by force is prohibited under international law, including the UN charter, whenever and wherever it occurs, in Europe’s neighbourhood or globally. This is a fundamental principle in the relations of states and the rule of law in the modern world. No one state can set it aside at will.”Ireland’s decision to quadruple funding for the World Health Organisation – a UN agency – is also likely to be welcomed by some members as a sign of Ireland’s commitment to the UN, despite questions over the organisation’s early handling of the pandemic and its relationship with China.The Security Council has yet to take a strong stance on the pandemic sweeping the world, amid tensions between two of its permanent members, China and the US.

Video: The New York Times\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKim Yo-jong, sister of North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un, attends a wreath-laying ceremony at Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum in Hanoi, Vietnam, last year. Photograph:  Jorge SilvaReutersKim Yo-jong has become the focus of global attention after her brother Kim Jong-un failed to appear at a national celebration, sparking speculation about the health of North Korea’s supreme leader.Moon Chung-in, an adviser to the South Korean president, told Fox News on Sunday that he believed Mr Kim was “alive and well”, despite reports suggesting that he was seriously ill. The South Korean presidential office declined to comment on Mr Moon’s remarks.Still, the episode has served as a stark reminder of the risks of a power struggle in the nuclear-armed pariah state.Kim Yo-jong (32) was a favourite of her father, late leader Kim Jong-il, who admired her intelligence. She has been groomed for power since her teens by North Korean propaganda master Kim Ki-nam, according to Michael Madden, a US expert in North Korean leadership.“This is a girl who’s had a masterclass in North Korean politics,” Mr Madden told the Financial Times. Ms Kim, he pointed out, had regularly attended and convened important meetings and had impressed Xi Jinping when she met the Chinese leader. “There’s nobody else that’s going to come in other than her.” Important rolesMs Kim rose to prominence in 2018 when she was dispatched to Seoul to attend the Winter Olympic Games, becoming the first member of the Kim regime to visit South Korea since the Korean war. Behind the scenes she is believed to have increasingly important roles within the ruling party while continuing to support her brother, including in his engagements with US president Donald Trump. The state’s propagandists have also enhanced her legitimacy as part of the direct bloodline from Kim Il Sung, the country’s revolutionary founding leader and a godlike figure, analysts said.When North Korean television last year showed a jowly, red-faced Kim Jong-un atop a white steed on the sacred Mount Paektu, astute North Korean watchers noted the prominence of his sister. She was riding alongside the leader and the leather breast plate, bridle and halter on Ms Kim’s horse were studded with the same shining insignia as her older brother’s mount.“To your average, everyday North Korean, that is a pretty sure sign that she is a special person, that she is part of the Mount Paektu bloodline,” said Rachel Lee, a former North Korea analyst for the US government.Gained authorityBruce Klingner, a former CIA analyst, said that while it had been “widely assumed” that the strict patriarchy of Confucian culture would preclude a woman ruling North Korea, Ms Kim had gained authority in recent years.A person in direct contact with North Korean and Chinese officials – speaking on the condition of anonymity – said it was unlikely that Ms Kim would rule alone and that she would probably be part of a group that would take over in the event of her brother’s death.When Mr Kim took power in 2011, North Korean watchers braced themselves for regime collapse, believing he might lack political authority and dynastic legitimacy after a hurried succession. Similar concerns are being raised about Ms Kim.“She is the only person with a chance of taking the top billing, but that would only be allowed to happen if she gave everyone else some sense of collective leadership,” the person told the Financial Times.They added that Ms Kim could serve as the country’s figurehead but that it was likely to be “the party” that tried to project leadership in a style akin to China before Mr Xi’s dominant rule.Power struggleUnder such circumstances, analysts have suggested that Choe Ryong-hae, a senior political figure and longtime ally of Kim Jong-il who has had recent responsibility for the country’s armed forces, could also assume control as a type of regent.The events have also returned attention to Kim Pyong-il (65), the younger paternal half-brother of Kim Jong-il. After losing a power struggle with the Dear Leader, the only surviving son of Kim Il-sung spent four decades in ambassadorial roles in Europe before returning to Pyongyang last year.Thae Yong Ho, a former senior North Korean diplomat and high-profile defector, suggested that despite Kim Pyong-il’s long absence, he loomed as a challenger, favoured by senior officials.“In their eyes, Yo-jong is just a novice,” Mr Thae said.Still, questions linger over whether a woman, albeit one with royal blood, could wrest control from Pyongyang’s military and political elite.Having dispatched his half-brother Kim Jong-nam, who was assassinated in a Malaysian airport in 2017, as well as his uncle Jang Song-thaek, executed in 2013 among scores of high-level purges, there are few other close family members who stand as alternatives to continue the Kim bloodline.Lacking ambitionKim Jong-chol, the leader’s elder brother, is described as effeminate, lacking ambition and more focused on his love for Eric Clapton and guitars than leadership, according to Washington Post journalist Anna Fifield in her biography of Kim Jong-un. While Mr Klingner said North Korea would take steps to avoid a tumultuous handover, he cautioned that “even an initially successful succession could deteriorate into a power struggle, with fissures among the senior leadership arising over time”.Duyeon Kim, a Seoul-based expert with the International Crisis Group, a think-tank, did not rule out the potential for a challenge to Kim Yo-jong.Historic meeting between US president Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-unStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4239222.1588009981!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gove rejects eu request for mini embassy in belfast after brexit","story":"The British minister leading negotiations on the post-Brexit Northern Ireland protocol has rejected a European Union request for what he described as “a mini-embassy” in Belfast.

Photograph: House of CommonsPA WireThe British minister leading negotiations on the post-Brexit Northern Ireland protocol has rejected a European Union request for what he described as “a mini-embassy” in Belfast.The EU wants to open an office in Northern Ireland to monitor checks and controls on goods crossing the Irish Sea after the end of the current transition period.But Michael Gove told a committee of MPs that Britain saw no reason for any permanent presence for the EU apart from its delegation’s headquarters in London.“Of course it is the case that the EU has the right to monitor the operation of what UK officials are doing but there’s no need for there to be a mini-embassy in Belfast in order for that to happen,” he told the House of Commons committee on the future relationship with the EU.In a letter to the European Commission, paymaster general Penny Mordaunt said any necessary monitoring could be carried out by means of ad hoc visits by EU officials to the North.Under the protocol, goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to EU customs controls unless they are explicitly exempt.Delicate balanceThe two sides agreed that checks should be carried out by the British authorities but that EU officials could monitor how they are implemented.“The proposition of a permanent EU office, with permanent staff whose primary purpose (as you acknowledge) would be to engage in a form of supervision of UK implementation of the protocol, is not consistent with the delicate balance of rights and responsibilities, on both parties, set out in the protocol,” Ms Mordaunt said.“Second, one of the primary purposes of the protocol is the protection of the BelfastGood Friday Agreement in all its dimensions. We must therefore aim to implement it in a way that is acceptable to both communities in Northern Ireland and mitigates its effects on them. Both the EU and the UK face obligations in this regard and both sides must make special efforts to develop reasonable proposals in implementing the protocol. A special EU office, uniquely in the regions and nations of the UK, in order to implement a protocol that has attracted controversy, would in our view be isive in political and community terms.”Mr Gove was pressed on what steps his government was taking to prepare ports on either side of the Irish Sea for the customs checks that will be required under the protocol. But he insisted that “the\u0026nbspprecise nature of how the protocol will be implemented” will be determined in a specialised British-EU committee which holds its next meeting on Thursday.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

In particular, it showed a strong genetic link to delirium, fever, fatigue, shortness of breath, diarrhoea and the loss of taste and smell.NHS England figures released last week confirmed that black, Asian and minority ethnic patients face a disproportionately high risk of death from Covid-19.Of the patients in hospital who tested positive for coronavirus up to April 17, 16.2 per cent were of BAME background despite these communities making up only around 13 per cent of the total population.Those who identified as being of Indian heritage made up the single worst affected group, accounting for three per cent of Covid-19 hospital deaths, with those from the Caribbean the next largest group, at 2.9 per cent.Professor Tim Spector, who led the King\u0027s College London research, said this could be either because some of these groups are more likely to suffer underlying health conditions such as diabetes, which increases the risk from the virus, or down to a more direct genetic predisposition.We\u0027ve only started asking about race in the last few days, he said. It\u0027s quite possible that genetic variants in, for example, Asian people could play a role in both the susceptibility to and severity of the disease. However, that won\u0027t be the whole answer.It is hoped the findings could provide scientists with an indication on how to go about developing treatments, as well as helping to identify high-risk groups.Prof Spector suggested that people\u0027s diet, and in turn the health of their microbiome, linked to the immune system, could be influencing how susceptible they are to Covid-19. He said this could explain why poorer areas appeared to be more badly hit.The Covid-19 Symptom Tracker app is helping inform scientists about the progression of the virus, although the number actually using it fell by almost 75 per cent earlier this month.However, an analysis of the data published on April 8 suggests that the coronavirus lockdown is working, with the number of people aged 20-69 reporting symptoms falling from 1.9 million then to 1.4 million across the UK.The peak in terms of symptoms was April 1, since then falling steadily at about seven per cent a day,” said Prof Spector. It isn\u0027t just about the classic symptoms, fever and cough, which were the criteria for formal testing – it’s actually much wider.It\u0027s using all the data to give us a really good picture of what\u0027s going on around the country.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"kim yo jong north korean leader kim jong uns younger sister","story":"Respectful and waif-like, Kim Yo-jong has often melted into the background during her authoritarian brother Kim Jong-un’s public appearances - at times emerging from the shadows to hold his ashtray or assiduously take notes as he discusses matters of state with world leaders.But behind her deferential demeanour, analysts say the youngest child of the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il is bright, calculating and a highly influential figure in country’s cutthroat corridors of power.Amid shifting rumours about Kim Jong-un’s health, the spotlight has switched to Kim Yo-jong, believed to be 31, and her future role in the world’s most reclusive nation.With his own children still in their infancy, if Kim ever were to disappear, his younger sister, already his de facto chief of staff, is emerging as a chief contender to succeed him.  The question of succession is “basically unknowable,” said Andray Abrahamian, a visiting scholar at George Mason University Korea.  “It’s extremely hard to imagine anyone else in the Kim family stepping in to do what Kim Jong-un does right now.”But he added: “Kim Yo-jong could be both a symbolic link to the Kim family but it’s also clear that she is a politician and she seems to like the game.”The younger Kim was first spotted in public at her father’s funeral in 2011, and for years analysts struggled to identify of the young woman who seemed to move around freely in Kim Jong-un’s presence, initially surmising that she could be his wife.It later emerged that they were siblings who shared the same Japanese-born mother, Ko Yong-hui, and who had forged a tight bond of trust while studying together at the same private school in Switzerland.The brother and sister were also closer in age to each other than to their older brother Kim Jong-chul, reported to be a music-loving Eric Clapton superfan, and half-brother Kim Jong-nam, who was allegedly assassinated by the regime in Kuala Lumpur’s main airport in 2017.Despite North Korea’s deeply engrained patriarchal values, Kim Jong-il is said to have doted on “Princess Yo-jong,” who was a favourite child.In an article in the New Yorker, Barbara Demick, a North Korea expert, writes that former Russian official, Konstantin Pulikovsky, who travelled with Kim Jong-il on his train, wrote in a memoir that the leader praised the intelligence of his daughter, while deriding his sons as “idle blockheads.”Before sealing her influential position at the heart of North Korea’s elite, Kim is said to have been well-travelled and may have studied in Paris.She appeared to move closer to the reclusive regime’s centre of power after her uncle, Jang Song-thaek, was executed and her once powerful aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, disappeared from public view in 2013.As she gathered official titles, it was clear that her star was rising. In 2014, she was identified as the deputy director of the ruling Workers Party’s department of propaganda and agitation, where she has been credited with carefully crafting her brother’s public image at home and abroad.In 2017, she was made an alternate member of the ruling politburo, the country’s top decision-making body – believed to be only the second woman ever to hold that position.But it wasn’t until 2018 when she made her international debut attending the February Winter Olympics in South Korea as a special envoy ahead of historic peace talks between Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president, in April of the same year.Kim charmed the local media who pored over every detail of her “humble” style in both dress and manners and dubbed her North Korea’s “Ivanka Trump.” At the Olympic opening ceremony, a brief glance towards Mike Pence, the US vice-president, went viral after it was perceived as a “deadly side eye.”Known for her simple, business-like style, Kim’s growing status has been emphasised this year by the first ever public statements issued in her own name.Last month, she condemned South Korea as a “frightened dog barking” after it protested Pyongyang’s live-fire military exercises, and in March she said her brother had “special and firm personal relations,” with Donald Trump, the US president, despite ongoing tension over the North’s nuclear weapons.Kim is believed to be married to a close relative of Choe Ryong Hae, the ceremonial head of state and the country’s second most powerful man, who has also been touted as a possible successor to Kim Jong-un.Her close connections to the country’s powerful elders could stand Kim in good stead in a future power struggle.Despite her claim to the Kim dynasty’s sacred “Mount Paektu” bloodline, as a woman Kim would have to overcome sexist hurdles to take the top job. But even in the face of extreme patriarchy, her ascendancy cannot be ruled out.  “It’s a country, system and culture that defies predictions and creates outcomes that you wouldn’t think possible,” said Mr Abrahamian.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/26/TELEMMGLPICT000230210858_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqvxY1SBh3Zy94n8Z2-u3DXpo3vSb9RvelYMC6seL5330.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"want free responsibility behave differently","story":"Not only are exercise and sociability major parts of the quality of our lives, but important factors in longevityGovernments should be aiming to maximise freedom, but with the corresponding duties understoodLike many families in the current lockdown, my three sisters and I catch up each weekend on Zoom and share our news. A little over a year ago, we lost our father, Nigel, at the age of 90, and we often contemplate what he would have made of this situation.Our Dad was incorrigibly active and sociable into his late old age, walking many miles each day and raising large sums for charity through skying and mountain climbing in his eighties. He went to local pubs every night without fail, a tradition he maintained to within a few days of his death. Each day he enjoyed meeting new people. He was not a man you could confine, or ever lecture on how to live, and he would recall that he had been to the funerals of most people who had told him what was good for him.Like most of us in Britain, he would have found lockdown frustrating but necessary. However, what he could never have accepted is the idea that after a certain time, most of the country would be released from restrictions while those above a certain age would have to remain isolated for their own safety. At that point he would almost certainly have said he would be the judge of that himself and resumed his enjoyment of fresh air and some community life. He would have pointed out that he was fitter and more active than some people half his age. Any official telling him he was vulnerable would have received a memorable lesson in how someone who had lived through the war, served in the Army and survived for nearly a century could decide when to do things at their own risk.As ministers ponder how to relax the lockdown in the coming weeks, they would do well to avoid telling the over-70s to stay in their homes for the rest of the year, or they will find there are more Nigel Hagues out there than they might have bargained for. Furthermore, people like him will have a serious point – not only are exercise and sociability major parts of the quality of their lives, but also important factors in their longevity. They will additionally have an important moral argument on their side: as long as we are engaged in a collective and common action to combat the virus we are all obliged to act together, but once it is a matter of inidual preservation then at least part of the judgement involved should rest with each person.I do not envy my former colleagues as they try to pick their way through these and other dilemmas, but I would urge them to shy away from solutions based on blanket, one-size-fits-all policies dictating the hourly habits of millions of people. Far better to stress that our rights as citizens, as they are slowly re-established, are firmly attached to vital responsibilities, for young and old, rich and poor.Of course, we are now used to the idea that our right to go to the supermarket is coupled with a responsibility to stand apart from others. But the right to return to more of normal life must involve a vast extension of such responsibilities. The long-awaited app, which tells us when we have been near someone who develops Covid-19, is being prepared, ready to install on our phones. Once it is ready, the freedom to resume moving around must go along with the responsibility to download it and use it. We will have to accept very different responsibilities determining how we greet, work and move around other people. A young person who disregards that should not be in their workplace, pub or gym, while an older one who is very conscious of this ought to be there if they wish.The notion that rights and responsibilities are intimately attached to each other has become weakened in modern society. Good schools do teach the connection, and millions of people instinctively live up to their responsibilities to others – witness the vast numbers who have volunteered to help in this crisis. Yet in many ways our concepts of rights have become absolute and inalienable regardless of our behaviour.We are rightly proud of our freedom of speech in democracies, but in the digital age many people abuse that freedom with bullying and intemperate behaviour online. We believe in freedom of religion, but that too is abused by those who brainwash vulnerable iniduals into a twisted and hateful brand of their own beliefs. Our right to eat what we like is not associated, for many people, with a responsibility to bear in mind how it is produced. And our right to burn fossil fuels is certainly not combined with a responsibility to preserve life for future generations.Does everyone associate their much-valued right to vote with the responsibility to keep well informed about events? Or the right to healthcare with the responsibility to moderate our indulgence and lead an active life so that such care is focused on those who need it most? There was never a golden age when such thoughts were universally combined, but much political ideology in recent decades has lost sight of the connection between freedom and obligation. Businesses that fail to invest in their employees, or those people who amass wealth without trying to use it for wider benefit have taken advantage of an ultra-libertarianism that relies solely on markets. Just as bad, socialists respond by trying to sweep away both rights and responsibilities and rely excessively on state direction.Governments should be aiming for a future in which we exercise great freedom, but with the corresponding duties understood. The coming weeks and months will be a period in history in which the connection between the two is exceptionally clear. The fragility of freedom has now been brutally revealed. The need to live responsibly is suddenly ripe for emphasis. In this country, people of all ages will be ready for that.Asking them to respond in the right way will require openness and transparency from ministers about the options and their plans. The public are entirely capable of understanding that they must maintain the current effort while a vigorous discussion over what happens next takes place. They will react most positively, not to any one group being told they are losing their liberty indefinitely, but to all of us being told that liberty and responsibility go together – irrespective of how young or old we happen to be.     The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

more than a mile wide – and will come closer at the end of the century.The object known as\u0026nbsp(52768) 1998\u0026nbspOR2\u0026nbspwill still be relatively distant from Earth when it comes past: at 3.9 million miles away, it will be around 16 times the distance from the Earth to the Moon.But it is relatively close for such a large object, allowing researchers to observe the object to understand more about its orbit and asteroids more generally.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThat could help us understand the asteroid better ahead of a closer flyby in around 60 years.The Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico has been tracking the 1.2 mile-wide space rock as it edges nearer, after Nasa first spotted it in 1998.Asteroids from another solar system found \u0027hiding in plain sight\u0027Scientists have joked that the latest image of the asteroid look like it is wearing a mask due to dust and debris passing around it.The small-scale topographic features such as hills and ridges on one end of asteroid 1998 OR2 are fascinating scientifically, said Dr Anne Virkki, head of Planetary Radar at the observatory.But since we are all thinking about Covid-19 these features make it look like 1998 OR2 remembered to wear a mask.The asteroid is classed as a PHO (potentially hazardous object) because it is bigger than 140 metres and will come within five million miles of Earth\u0027s orbit, but no known PHO poses an immediate danger to the planet.Nevertheless, scientists continue to keep an eye on the asteroid to see how it will move beyond 2020.The radar measurements allow us to know more precisely where the asteroid will be in the future, including its future close approaches to Earth, explained Flaviane Venditti, a research scientist at the observatory.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a

The loans will be 100 per cent back by the government, unlike under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) which is 80 per cent state backed.This means that the process for applying will be significantly quicker and less bureaucratic than CBILS which has been heavily criticised for not getting money to businesses quickly enough.The scheme is aimed at small businesses but the Treasury has not set a size limit on companies that can apply. Therefore, companies that want a small loan quickly may choose to apply for a bounceback loan rather than a CBILS.Applications are around two-pages long and are submitted through an online form from Monday. Only basic details are required to verify the company exists and is eligible. Company directors self-certify that the information they provide is true and their lender then decides whether or not to approve the loan. A tax return may be required in a small number of cases.Only businesses that existed on 1 March 2020 can apply. Money should be in a business’ account around 24 hours after an application has been approved.Because banks are not on the hook for any losses under the scheme, they will not have to carry out their normal full credit checks and procedures which can time consuming. Some firms had complained of being rejected arbitrarily for a CBILS loan. The new scheme should avoid that outcome.How small businesses can apply to the government\u0027s bounceback £50,000 loan schemeNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBanks will not have to absorb losses on loans taken out by companies that later cannot repay all of the debt. If a business cannot repay, and the funds cannot be recouped through normal means, the state will take a loss.The Treasury says it is taking action to ensure that the primary homes and vehicles of sole traders (who, unlike companies, are not legally incorporated entities) are protected from any debt collection proceedings.The government will cover interest and fees for the first twelve months, and businesses will not be required to repay any of the loan balance during that time. After that, interest rates will be “very low”, according to the Treasury, with a loan typically paid back over five years.No, each firm can only take out one or other form of loan. The CBILS scheme allows for larger sums to be borrowed – up to £5m per business – but requires a lengthier application process with more stringent checks.However, companies that have already obtained a CBILS loan for £50,000 or less may be able to switch it over to a bounceback loan which will be 100 per cent government-guaranteed, rather than 80 per cent.The Independent understands that a company which obtains a bounceback loan will later be able to convert it to a CBILS loan (and therefore take out a larger amount) if the application to do so is approved by their lender.Businesses who take out a bounceback loan will still be eligible for other direct government support including grants of £10,000 for small businesses and £25,000 for hospitality businesses, as well as the furlough scheme.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastThe primary existing loan scheme, CBILS, has been criticised because many of the companies most in need of funds were being rejected or simply told not to apply as they were not eligible. One of the key issues is that a business must be deemed “viable” by a bank. Given the extraordinary economic circumstances caused by the virus and lockdown measures in place to halt its spread, a large number fo businesses were simply unable to demonstrate viability.For example, how could a catering company, reliant largely on summer events which have now been cancelled, demonstrate that it was “viable” going forward?Mr Sunak reiterated on Monday that he wanted to preserve the productive capacity of the economy after the virus is contained. That means delivering emergency funding to hundreds of thousands of businesses so that they are in a position to start back up again as soon as possible. It is hoped that the new loan scheme will do that.The government has adapted its approach on an almost daily basis since the crisis began but it has been accused of being slow to realise the needs of small firms.It had used the banks as the “delivery mechanism” for CBILS because they already have the infrastructure to deal with processing applications for loans. This was meant to get the money out as quickly as possible but banks have approved less than £4bn of loans so far with the need for funding thought to be many multiples of that. Some other countries have been able to get cash to firms more quickly.under current plans, the existing scheme will not be changed.Part of the problem is that UK lenders must cover 20 per cent of losses – and sometimes more - for funding. That finance is needed primarily because of a government-mandated shutdown of the economy so the argument is that the government should cover potential losses. Applying their normal lending criteria, banks are nervous that they will lend out billions, much of which they will never see again. Of course, these are not normal times so businesses argue more flexible criteria should be applied.Another big problem has been reams of paperwork, with lenders asking for, among other things, forward financial projections. Firms say they have no way of being able to provide these given the uncertainty of the situation.With increasingly dire warnings about the impact on small businesses the government has been pressured to take further action. It may well have to add to these measures in due course.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The approach opened a rift with European governments planning systems that would store data on centralized servers.Health and privacy researchers also cited privacy concerns that the companies addressed on Friday by making it harder to use system-generated data to track people.How technology and apps could allow the UK to leave lockdownThe numbers that identify users will be randomly generated, and so-called metadata such as Bluetooth signal strength and users\u0027 phone models will now be encrypted along with primary data about who they have been near.Exposure time, or how long two phones have been near each other, will be rounded to 5-minute intervals, to prevent using detailed time data to match up phones to people.The companies also sought to address health researchers\u0027 concerns that the system would be ineffective. Since Bluetooth signals can penetrate some walls and can be detected even when brief and faint, researchers worried about false alerts from neighbours in apartment buildings or passers-by in public spaces.Apple and Google will now provide data about Bluetooth power levels to better estimate how close two phones came to each other and for how long, letting authorities set their own thresholds for when to alert people.The companies also said they would provide data on how many days had passed since the last contact with an infected person, to help authorities notify users about what steps to take.Additional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That is far brighter than any previous example, as well as producing more of a steady glow.The researchers managed to create the plants after realising that the bioluminescence of some mushrooms is metabolically similar to the natural processes found in plants. That allowed researchers to take that DNA from the mushroom and move it into the plants, allowing them to glow with a light borrowed from the mushroom.How to bring nature into your home with house plants during lockdownPrevious attempts to do the same have run into problems because it was difficult to use the glow from bacteria. Usually, the bacterial parts taken from more simple organisms do not work when transferred into more complex ones.The breakthrough came when researchers found the parts of a mushroom that allow for biolumiscence. That meant that they were able to define the mechanism inside of\u0026nbspan advanced multicellular organism for the first time, and discovered that it would work particularly well in plants.Mushrooms are not closely related to plants, and so the difficult could have come about once again. But researchers discovered that the organic molecule at the centre of the light emission from such mushrooms is also required when plants make cells walls, giving the scientists their opening to get it in.By dropping the DNA from the mushroom into the plants, they were able to create examples that glowed ten times as bright, the researchers claim. They are so bright that light could be seen coming from\u0026nbspleaves, stems, roots, and flowers and captured using a normal smartphone camera, they claim.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After the government was heavily criticised for its failure to provide equipment to medical staff, Sarah says she\u0027s never had to enter a Covid-19 ward without PPE, but has “probably worn about five to six different types of gowns and visors and masks, depending on the stock and the flow and the amount of different stuff available at different sites.”You can read about the interview here.You can subscribe to the series on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Acast or wherever you listen.

The caller’s video was disabled, but journalists saw his name flash briefly on screen before he left the meeting.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFive minutes later, a separate account joined the call, this time unnamed. Again, video was switched off so that only a black square was displayed among the screens showing up to 100 people who had been invited to attend. The anonymous user account, which remained in the meeting until the end, was later shown to be linked to the mobile phone used by the same Financial Times reporter.‘Digital parliament’ details unveiled: MPs to ask questions by ZoomDi Stefano posted the news on Twitter while The Independent’s staff were still being told details of, and reasons behind, salary cuts and furloughs, and before the editor, Christian Broughton, and senior management at the title had contacted other journalists who could not join the video call, including those based in the US.Shortly afterwards, the Financial Times published a report by Di Stefano, including confidential details about the company’s advertising downturn and quoting chief executive Zach Leonard. The article stated that “people on the call” were the source of the story.The investigation by The Independent also shows that the account linked to Di Stefano’s mobile phone gained access to an Evening Standard video call made by editor George Osborne, announcing large-scale furloughs and salary cuts to staff on 1 April.Again, the details appeared on Di Stefano’s Twitter account, describing the “internal Zoom call” before it had ended, and a report quoting Osborne in the private meeting appeared on the Financial Times website.Use of the video call app Zoom has soared as millions around the world have abandoned offices to work from home, and it is the same software used by the Cabinet during the pandemic.Di Stefano joined the FT\u0026nbspas a media and technology reporter in January from Buzzfeed, where he gained a reputation as a quick source of media news and gossip, breaking stories to his 100,000 followers on Twitter.The FT’s code of conduct specifies: “The press must not seek to obtain or publish material acquired by … intercepting private or mobile telephone calls, messages or emails. Engaging in misrepresentation or subterfuge … can generally be justified only in the public interest and then only when the material cannot be obtained by other means.”The editor of The Independent Christian Broughton said: “We respect freedom of speech and understand the challenges of newsgathering, but The Independent considers the presence of a third-party journalist in a staff briefing to be entirely inappropriate and an unwarranted intrusion into our employees’ privacy. Our spokesperson had a full statement prepared for the press – any interested reporters only needed to call and ask.”A spokesperson for the Evening Standard said: “For a journalist from the FT to have illegitimately accessed a private Zoom call is unacceptable. We are sure the FT will want to offer an immediate explanation and an apology.”The Independent separately contacted the Financial Times for comment for this article but they declined. Mark Di Stefano also declined to comment.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But since the coronavirus pandemic hit, the page has carried an indication that the company\u0027s customer service agents are having to work harder than usual and that they may be slower than normal to respond.As with most companies, Netflix has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, with filming almost entirely brought to a close and technical staff working from home. The company said last week that it would look to cut back experimental new features to ensure that it would be providing meaningful value to users.At the same time, it announced a huge surge in the number of subscribers on its service – though cautioned that growth could stop as lockdowns were lifted.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Indeed, they have become four times as frequent\u0026nbspin the past half-century.Since the 1970s, it is\u0026nbspestimated at least three dozen infectious diseases have emerged from human interference with animals, including Sars, Mers, Ebola, bird flu, swine flu and the Zika virus. As far back as 2007 the World Health Organisation warned that infectious diseases were emerging at a rate that had not been seen before.The spread of the viruses is put down to a deadly combination of wildlife trafficking and consumption, increasing human encroachment into wildlife habitats as more people live in densely populated areas – and air travel, which enables pathogens to take hold globally.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThree years ago, an article\u0026nbsppublished by the US National Centre for Biotechnology Information stated, presciently: “The Aids and influenza pandemics have claimed and will continue to claim millions of lives. The recent Sars and Ebola epidemics have threatened populations across borders. The emergence of Mers may well be warning signals of a nascent pandemic threat.”Zoonotic diseases are complex, and it’s sometimes impossible to say a virus has disappeared, because it might have many different strains, and might mutate and lie dormant. This is a timeline of the main zoonotic diseases to have hit us since the start of the 20th century:Wildlife trade continues in Asia amid calls for restrictions China tries to shut down wildlife trade but markets remain openBlack-market trade ‘may undermine Vietnam ban on disease-rife markets’Stray dogs eating bat meat ‘could have sparked coronavirus pandemic’The 1918 flu pandemic: This was the most severe pandemic in modern times, killing at least 50 million people in two years. It is widely believed that the virus originated in birds because it shared genetic mutations with the bird flu virus later found in Asia, and could have transferred to horses in the trenches of the first world war before spreading to humans. This is disputed, with one study suggesting it came from mammals.Asian flu, 1957:\u0026nbspIn February 1957, a new influenza virus, known as H2N2 emerged in east Asia, which spread into a pandemic. It originated from an avian influenza virus, causing an estimated 1.1 million deaths worldwide.HIV: First identified in 1981, the disease is thought to have been acquired by people in central Africa hunting chimpanzees and coming into contact with their infected blood. However, studies show that HIV may have jumped from apes to humans as far back as the late 1800s, and it has existed in the West since at least the mid to late 1970s. HIV has killed about 35 million people to date, according to the World Health Organisation.Sars:\u0026nbspSevere acute respiratory syndrome is another type of coronavirus, which killed at least 770 people globally in an epidemic in 2002-3. Most victims were in southern China, Vietnam and Singapore. Scientists are not certain of its origins but like Covid-19 it’s thought it could have come from bats and spread to other animals such as civet cats, which are commonly sold in squalid conditions in street markets. The epidemic resulted in more than 8,000 cases, in 26 countries. Of those, 774 died.Swine flu: In 2009-2010 a new strain of flu emerged in pigs in Mexico. The H1N1 virus killed nearly tens of thousands of people in a global pandemic that spread to 214 countries in less than a year. However, overall the outbreak was not as serious as originally predicted, largely because many older people were already immune to it. And the NHS says it now circulates each year and is considered a normal seasonal flu strain, which is covered by the annual seasonal flu vaccine. A study in 2013 suggested between 123,000 and 200,000 people globally may have died as a result of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.Mers:\u0026nbspFirst identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome is also a coronavirus whose symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. With an estimated death rate of 35 per cent, the disease has killed 858 people, according to the WHO. Again, scientists think it spread to humans from bats, this time via camels.Ebola: A 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976, killing 11,300 people. Scientists say it began with a child in Guinea who came into contact with infected bats, but it has since been widely linked to the killing and butchering of bush meat, including monkeys, chimps, antelopes, fruit bats, porcupines and rats.Zika: First identified in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys, the mosquito-borne virus caused alarm in 2015, when it was thought to be the cause of thousands of cases of microcephaly – a shorter-than-normal head – in babies in Brazil. Outbreaks soon appeared throughout the Americas, Africa and other regions. It was thought to have killed 29 babies.Bird flu: Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, has many different strains but one of those, H7N9, has caused 1,568 cases in humans and 616 deaths worldwide since 2013, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.Another strain of the virus, H5N1, first identified in 1997, spread across east and southeast Asia, killing six people in Hong Kong and leading to vast swathes of chickens and turkeys – from Hong Kong to Britain – having to be culled early after contracting the disease.

It is a charity that has adapted with incredible speed to the crisis to help the most vulnerable in our community. In just five weeks, they have responded to the increased demand for food by quadrupling their output. We hope that our donation, coupled with the campaigning power of The Independent, will help the project grow and reach as many as possible of the one in five Londoners at risk of food poverty.”Another substantial contribution came in yesterday from the Julia and Hans Rausing Trust, which has assigned £16.5m\u0026nbspto charities at the forefront of the coronavirus pandemic and has donated £50,000 to our appeal.How to support our campaignJulia and Hans Rausing,\u0026nbspheirs of food packing giant Tetra Pak, said: “We have been impressed not only by the speed of The Felix Project’s response to the crisis, but the way in which they have managed to get a number of organisations working together to help people across the capital. Efforts like this support communities across London at this time of need, and we are glad to support their inspiring work.”We launched our appeal, in association with the Evening Standard, on Friday 27 March\u0026nbspand have reached £3m\u0026nbspthanks to the generous backing of dozens of London foundations, philanthropists and corporations, including Garfield Weston Foundation, Lansdowne Partners, the Westminster Foundation, Sir Peter Blake, Burberry, Eranda Rothschild Foundation, Citibank and investment holding company Temasek.More than 1,170 members of the public have contributed, donating £103,837 on our Virgin Money Giving page.But there is a sense that we are still in the foothills of the economic crisis, with experts warning the government that food poverty is about to get far worse. The Food Foundation has reported that eight million people in Britain face food insecurity and that three million have been missing meals since lockdown. The Institute for Social and Economic Research at University of Essex estimates that 6.5 million jobs could be lost in the coming months, causing a huge rise in demand for free food.As the biggest supplier of free food in London, The Felix Project has been operating 12 hours a day, six days a week, distributing surplus food to giant community hubs, including Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in Haringey, as well as to 80 charities and schools across the capital.The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

But as the country fights its greatest health crisis in a century, it also has an estimated three million people going hungry during the lockdown. The coronavirus pandemic has shown why the National Health Service is of such immense importance. What if there could be a National Food Service too?There is in fact a project bearing that very name. The National Food Service is a network of initiatives committed to tackling food insecurity, social isolation and food waste. It is currently made up of 13 branches stretching from Glasgow to Falmouth and over the last few weeks it has begun to forge new links all over the country. It will not stop there. “We think there should be a National Food Service in every city of the country. That’s the aim,” says Selina Treuherz, one of the activists behind the service.That may sound incredibly ambitious but Treuherz argues that the foundations of what the NFS is attempting to create already exist. Thousands of local groups have led the fight against hunger in their communities for the best part of a decade or more. “What we’re saying is we don’t need the state to come in and build a National Food Service,” she explains. “It’s just about working together to make it stronger and to strengthen the communities in the areas that need it most.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn practice, that means social eating spaces where those in need can come and enjoy a meal with others. “I feel like we are proving it can be done now,” Treuherz adds. “Our founding branch, Food Hall in Sheffield\u0026nbspwhere I volunteer, has been running for five years. We’ve been serving the community on a contribute-what-you-can basis. It might seem like a radical idea but it’s not at all. It’s just people helping each other with the means that they can.”A fully realised NFS would not be government-run like its health equivalent. Each existing branch in the network is autonomous. They share values, resources and the same overarching goal – to ensure that nobody goes hungry – but they operate independently and in different ways to each other. This means there is “not a single point of weakness”, Treuherz says, such as an over-reliance on central funding. The NFS is only beholden to the people it helps feed. “We’re built by each community for the community.”But the pandemic presents new challenges. An organisation designed to bring people together through food is now having to focus on merely feeding them and support is needed. NFS branches are still operating, making around 3,000 meals since the lockdown began and delivering food parcels to communities in need, but they have found that they are often required to step in where the response from local government is falling short.“If I’m honest, I’ve been on the helpline quite a lot and the government response is pretty shocking,” says Treuherz. “We’re getting a lot of people ringing up saying they’ve had one parcel and been told that’s their lot, and they’re on their own in the house.” The parcels supplied by councils have often been low on food. Even when the boxes are full, they can be of little nutritional value.Food waste has also increased following the wave of stockpiling at the beginning of the crisis. The branch at which Treuherz volunteers in Sheffield used surplus stock from supermarkets to help feed those in need but they are currently struggling to meet demand.\u0026nbsp“We actually can’t get enough food to feed enough people,” she says. “It’s really sad. You run out of food at the end of the day and you just can’t help everyone.”Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastTo help voluntary groups provide emergency food for those in need during the crisis, the NFS has petitioned the government with three demands: to offer more support for organisations tackling food insecurity to reduce barriers to immediate food access to protect community spaces and increase access to kitchen facilities. “It’s given about £3.25m to food waste groups which just is not nearly enough for a national effort,” explains Treuherz.But even in a pandemic, there are positives to be found. “Community groups are coming together, there’s this whole idea of mutual aid and food is playing an essential role in that,” she adds. “It’s really important that we build on this for the future and this doesn’t end at the end of Covid-19 because this is such an opportunity for change both within our food system and the rest of society,” she adds.Britain will look radically different after this crisis has passed.

Helping our initiative, the farmer had an excess of cauliflowers and brassicas that he offered for free if the charity was able to come and pick them.The recent warm weather had sped up their growth cycle, meaning the farm would have been unable to harvest and sell them before they flowered and spoiled.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn addition, the farm was able to donate potatoes that were deemed too big or too small for the commercial market. Katie Brookes, from\u0026nbspEdenbridge, was one of the harvesters who responded to the request for help sent out by the Felix Project on social media. She spent a day last week cutting cauliflowers.How to support our campaignShe admitted it had been hard work as each volunteer was given a knife to cut the vegetables before placing them in string sacks. Social distancing meant they were each given their own row to harvest. But the 53-year-old said the hard work was worth it. “Everyone wanted to get out and do something. It was a great opportunity to help out and do something worthwhile.”Hackney-based NGO Feedback Global, which is working to secure more sustainable food systems, worked with The Felix Project to secure the produce by alerting the charity to the opportunity.Created with Sketch.

And the £50,000 balances the risk to the taxpayer with the need to support our smallest businesses.”Labour’s shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said Mr Sunak’s announcement would be a “relief” for businesses, but said the UK had “an enormous mountain to climb” to match other countries’ support for smaller firms.“It’s a relief to hear from the chancellor that he’s listened to calls from this side of the House, business, and others that we need a full guarantee for at least some loans – he stated\u0026nbsp those of up to £50,000,” said Ms Dodds.“But we need to be clear the UK has an enormous mountain to climb in this area. Switzerland has a population of under 9 million, yet it approved four times as many loans within its first week than the UK has done in a month.“We’re running out of time, so can I ask the chancellor how he will ensure that banks back loans and get them\u0026nbspto those businesses that need it. How will they get out of the door and what plans does he have to ensure the capacity will be there in banks to provide those loans?”CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn said the bounce\u0026nbspback loan scheme was\u0026nbsp”transformational”.“Sole traders, micro-firms and entrepreneurs will now have a simple route to fast finance to stay afloat, without red tape or time-consuming checks,” said Dame Carolyn. “Thousands of businesses could be saved by this lifeline. Banks now need to continue their work in overdrive to get the loans flowing faster.”British Chambers of Commerce director general Adam Marshall said: “The chancellor has demonstrated he is listening to the concerns of our business communities and taking steps to get cash to the front line where it is needed. This new route for our smallest companies to apply quickly and get a fast decision will be crucial to those who have struggled to get a CBILS loan.”Banking industry body UK Finance said there was a “shared responsibility to take all measures possible to get relief to businesses”.“Following the changes to the scheme announced today lenders will only ask businesses for information and data they might reasonably be able to provide at speed and we will not require the provision of forward-looking financial information or business plans from businesses applying for CBILS-backed lending, relying instead on our own information to assess credit and business viability,” said UK Finance.“Frontline staff have been working tirelessly to get money to those viable businesses that need help and we stand ready to support many more customers in the weeks ahead.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It has already sent a version to EU negotiators, but has not made it public. The EU has made its proposed text public.Asked why the UK didn’t publish its text at the same time as the EU, Mr Gove said the bloc’s version would have been leaked anyway because of its contact with diplomats and that the commission was simply making “a virtue out of a necessity”.UK ‘failing to engage’ in Brexit talks, says EU chief Michel Barnier“We wanted to make sure that the commission had time and space to look at our proposals,” he said of the UK’s own reticence to publish.Addressing his claims that the EU had bent its principles for Covid-19, Mr Gove said: “One of the reasons why we want to be outside the legal architecture of the European Union at the end of the transition period is so we can have the maximum flexibility when it comes to state aid, government procurement, and to other steps that we may need to strengthen our economy.“We’ve seen the way that during the Covid-19 crisis some of the principles of the European Union have been set aside very prudently by the EU to enable member states to take the appropriate steps required, and we have seen both on restrictions of border movements and also on economic interventions actions by inidual member states, national governments, which in ordinary time the EU would have found difficult to countenance.”In fact, the EU’s Schengen treaty that abolishes border controls already contains provisions for temporary border controls in the name of public health or national security. They were previously used on a widespread basis as recently as the refugee crisis.Created with Sketch.High noon in a coronavirus-stricken world Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, part of The Grand Palace)An empty street leading to the historic Old Town SquareLawn stretching towards the Capitol, home of CongressA watch showing the time in front of Damascus GateThe Houses of Parliament seen from Westminster BridgeEmpty lanes in the city that saw the first outbreak of diseaseThe Malecon road and esplanade winds along the city\u0027s seafrontA little busier than elsewhere: midday traffic in Tahrir SquareThe Brandenburg Gate, the only surviving city gate in the capitalBolivar Avenue, opened in 1949 and the site of many demonstrations and ralliesSpasskaya Tower (left) on the eastern wall of the Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s CathedralThe harbourside Eminonu district is usually buzzing with activityRajpath, a ceremonial boulevard that runs through the capitalThe Roman amphitheatre that dates back to the 2nd century ADThe main concourse of Grand Central station in ManhattanMaidan Nezalezhnosti, the site of many political protests since the end of the Soviet eraThe odd walker out in the midday sun on Ring Road CentralA man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, part of The Grand Palace)An empty street leading to the historic Old Town SquareLawn stretching towards the Capitol, home of CongressA watch showing the time in front of Damascus GateThe Houses of Parliament seen from Westminster BridgeEmpty lanes in the city that saw the first outbreak of diseaseThe Malecon road and esplanade winds along the city\u0027s seafrontA little busier than elsewhere: midday traffic in Tahrir SquareThe Brandenburg Gate, the only surviving city gate in the capitalBolivar Avenue, opened in 1949 and the site of many demonstrations and ralliesSpasskaya Tower (left) on the eastern wall of the Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s CathedralThe harbourside Eminonu district is usually buzzing with activityRajpath, a ceremonial boulevard that runs through the capitalThe Roman amphitheatre that dates back to the 2nd century ADThe main concourse of Grand Central station in ManhattanMaidan Nezalezhnosti, the site of many political protests since the end of the Soviet eraThe odd walker out in the midday sun on Ring Road CentralThe European Commission announced a relaxation of state aid rules at the start of the crisis, and president Ursula von der Leyen said last week that it had so far approved €1.8 trillion (£1.5 trillion) in national aid to companies.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Clearly there will need to be political movement on the EU side to move negotiations forward, particularly on fisheries and level playing field issues, in order to help find a balanced solution which reflects the political realities on both sides.”The spokesman added: “What the EU is seeking to do is impose conditions upon us which are not required in other FTAs which it has agreed with sovereign countries around the world.”Asked whether the UK has yet submitted its position on fisheries, the spokesman said: “We are not going to put anything on the table just for the sake of it. We need the EU to understand our position, which is that we will be a sovereign state which has control of its own fishing waters. Our position was set out in the document which we published two months or so ago in relation to what we are seeking from the future partnership.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Just six per cent of the public were unsupportive. Under such a scheme the state would find jobs for people on public works or link them up with private sector employers.Case for basic income ‘strengthened’ by coronavirus, says SturgeonSpain to be first European country to roll out universal basic incomeOver 170 MPs and Lords call for universal basic income during pandemicA similar policy has previously been proposed by some economists as a way to control unemployment, with Labour\u0027s 2015 manifesto under Ed Miliband containing a version of the policy that emphasised its compulsory nature. Today\u0027s survey found strong support for the guarantee across all demographics.51 per cent of the public also support a universal basic income, where the government makes sure everyone has an income, without a means test or requirement to work. Just 24 per cent are unsupportive of the idea, with 9 per cent saying they do not know how they feel.The idea a basic income has been backed by dozens of MPs from across the political spectrum as a solution to workers falling through the cracks of the current government support scheme - including the self-employed. Former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith has however criticised the idea, suggesting it would be a disincentive to work during the crisis and would be badly targeted.Tory voters were the least enthusiastic about a basic income, with only narrow support - 39 per cent in favour to 37 per cent opposed.Labour last week rejected the idea of a universal basic income during the Covi-19 crisis, with a spokesperson for Keir Starmer stating that “creating an entirely new social security system is unlikely to be possible during the crisis. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has previously toyed with the policy and suggested Labour could have piloted the idea if elected.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This policy was supported by 74 per cent of the public with just 8 per cent unsupportive.Voters from all parties supported the policy by large margins, with little variations between different demographics. Britain is unusual in Europe in having no controls at all on its rents since they were abolished in the 1980s.Created with Sketch.High noon in a coronavirus-stricken world Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, part of The Grand Palace)An empty street leading to the historic Old Town SquareLawn stretching towards the Capitol, home of CongressA watch showing the time in front of Damascus GateThe Houses of Parliament seen from Westminster BridgeEmpty lanes in the city that saw the first outbreak of diseaseThe Malecon road and esplanade winds along the city\u0027s seafrontA little busier than elsewhere: midday traffic in Tahrir SquareThe Brandenburg Gate, the only surviving city gate in the capitalBolivar Avenue, opened in 1949 and the site of many demonstrations and ralliesSpasskaya Tower (left) on the eastern wall of the Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s CathedralThe harbourside Eminonu district is usually buzzing with activityRajpath, a ceremonial boulevard that runs through the capitalThe Roman amphitheatre that dates back to the 2nd century ADThe main concourse of Grand Central station in ManhattanMaidan Nezalezhnosti, the site of many political protests since the end of the Soviet eraThe odd walker out in the midday sun on Ring Road CentralA man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, part of The Grand Palace)An empty street leading to the historic Old Town SquareLawn stretching towards the Capitol, home of CongressA watch showing the time in front of Damascus GateThe Houses of Parliament seen from Westminster BridgeEmpty lanes in the city that saw the first outbreak of diseaseThe Malecon road and esplanade winds along the city\u0027s seafrontA little busier than elsewhere: midday traffic in Tahrir SquareThe Brandenburg Gate, the only surviving city gate in the capitalBolivar Avenue, opened in 1949 and the site of many demonstrations and ralliesSpasskaya Tower (left) on the eastern wall of the Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s CathedralThe harbourside Eminonu district is usually buzzing with activityRajpath, a ceremonial boulevard that runs through the capitalThe Roman amphitheatre that dates back to the 2nd century ADThe main concourse of Grand Central station in ManhattanMaidan Nezalezhnosti, the site of many political protests since the end of the Soviet eraThe odd walker out in the midday sun on Ring Road CentralFatima Ibrahim from campaign group Green New Deal UK, which commissioned the polling, said, “Huge numbers of Brits believe that the country was ill-prepared for this pandemic, just as it is ill-prepared for climate breakdown.The need for a new deal for this country is clear - and sky high support for policies like a jobs guarantee and rent freezes shows that there is no going back to the economy built on the shaky foundations we had before.If your house fell down, you would rebuild the bits you love, but you would also deal with the leaky roof and draughty windows.

The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.

Will. Never. Happen.I adore the show and am glad it is on track toas usual later this year.But I know I would be very, very bad – and not in a funny Ed Ballsy way.I’d just be embarrassingly woeful. At the age of , I don’t want to be dragged around the dancefloor by the long-suffering Anton du Beck, showing off my knickers like Ann Widdecombe.I reckon the idea I might be involved in Strictly all started because of the ­glorious pro dancer Luba Mushtuk, who was paired with Olympic rower James Cracknell, last year and exited far too soon.We met each other at the Jason Vale health retreat, below, in February, where people go to recharge their batteries.It feels like a letime ago that we were all enjoying long walks, yoga and exercise classes, making new friends along the way.Luba very kindly gave us all a Strictly masterclass. I’ll never forget the hilarious lessons out in the sunshine – with a view of the lakes and hearing everyone’s laughter.Although I really enjoyed myself, it made me realise I could never, ever be a contestant on Strictly.My role is to watch the show from the comfort of my sofa with a large glass of wine and a jumbo bag of Revels.It is easy to criticise the ministers and health experts fighting Covid-.They must make le-or-death decisions with the information available and haven’t always got it right.But they are also human beings.This week England’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Dr Jenny Harries, told me she had been struck down by the virus, probably the day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson tested positive, and it left her feeling frail.With classic understatement, she called it an “unpleasant” experience.She was looked after by her children, one of whom is a junior doctor, and had to stay off work for ten days.This will have given her even greater insight into the disease and empathy with patients and their families.But it also makes us realise that behind the daily pm briefings are real people just trying to do their best.I’M still baffled by what to do when it comes to wearing a face mask.EvenI could get one, I don’t want to deprive a worker in the NHS, a care home or public transport, as these grafters are the priorities.We are told by some thatwe stay at home, and social-distance when we go out to the shops or for a bit of exercise, we don’t need to wear a mask.But that can feel problematicyou’re out shopping or on a bus or train.I will be making my own mask from the simple DIY instructions printed in The Sun earlier this week – it will be much better than nothing.But right now, there’s confusion and doubt, and it must be cleared up fast.NO ONE wants to put extra pressure on the NHS, and figures show we haven’t been going to AE or phoning ambulances unless we’re severely ill, which is laudable.But you can go too far.I would urge anyone who happens upon a lump or something suspicious to get help right away.Cancer specialists report a drastic fall in the number of people seeking help and fear a huge increase in cancer cases.So don’t think you are being a nuisance.A drastic, unexplained weight loss, a lump or change in a breast, or anything amiss with the testicles, must NEVER be ignored.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In Sweden, they say that everyone should rub up against one another when shopping, while in France they are ­ordering everyone to stay inside for another three weeks. Some boffins say that testing is the answer to Covid-. Some say it isn’t.Some say  is the age where you most need to worry. Some say it’s .Some say the virus will be wiped out by summer weather. Others say it won’t.And meanwhile, everyone is sitting at home thinking, “Can you lot make up your bloody minds.”But that’s the point of science. There should never be a ­consensus.Everything should constantly move as new discoveries are made. Emc until someone proves that it doesn’t.My colleague Rod Liddle explained last weekend that when the first atom bomb was about to be tested, none of the utterly brilliant men who’d designed it could agree on what would happen.Some said the explosion would be small. Some said it would be massive.One thought it might set the ­atmosphere on fire. One said it wouldn’t work at all.Today, we are told that all of science is agreed on global warming.We hear it IS happening and it IS our fault. No argument is allowed.History has taught us that this is ­dangerous.A hundred years ago, someone came up with a new idea called eugenics.The idea was that the human race was doomed because too many black and ­stupid people were having babies.We can see now that this is lazy, racist nonsense but back then it was a ­dferent story.Boffins at all the most prestigious ­institutions in America were captivated by it.They worked on it at Yale and ­Hard. Millions was spent on research.The greatest minds were taken in, Nobel Prize winners among them.HG Wells supported it and so did George Bernard Shaw and Alexander ­Graham Bell.Legislation was passed to promote it.Winston Churchill believed in it, as did US presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow ­Wilson.So just like global warming, we had an idea backed by leading politicians and many top celebrities.And anyone who said it was stupid was told to shut up.“We have science on our side” they screamed.Yeah, but they also had Hitler on their side.He believed so ­passionately in eugenics, he came up with the Aryan Nation, built concentration camps and murdered six ­million Jews.Be glad then that scientists can’t agree on what to do about Covid-.It shows they are ­thinking. When they say they all agree, it shows they’re not.EVERY European country has dferent ideas about which businesses can re-open next week and which ones cannot.But they’d all really like to give the green light to one thing: Hairdressers.I realise, of course, that everyone has now reverted to their original hair colour and that in Scotland it’s easy to spot the ginger roots of recession.But I just can’t see why this matters so much. And then I saw that picture of Pierce Brosnan . . .TO mark something called Earth Day , Prince Charles has said that in future we should put the “people and the planet” first.Hmmm. Not sure that’s going to work. Because what the planet wants and what people want are two very dferent things.What people want is to be warm and comfortable. We also want to be happy, which means we want a new sofa from DFS, a nice car, a couple of holidays every year and a fridge full of ice-cold beer.Charles would probably argue that the “people” he’s talking about are those who live in mud huts in Africa and Asia and bits of South America.Right. So what do they want  Well, I’m fairly sure thatyou asked them, they’d say they’d like a new sofa, a nice car, a holiday or two and a fridge full of ice-cool beer.That means we must build power stations and roads for them.We must dam their rivers and pull down their jungles to make way for sewerage and water pipes and factories and hospitals and shopping centres.I’m fairly confident then thatwe put people first, the planet is going to feel like we’ve trodden on its toe.I WAS out on my tractor this week, doing a safe and steady mph on a narrow country lane, when I noticed in one of the seven rear view mirrors that behind me, there was a small army of cyclists who couldn’t get past.Ooh, I was happy.I was so happy in fact, that when I got home, I drove right past the drive so that I could keep them all behind me a little bit longer.Payback.It’s so, so sweet.COUNCIL chiefs in Manchester say that the city has been so lovely and quiet these past few weeks that they are thinking of banning cars for ever.Really  You want to stop all those Cheshire boys coming into the city centre on a Friday night with their Ferraris and Bentleys Good luck with that.THIS week, we read about a builder who’d kept his we happy by turning his dumper truck into a luxury bath.He’d even used a drill attachment to create bubbles.Very clever but I knew a man in Doncaster back in the day who made his kids a swimming pool out of a skip.He tilted it so there was a deep end and even put a brazier underneath, so it was fully heated.WHETHER you’re doing a house-party or video conferencing with colleagues, it’s critically important you get the background correct.Tory MPs using Skype to do interviews on the evening news usually put themselves in front of a book case.This tells us they are wise and well read.Celebrities usually make sure there’s a bit of zebra skin in the shot and a pickled shark or two on the wall.This week, my friend Trinny Woodall hosted a live online make-up tutorial from her bathroom.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Doubtless she made sure the background was spick and span. And it was. Right up to the moment when her partner, Charles, , walked into the back of shot. Naked. Stuff like that can happen to anyone who’s not careful.Last week, I hosted an online general knowledge quiz. No one got any of the questions right. They were all too busy staring at the mountain of champagne over my shoulder.Tragically, I’d bought it for the guests at my th birthday party a couple of weeks ago.

Is raising taxes the wrong approach or the Governments only option One surprise of this crisis has been how easily Britons have accepted the lockdown . Some people seem to positively enjoy it.To some it brings back the spirit of the Blitz a feeling of solidarity. To others fewer cars and planes are an indication of the more green lestyle we ought to be living.Its good that people have managed to cope with these restrictions. But when polls indicate that many people would be prepared to put up with a y extension of the lockdown I begin to worry.An economic interruption of this kind carries massive costs and can only be borne for a limited period. Any extension will become extremely dficult for the economy to bear.The OBR, the Governments independent forecaster, floated the possibility of a fall in output of the economy of  per cent for the period April to June.That is beyond anything that has previously been imagined. It wasn’t a definite forecast butit happened the effects on jobs and living standards would be more than devastating.Some describe this economic crisis as the worst in modern times. It may be the worst ever. That doesn’t mean we cant recover. We can and we certainly will.But its important to be patient. Commentators talk about the economy bouncing back, a so called V shaped recovery.This seems unlikely The economy may bounce back but only up to a certain point not necessarily the same point as before. Some firms will have gone out of business, others will have run up debts, some have missed orders that aren’t repeated.How long all these problems last depends on the lockdown. The longer the lockdown, the deeper the downturn. So it is vitally urgent that the Government relax the lockdown as soon as the scientists feel that the peak of the epidemic has been flattened and that it is appropriate.This isn’t about choosing the economy or lives. A flattened economy costs lives too. Even when we relax the lockdown many will still be nervous and may not want to go out to spend money.The continuing need for social distancing will pose problems for hospitality and other businesses and hold back a full recovery. Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor has been bold, promising to do “whatever it takes” to steer the economy through these perilous waters.His scheme for furloughing jobs with the Government paying up to £ a month of peoples wages has helped to prevent firms getting rid of people that they could not afford But it is eye wateringly expensive with costs estimated at up to £billion.Clearly it cannot continue indefinitely. Ironically the generosity of the scheme may have anaesthetised the public to the scale of the crisis we are facing.Butthe Government lts some of the restrictions soon and the economy starts to recover , what should the Chancellor do in his Budget in November  Of course we don’t know exactly what the figures will look like and we must wait to see before final judgements.Almost certainly he will be confronting a massively reduced economy, groaning under skyscraping debt, higher unemployment and only a gradual recovery.Horric as the borrowing figures will be it would be a mistake to move quickly to reduce the debt before the recovery is firmly established.He should let borrowing take the strain in the short term. Any measures to rein in the deficit should be for later. In order to boost jobs he might cut National Insurance or make a temporary cut in VAT designed to bring forward spending.Keir Starmer gave a menacing hint of his approach when he said there would have to be “a day of reckoning” and hinted at tax increases on the better off as though they were to blame.That would be precisely the wrong approach. As the economy gets back to maybe  per cent of where it was before the Chancellor needs to do all he can to support business.He has recently given some generous help to new high tech start ups. Well and good, but it will be important to continue to support existing businesses.It should never be forgotten that firms that have failed in this crisis have not failed though any fault of their own. This down turn is not a normal recession caused by market forces, a rise in interest rates or overheating.No this recession and the bankruptcies have been caused by the Government’s measures rightly introduced to contain the virus. So the Government should not feel embarrassed about continuing some of their schemes to support inidual businesses and indeed they have a duty to do so.The Chancellor sets the framework but ultimately growth does not come from Governments, it comes from iniduals and firms. The way to growth and recovery is to give them the freedom and the incentives and the rest will follow.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers. The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM. No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here: www.thesun whocareswinsappeal.Raising taxes in the current climate is not something the Government is likely to want to do.But the scale of the economic crisis now gripping the UK means they may end up feeling they have little option.So far the Chancellor has done what he had to do to protect businesses and workers from enforced shutdowns. The cost will have to come from somewhere.It is estimated the furloughing scheme alone will cost at least £billion. At the same time, tax receipts have noseed as earnings have decreased and fewer people are spending in the shops.As a result, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that public- sector borrowing will increase by an eye-watering £billion above the earlier forecast.The black hole in the country’s finances left by Covid- means that at some point, the Chancellor is going to have to face the uncomfortable issue of whether taxes will go up.Any rises must be set against the need to ensure nothing chokes the ­economic recovery, which will be vital.We must also guard against hitting the most hard-up in society. And ­crucially, we need to ensure we don’t make it unprofitable for dynamic small companies to operate.One option for the Chancellor is to target the big multi-nationals and billionaires who use tax havens to avoid paying their fair share.Yet we will also need to have big business on our side as we try to recover, so it is a delicate balancing act.Our priority right now still has to be protecting the vulnerable and health workers from another Covid- outbreak.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.But it is time too for the Government to think seriously about how to restart the economy as quickly as possible.Two days ago came news that Jaguar and Aston Martin will restart production in May. The Chancellor needs to help other companies follow suit.The more successful he is, the likelier he will be able to limit the number of extra taxes he has to raise in the months ahead.We are backing a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.” SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the dam is bursting.The trickle back to work is turning into a flood. People are still keeping their distance, but they are taking their hard hats on the Tube, visiting garden centres, coffee shops, parks — and, best of all, reuniting with their families.When Boris Johnson s from his sick bed on Monday, he must get ahead of this fast- moving curve. He needs to show he is back in charge.The PM has plans, yet to be announced, for “non-essential” stores to open. Next will be schools. This will be the “new normal”. Perhaps they should never have been shut in the first place.Polls show people will self-isolate, risk their jobs and keep indoors to save the NHSasked — but not land their children and grandchildren with the bill.They will endure a few more days of enforced sunshine but six weeks is long enough.Britain’s death toll has passed , — among Europe’s highest but far below last month’s scary , worst-case scenario.Lockdown has worked. It has taken pressure off the NHS. The “sombrero” curve has been flattened.Crucially, we now have spare hospital capacity and, despite a shortage of protective equipment, our NHS frontline has avoided meltdown.Yet we continue to hear the dismal dirge, “Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives”, to the muffled drums of the BBC and its throat-slitting Thought For The Day.While some are breaking those rules, many more — especially the over-s — are too terried to poke their nose outdoors evenit’s safe.So non-Covid hospital wards are empty and countless worried patients are missing le-saving treatment for cancer, kidney or heart disease.Others in lockdown are prone to mental health problems, suicide and fast-rising domestic brutality. More might die because of lockdown than from Covid- itself.The economy, meanwhile, is on le support. The UK “jobs miracle” is merely a memory. Some will leave lockdown to find their jobs gone, perhaps for ever.The Treasury’s mammoth multi-billion support scheme will leave crippling long-term economic wounds.One in four firms has stopped trading and Britain risks its worst economic slump in centuries.We are not alone. The Eurozone is fighting for its le. We may be witnessing the end of the single currency, an event which would send seismic waves around the world.THE furore over Covid- has temporarily eclipsed Brexit but the wrangle goes on.Strutting peacock Michel Barnier, used to getting his own way with Theresa May, has yet to discover the game is up. He wants Britain to give Brussels the same powers over UK trade and fishing aswe were still a vassal state.Barnier has yet to learn the shoe is on the other foot. Britain is now a sovereign trading nation.Europe is a busted flush. We leavenecessary without a deal. End of story.Russia, Nigeria and the Gulf states are being ravaged by the oil price collapse. Dirt-poor families in Africa and Asia — reliant on cash sent home by migrant children — are seeing those lelines severed overnight.In America, where Depression-style unemployment is close to million, the revolt against lockdown is already under way.Lockdown is prolonging the worldwide agony. This email from Cambridge post office manager and Sun reader Rob Swt sums up the view of many baffled Sun readers. Rob says: “We allow customers in to match the number serving and everyone has PPE.“At no point has anybody had symptoms or gone absent through coronavirus. We use our common sense then go home to our families before doing it all again the next day.“Along with supermarkets, building sites and some small shops, we have been open throughout and at no point have cases risen to the extent we have had to close down.”If lockdown continues for too long, many of those one- in-four firms which have already stopped trading will not reopen. High streets will look like a row of rotten teeth. Some school children will never catch up.On his first day back at work on Monday, the Prime Minister faces a tough challenge.An earlyto work will provoke left-wing charges that money means more than lives to the Tories.

tests haven’t been able to get the tests they need.More than ten million essential workers and their households are now able to get checked for COVID-, as the Government races to hit its own , daily testing target by Thursday.But for people who are live remotely or are too sick to get to a drive-through centre, there is very little capacity.Health Secretary Matt Hancock has blamed lack of demand, rather than lack of capacity, on not ramping up testing faster.As of . this morning, home testing kits were unavailable on the gov.uk coronavirus website.Slots open daily at am.No confirmed today , kits were ordered this morning.People are still able to book to get tested at drive-through centres in England and Scotland, but slots in Wales and Northern Ireland were listed as unavailable.To help hit Government testing targets, all health and social care workers, police officers, teachers, social workers, undertakers, journalists and supermarket and food production staff are now able to get tested.Mr Hancock said any essential worker who could benefit from a test, will be able to get a test.British Medical Association chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said there was no point setting up the online booking systemit didnt have enough capacity.He said: What we found in the first two days was that within an hour the bookings had all been taken up, and therefore offered no practical help for large numbers of healthcare staff.If the Government wants healthcare workers to have access to the test, it has to be in the context or providing adequate capacity, not a first come, first served and closing within an hour.Thats not delivering on the needs of our health and care staff.Dr Nagpaul added the testing capacity was well, well short of the number of healthcare staff currently self-isolating. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social care said there has been signicant demand for booking tests and officials are working hard to increase availability.Chairman of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory GroupProfessor Peter Horby said the Governments plans to focus on tracking and tracing new cases of infections would be a real logistical challenge.Nervtag is one of the groups advising ministers on the coronavirus crisis.Professor Horby told BBC Radio : The test and trace capabilities are really going to be critical as we come out of

the half brother of previous leader Kim Jong-il - has recently ed to the secretive state after spending  years living overseas as a diplomat.With ongoing rumours of Kims death or failing health, experts have said his uncles re-emergence on the stage of North Korean politics could complicate the succession - with Kims sister Kim Yo-jong believed to be the next in line.Pyong-il was considered a threat even by his older brother, which is one of the reasons he spent so long abroad - being North Koreas ambassador to Finland, Bulgaria, Hungary and Poland.Reportedly he was once considered to rule alongside Kim Jong-il by their dad Kim Il-sung, potentially being made head of the military while his brother took over the party.He is said to have been a popular figure in Pyongyang before his apparent exile - known for hosting parties where people would chant his name.China are also reportedly also keen on Pyong-il, considering him an alternative should regime change occur in North Korea.The -year-old ed to Pyongyang last summer as he retired as a diplomat, and is reportedly popular due to his resemblance to his resemblance to his dad Kim Il-sung.North Korean society is built upon a cult of personality around the Kims, and something seemingly as trivial as appearance may go a long way with the kingmakers in the regime.Meanwhile, Yo-jong has been positioned as Kims alter ego in recent years, taking an increasingly prominent position alongside her brother.It is possible Kims death could spark a brutal Game of Thrones-esque conflict to establish his successor.North Korea however today released a letter said to be written by Kim - but no new pictures - as the mystery deepens.Professor John Blaxland, an expert on North Korea, said Pyong-ils gender may make him a preferable choice over his niece.He told ABC: Its a fascinating development to see Kim Pyong-il re-emerge on the stage.That certainly will complicate Kim Yo-jongs apparent aspirations, but points to something that was expected: a reluctance of the establishment — military, security leaders and the Kim family — to depart from the patriarchal predisposition.Dr Malcolm Davis, from Australias Strategic Policy Institute, added: Kim Yo-jong is clearly likely to claim leadership … but whether the North Korean factions will accept a female leader … is uncertain.Other experts have however disagreed that sexism may play a role in stopping Yo-jongs ascension.North Korea expert Sean King said any leader must be a blood relative, and currently Yo-jong is in pole position.The -year-old is one of her brothers closest aides, helped cultivate his image and playing a key role in Kims historic meetings with Donald Trump.Mr King said: Shes clearly being groomed for something. If Kim Pyong-il was the man for the job, hed have likely gotten it previously.Kim has not been seen in public since April  and rumours are running wild on his possible demise.Reports from the US, China, South Korea and Japan have speculated there is something wrong with the North Korean leader - including a botched heart surgery, an injury during a missile test, or a collapse while walking in the countryside.Chinese journalist Shijian Xingzou said a “very solid source” told her the North Korean leader had died.She has  million followers on Chinese social media site Weibo, and she is also the niece of one of the the countrys foreign ministers.South Korea have however insisted that Kim is alive and well, and other reports have suggested his vanishing is down to him weathering the coronavirus storm at his private resort in Wonsan.US President Donald Trump has said he believes reports are incorrect, but then one of his advisors told Fox News that Kim is most likely dead or incapacitated.Kims health has long been in question - with the dictator believed to be a binge eater, heavy drinker and chain smoker potentially weighing up to  stone.Pictures have also emerged allegedly showing Kim lying in state, but these have been faked based on images from his dads funeral in .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One of the tribe members told me about when her grandfather died...they ritually ate his leg.Describing his journey to the tribe, Alexey said he was dropped off by aircraft piloted by the Peruvian army. He said: I then travelled by boat upstream for two days and reached the Matses tribe near the Brazilian border.I feel really at home there.

Demuzh and tattoos also arose as a protection against kidnapping by other tribes. It was a way of self-identication.Because of the tribe’s remote location, they have been able to retain many of their traditional ways.In Peru, there is no government organisation to protect indigenous minorities. The Matses have survived only because of their isolation.Alexey said: We have to learn more about these cultures.

We have asked experts to look into this as a matter of urgency and I know the Secretary of State is concerned, as he said.It comes as the Paediatric Intensive Care Society sent an alert to GPs warning of a spike in cases of a mystery condition across the UK.The new inflammatory syndrome has lead to a rise in the number of children needing intensive care treatment.They said the symptoms appear similar to that of severe Covid-, adding youngsters have complained of abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea.Medics warned the new condition mimics toxic shock syndrome, and atypical Kawasaki disease - a condition that causes heart inflammation and attacks the blood vessels.Prof Whitty said while the number of cases is very small it does warrant further investigation.This is a very rare situation but I think its entirely plausible its caused by this virus at least in some cases, he said.We know that in adults, who of course have much more disease than children do, big problems are caused by an inflammatory process and this looks rather like an inflammatory process just a rather dferent one.Therefore given that we have got a new presentation at a time of a new disease the possibility, its not definite we need to look for other causes as well, but the possibility there is a link is plausible.But the numbers are very small, key thing isparents are worried then phone up and get advice. It is very rare.NHS doctors have been told to watch out for signs of an inflammatory syndrome in kids, after a rise in cases of the new condition.Health chiefs said in an alert to GPs the signs include:The mysterious condition has been compared to toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease.The signs of TSS are:Signs of Kawaski disease include: Cases have only started to emerge in the past three weeks - as the country reached the peak of its epidemic, according to the memo.And as it appears to be a completely new condition, the exact warning signs are unclear.In some cases children have tested positive for coronavirus, while in others kids appear to have had the virus weeks earlier.Meanwhile, some children have not tested positive for coronavirus - but it is unclear whether all had been tested.In the alert, sent to GPs in North London, health chiefs said: “There is growing concern that a [Covid-] related inflammatory syndrome is emerging in children in the UK.Over the last three weeks, there has been an apparent rise in the number of children of all ages presenting with a multi-system inflammatory state requiring intensive care across London and also in other regions of the UK.Its unclear whether the mysterious syndrome is slow to develop or is so rare that it has only become apparent during the peak of the epidemic in the UK.So far, the number of children affected has been small - and mostly in London - but senior paediatricians are concerned.The “urgent alert”, seen by the Health Service Journal, was issued on Sunday night by the Paediatric Intensive Care Society.It stated: “Please refer children presenting with these symptoms as a matter of urgency.”Prof Powis said tonight it is important that new conditions like this are identied and doctors are encouraged to report cases.He said it means experts can be instructed to look into clusters to seethey can establish any link.Were not sure at the moment, its really too early to say whether there is a link.Prof Powis urged any worried parents to contact NHS their child is ill, to call a GP or dial  in an emergency.Although very rare, and I must emphasise how rare this is,that you come forward to seek treatment and diagnosis as quickly as possible.Earlier today, NHS England said there is no established link between Covid- and Kawasaki-like diseases.Prof Simon Kenny, NHS national clinical director for children and young people, said: “Thankfully Kawasaki-like diseases are very rare, as currently are serious complications in children related to Covid-.But it is important that clinicians are made aware of any potential emerging links so that they are able to give children and young people the right care fast.“The advice to parents remains the same:you are worried about your child for whatever reason, contact NHS  or your family doctor for urgent advice, or  in an emergency, anda professional tells you to go to hospital, please go to hospital.”Professor Russell Viner, President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: We already know that a very small number of children can become severely ill with Covid- but this is very rare.Evidence from throughout the world shows us that children appear to be the part of the population least affected by this infection.New diseases may present in ways that surprise us, and clinicians need to be made aware of any emerging evidence of particular symptoms or of underlying conditions which could make a patient more vulnerable to the virus.Dr Sarah Jarvis, GP and clinical director of Patient Access, told The Sun Online: “On the whole, most children who are infected with coronavirus have a milder illness than adults, particularly older and more vulnerable patients.There has been a recent warning to GPs to be on the look-out for children with coronavirus-type symptoms – cough and fever – as well as tummy symptoms such as tummy pain, diarrhoea and vomiting.There is a concern that this could be an unusual complication of coronavirus.She added: Its important to stress thatthis does turn out to be a complication of coronavirus, it’s likely to be a rare one.But parents of any child who seems very unwell should always seek medical help.The NHS is very much open for business for urgent problems, whether connected to coronavirus or not.Frontline.Live gives health workers the opportunity to say what specic PPE they need and where manufacturers can help, and hopes to match medical staff with the relevant suppliers across the country.According to the latest data from the , PPE needs are highest in the Midlands, London and the South West.Figures also show that gownsand safety glasses visorsare the most in-demand items across the board.From the suppliers who have registered, % can provide safety glasses visors, and % can provide gowns to NHS staff in need.Frontline.live, set up by a team of dedicated volunteers, is free to sign up to, and over  suppliers have already joined to help NHS heroes.Dr Elizabeth Whittaker, a paediatrician at St Marys Hospital in London, said that medics in other countries had reported the same illness.She wrote on Twitter: Our Italian and Spanish colleagues also report it.

The Trade Union Congress has set out measures which it wants employers to follow before it can they get people back to work. It comes as the body released polling which shows that  in workers surveyed, along with those who have recently become unemployed, are worried about ing to the normal place of work, including halfof women. The same number are concerned about not being able to socially distance from colleagues when back at work, and over a quarterare concerned about not being able to socially distance from customers or clients. Over a thirdare concerned about exposing others in their household to greater risk. And early  in workers across the economy are concerned about not having access to appropriate personal protective equipmentat work. So what is it that the TUC want  A risk assessment in every workplace The core of the TUC demands is that every workplace should carry out a specic Covid- risk assessment. And it should set out specic steps, including enforcing social distancing and what extra safety precautions and equipment is necessary for the government to do its jobs. They then want this arrangement about ing to be agreed by the staff trade union and have it signed off by a health and safety expert. PPE provided where necessary They are calling for all necessary personal protective equipmentto be provided and insist that no one should be asked to re-use PPE inappropriately. Where risk assessments show that PPE is necessary, employers must provide this, and no-one, including Public Health England, should require health and social care workers to re-use PPE.  Specic advice for those at most risk The TUC is calling for the Government to provide specic advice and protection for those groups most at risk. This includes workers advised to ‘shield’ and those who are pregnant. If these workers cannot work safely, their livelihoods must be protected, they demand. And they must monitor the effects of these changes on workers from groups with protected characteristics - like black workers and pregnant women. Punish companies who force people to work in unsafe environments Trade unionists are calling on the Health and Safety Executiveto apply sanctions to employers that do not risk assess for Covid- or fail to provide safe working arrangements. Alongside this, they demand that the HSE run a public information campaign to ensure workers know their rights and extra resources to make inspections quicker. Where companies fail to act, the TUC say that the HSE should prosecute them. Reforming support for schemes to keep people in work The governmentaposs furlough support scheme has kept many people in work through this crisis, but the TUC say it must be made more flexible as Britain s to work. This means allowing the scheme to protect short-time working, to enable people toto work gradually. They also say the scheme must protec those who cannot work, including those who are shielding or caring for someone shielding, parents who cannot work while schools are closed, and those who are ordered to self-isolate by the contact-tracing And that the rate of sick pay and universal credit should be raised to the equivalent of a week’s pay at the real living wage, and £ respectively. The five week UC wait time must also be axed.  Why is this necessary  According to TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady too often decent employers are let down by those who play fast and loose with safety. She said: “We need tough new measures from government to reassure working people that their health and safety is a priority. Too many workers have already been forced to put their health on the line during this pandemic. “We all want everyone to get back to work and start rebuilding Britain. But workers need confidence that they won’t have to put themselves or their families at unnecessary risk. “Government must ensure that every employer performs a comprehensive risk assessment before asking staff toto work. And bosses who don’t take steps to protect workers should be prosecuted. “If workers are asked to work in conditions they think are unsafe, they can refuse. And they should know that their unions will have their back.”  "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus lockdown exit plan due","story":"NewsCoronavirus lockdown exit plan to allow family gatherings again in social bubblesThe UK is entering phase two of the pandemic according to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Mirror understands an option on the table is allowing the expansion of social bubblesShareCommentsByGraham HiscottHead of BusinessBen GlazeDeputy Political EditorPippa Crerar:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video boris-johnson-says-uk-making-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics coronavirus-lockdown-exit-plan-due-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Boris Johnson, on his first day back at work after his own battle with ­Covid-, announced he will this week unveil the first steps to easing the restrictions aimed at beating the virus.The Mirror understands one option on the table is allowing people to expand their “social bubbles” so they could see some friends and family. But the PM warned the UK was still at “maximum risk” from the disease and now was not the right time to end the lockdown totally – which could lead to a dangerous second peak and ­thousands more fatalities. Downing Street also warned that in some areas there could be a toughening of the restrictions – including a -day quarantine on new arrivals at British ports and airports.It came as Rishi Sunak revealed the lockdown is having dire consequences for businesses, with a quarter of all firms having stopped trading.The Chancellor announced a new “micro loans scheme” to help small companies in trouble. As the death rate on Monday rose by  to ,, Mr Johnson ­promised to give more details “in the coming days” about how to ease the ­restrictions. One possibility is two ­separate households, or couples who don’t live together, may be able to spend time together. But grandparents who live in a dferent town from grandchildren would still have to wait until ­restrictions are eased further to be able to see them. Ministers are expected to discuss plans to keep ­non-essential ­businesses free from coronavirus so they can reopen in the weeks ahead.Mr Johnson acknowledged there were signs the UK was “passing through the peak” of the outbreak and coming to the end of the first phase. Monday was the first time the daily hospital death toll has been below  since last month. But the PM said: “Dficult ­judgments will be made and we cannot spell out now how fast or slow or even when those changes will be made.” And Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty admitted the Government faced “some very dficult choices” to keep the ­transmission rate low. Downing Street said any changes to the lockdown would involve “refining” it rather than lting it completely. A spokesman said: “There could be easing in some areas. There could also be a toughening in other areas.”  Ministers plan to recommend wearing face masks on public ­transport, at the shops and in some workplaces. Some football matches and other sports fixtures could resume but would be played behind closed doors and televised.  The Treasury is also looking at how small non-essential business such as garden centres could resume trading. Opening of schools is not expected to be addressed publicly before the next review on May , although there is some optimism among officials they could reopen in June. The business loan announced by Mr Sunak will range from a minimum of £, to £, and firms must have been up and running before the start of March to be eligible. Former minister Theresa Villiers urged him “to publish a road map to release from the lockdown so that businesses can start to prepare for a phased modication and a safe exit from the emergency measures”. Global stock markets staged a £billion rally yesterday as other countries began easing restrictions. But the FTSE  index had a £billion rise, despite our own ­lockdown not yet being lted. The Government is ramping up its “test and trace” strategy, with Matt Hancock claiming the UK was “on track” to deliver on his promise of , a day by the end of the week. But they hit just , tests yesterday.

Out of , questions submitted to be the first asked at the briefing, pollster YouGov picked Lyn from Skipton, who asked when she would be able to hug her grandchildren. She wrote: “Iaposm missing my grandchildren so much. Please can you let me know , after the five criteria are met, is being able to hug our closest family one of the first steps out of lockdown  The Health Secretary immediately passed the question to Chief Medical Office Chris Whitty. Professor Whitty said the answer would depend on whether she has a signicant medical problem in a way that means she has to be shielding and sheaposs an older person. ”If sheaposs in a group thataposs vulnerable, then the answer is it might well be prudent - and this will depend entirely on inidual circumstances - for her not to get into a situation where sheaposs putting herself at risk, he continued. The overall view that actually one of the things that is clearly important to everybody is the ability to get together with families remotely but also physically everyone fully accepts. Nevertheless it is important that people who are vulnerable continue to be protected even after whatever the next steps are.

The aposBounce Backapos loans will be backed by a % government guarantee, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said. The top Tory said it was the latest move to shield the economy and workers from the coronavirus shutdown. But it comes after the Government faced weeks of criticism for slow progress in getting government-backed credit to companies. And as recently as last week, Mr Sunak opposed % government guarantees - suggesting the % guarantee on an existing loan scheme was enough. Hereaposs how the new loans work and how to apply.What has changed  Under the existing scheme, Coronavirus Business Interruption Loansworth up to £m are offered to small firms with a certain level of turnover. But they are only backed by the government up to %, leading to a flood of complaints that firms were struggling to get the money out of lenders. Chancellor Rishi Sunak made reforms to CBIL, but he still faced calls to raise the guarantee from % to %. Instead, he has decided to launch a brand new scheme with % guarantees, but worth a much smaller £,.  Why did it need a new scheme  Sources suggested the dference was one of scale. CBILS is worth up to £million per firm - meaning % guarantees would have been more expensive for the government. The other issue is speed. Having a smaller cash amount means there can be fewer checks and the money can go out of the door more quickly. How will the new loans work  Businesses will be able to borrow between £, and £,, with the risk underwritten by the government. The aim is to make it much faster for the cash to get to smaller businesses, who have seen delays going through regulation checks from banks.  How much are they worth  According to Rishi Sunak: Businesses will be able to apply for these new bounce back loans for % of their turnover up to a maximum of £,. The government will cover interest and fees for the first year, with firms expected to repay the loans for five years after that. Sources insisted the interest rate - which some lenders were accused of inflating under CBIL - will be very low. When can you apply for them and where  The scheme will launch for applications on Monday  May and firms will be able to access these loans through lenders accredited through the British Business Bank. The loans will be available from am with no forward-looking test of business viability, no complex eligibility criteria, just a simple, quick standard form for businesses to fill in. Firms are expected to get funding within  hours of applying. Does my firm qualy  There is no limit on a firm’s turnover and firms do not need to show proof of turnover. But sources expect only smaller firms will apply because of the limit on funds. How will they help small businesses  The government says it has designed the scheme to be fast, and affordable. Banks have reportedly agreed on low-interest rates with the government, who will cover those payments for the first year. The % backing from the Treasury will also allow the banks to carry out fewer checks, although they will still be subject to fraud investigations, meaning they should be approved quickly.

Boris Johnson pledged this morning that more details on changing lockdown laws would be revealed in the coming days. Labour leader Keir Starmer has called for for ministers to treat the public like adults about the easing of social distancing measures.No said this lunchtime that aposphase twoapos could see measures eased and others tightened. A Downing Street spokesperson said: There could be easing in some areas. There could also be a toughening in other areas. We will not be ing immediately to le as we knew it.People will have to acclimatise themselves to a new normal. The Prime Minister, in his first statement since ing to work after battling the bug himself, repeatedly stressed that now isnapost the time to stop social distancing measures. He said Britain was coming to the end of the first stage and would soon look to the second for how to live with the virus.  Once the NHS is sufficiently protected, case numbers fall, and PPE is secured, then that will be the time to move on to the second phase. Government insiders reportedly admitted last week they could ask the public to wear face masks when going out, to stop people spreading it further. Advisers to ministers showed evidence that masks could help stop some of the spread among people who donapost show any symptoms.And experts say there is not enough evidence to reopen schools yet because it is still unclear how coronavirus spreads among children.Schools and colleges have largely been closed under lockdown, except to children of essential workers and vulnerable youngsters, but it is thought they could be among the first places to reopen once restrictions start being eased.  But chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said that while a great majority of children either do not contract the virus or have mild symptoms, there is still not enough data on how youngsters contribute to the spread of Covid-. He said the lower the transmission rate of coronavirus - or R value - the greater room for manoeuvre there is for what lockdown measures could be lted. Speaking at the Downing Street briefing on Monday, Prof Whitty said: If you have schools open, it does contribute to increasing the R.  If you close schools, the R goes down, it was part of the collection of things that were done in March to try and pull the R from where it was, near three, to where it is now, below one. He added: If you stopped doing it, you would actually lose some of the benefit that we have currently got. But we do not yet have direct data that really help us in assessing the impact, he said.

Another weekend saw sunbathers once again moved on and quizzed by police across the country, but hundreds were allowed to queue at BQ stores. The DIY chain opened  branches across the UK over the weekend, which saw customers flock to their nearest outlet. But Ken Marsh, chair of the Met Police Federation, said the force need clearer guidance over what is and isnapost allowed during the lockdown. He told The Sun : “Why is it OK to queue with hundreds outside a BQ but not to sit on a blanket in a park well away from other people  “It makes no sense whatsoever to my colleagues and I doubt whether it makes any sense to the public. “We, the police, are the fall guys for not properly enforcing the lockdown on one hand, and on the other doing too much to enforce it depending on who you are listening to. The Government needs to get a grip and issue straight-forward advice.” Police were seen speaking to sunbathers in some of Londonaposs most popular parks over the weekend as temperatures soared to C in the capital.  Brits once again ignored lockdown measures over the weekend, including a couple who drove from Kent to Cornwall for a mini break. A police officer caught the couple flouting lockdown restrictions on a patrol – and they were found to be driving without insurance and a driving licence. The car was seized by Devon and Cornwall Police and the tourists were issued with two fixed penalty notices, reports  Cornwall Live. Police were given powers at the end of March to issue fines to those caught flouting stay-at-home rules.  And in Wales, a group of tourists travelled  miles to climb Snowdon. Ten people, in two separate cars, were stopped by police on the A in Bethesda, having driven from London. The officers who told the group tohome called the Roads Policing Unit who escorted them to the A. They were all reported for breaching the new Covid- legislation.Over the Easter weekend more than  people were fined – which includes one person who drove hundreds of miles to collect an  eBay  purchase. Others were fined for going on fishing trips or travelling to the region to get away from family. Devon and Cornwall Police have carried out a total of , visits to beauty spots and businesses across the two counties. Officers have spoken to more than , people during targeted patrols, with  people given verbal warnings after they failed to follow the guidance. It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson ed to Downing Street today following his battle with coronavirus. Speaking outside Number , Mr Johnson said the nation is starting to wrestle the invisible mugger that is Covid- to the floor - adding: We are beginning to turn the tide. But he shot down claims he would spell out an exit plan as early as this week - saying now is the time of maximum risk.

Dog Molly caught  balls and the CEO of Get Kids Going! volunteered to have  buckets of water thrown in her face. And just take a look at these amazing people using lockdown to achieve extreme feats. aposEverest in a monthapos challenge Jo Moseley is on day  out of  of her Everest in a month challenge on an aerobic step in her back yard – and is at ,ft. She wants to keep fundraising for her local foodbank after she reaches the ,ft goal and may even climb another mountain. Jo, , of Skipton, North Yorks, says: “Friends of friends came up with the idea. I began posting my efforts online and the response was great. “I get anxious easily and one way it shows up is my legs don’t want to move – so moving my legs is good to focus on breathing.” Jo is no stranger to a challenge – she was the first woman to paddle board coast to coast last year, all while picking up litter. She says: “When my mum died I rowed a million metres on an indoor rowing machine. “I never try to be the fittest, fastest or the strongest, I just do it because it lts my soul.” Kitchen ultra-marathon  Running across his kitchen, Sean Wilson isn’t rushing to boil the kettle. He’s just completed km – just over  miles – in his home. Sean, , says it’s just the boost he’s needed in these dficult times. The personal trainer from Colchester, Essex, says: “I was feeling sorry for myself. I had no work and was feeling a bit useless. “I researched charities and Age UK really resonated with me – as the older generation are probably most hit by what is going on. “Someone had done a marathon in their garden, so I wanted to do something more extreme. We have a small flat, which is . metres long and we worked out km would be , laps.” The former Marine started at am on a Friday and completed it on am on Saturday. But he admits: “I didn’t realise how hard it would be. With all the stopping and turning you can’t really get any speed up. “The pain in my knees, my feet and my back consumed my thoughts from km onwards. I was on the edge of not making it.” But he found motivation in his friends, family and girlfriend, Sophie, , and raised £,. Paddling pool marathon  Teenager Hannah Buzzard turned her love of swimming and the clever use of a ft paddling pool into fundraising for Blood Cancer UK. The -year-old completed a marathon in the water in just a week – raising more than £. Hannah, who lives in Gosport, Hants, with sister, Liberty, eight, and mum Marie, says: “I’m a competitive swimmer and I wanted to do something to make me swim so chose a marathon distance.” Hannah attached a bungee around her waist, which was tied to a fence – so she could swim without moving for  s a day. Hannah says: “I was swimming around  minutes a day. It was very, very cold. My mum works on the support line for Blood Cancer UK – I’m really proud I could help.” Wheelchair ultra-marathon  Brynn Hauxwell is covering , miles – theof the Shetland coastline – in a wheelchair on an exercise roller in his front room. Brynn,  today, has autism, ADHD, asthma and fixed ankle contractures – which means his foot is fixed at a  degree angle. He said: “I can’t put my foot fully flat down on the ground which means I can’t really walk long distances. “But I’m normally quite active in my wheelchair and enjoy archery and mono-skiing. I haven’t been able to do that at the moment, so this challenge has given me something to focus on and has taken my mind off the situation around the world.” Brynn is raising money for Ability Shetland, which provides support to disabled people all over Shetland. He says: “At the moment I’m doing five miles a day – which takes about six hours. “I’ve had great support from my family and a lot of support online. It makes me feel really good.” Tour de Lounge  Nick Spooner, , was diagnosed with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease when he was . The condition creates a weakness in nerves and muscles – meaning Nick often broke and sprained his ankles. It also meant he could no longer enjoy sport. Over the past couple of years he has had both of his legs operated on to aid his illness. Nick, from Sheffield, said: “Just as I was able to start moving again, the lockdown happened. “So I thought I would take this opportunity to use my indoor bike to raise funds for Hope Not Hate. I decided I wanted to cycle theof the Tour De France but had no idea how long it was.” Undeterred, he drew out a map for his ,-mile trek. He said: “It’s going well so far and I’m really enjoying it. “ Nick has so far cycled  miles and raised nearly £ –and is considering doing a challenge for real after lockdown.

But around  per cent of cancer diagnoses are preventable. Michele O’Connor has the vital statistics to help you cut your chances of developing the disease. Eat four Brazil nuts every day Brazil nuts are high in the mineral selenium, which many of us are ­deficient in. This powerful antioxidant has been associated with a reduced risk of bladder, prostate and skin cancer. In fact, an Australian study showed that those with the highest selenium levels had almost % fewer skin cancer tumours. Count your coffees  Five daily cups is associated with a % decreased risk of bowel cancer – compared to drinking none. Four cups a day may reduce the risk of developing mouth and pharynx cancers by % and two cups can reduce liver cancer risk by a third. Get outside Getting  to  minutes of sun exposure a day can help raise your vitamin D intake. Japanese researchers who examined , men and women aged -, found that higher levels of vitamin D were linked to a % lower risk of liver cancer, while overall cancer risk was % less. Breakfast on yogurtResearchers found that those who ate a daily serving of yogurt lowered their risk of lung cancer by % compared to those who didn’t. And a Hard Medical School study found that men who had two or more servings of yogurt per week lowered their risk of precancerous growths in their colons by %.  Swap white bread and rice for brown A review of  studies by Cancer Research UK found the risk of bowel cancer was reduced by % for every g of total dietary fibre and cereal fibre consumed each day. Furthermore, g of wholegrains daily accounted for a % reduction in risk . Buya dog It’s well proven that owning a dog has numerous health benefits but a recent study published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology showed that people who owned a dog or cat were almost % less likely to develop non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma – a type of cancer that affects the body’s cells. Experts believe that exposure to pets helps build up our immune systems. Eat three portions of fish per week  Those who enjoy fish on a regular basis have a % lower risk of bowel cancer than those who eat less than one portion per week, say experts from the University of Oxford and the ­International Agency for Research on Cancer who examined the dietary habits of , people. Add garlic Chinese scientists who looked at , lung cancer patients and , healthy adults found that participants who ate raw garlic at least twice a week were % less likely to develop lung cancer.

But it is thought they could be among the first places to reopen once restrictions start being eased. However chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said that while a great majority of children either do not contract the virus or have mild symptoms, there is still not enough data on how youngsters contribute to the spread of the deadly Covid-. It came as reports emerged today of unusual symptoms in children with coronavirus, that Health Secretary Matt Hancock today  said left him aposvery worried.aposA dozen children have been taken to intensive care with the symptoms which appear similar to toxic shock syndrome.Prof Whitty today explained how the lower the transmission rate of coronavirus - or R value - the greater room for manoeuvre there is for what lockdown measures could be lted. Speaking at the Downing Street briefing today, Prof Whitty said: If you have schools open, it does contribute to increasing the R. If you close schools, the R goes down, it was part of the collection of things that were done in March to try and pull the R from where it was, near three, to where it is now, below one. He added: If you stopped doing it, you would actually lose some of the benefit that we have currently got. But we do not yet have direct data that really help us in assessing the impact, he said. There is more accurate information on how children spread diseases such as flu, Prof Whitty said, but we are still really learning on how they spread Covid-.  He added: Whilst I think it remains the case that the contribution of children at school is probably less than, for example, flu, we do think it certainly contributes. What we are trying to work out is what proportion of the R it contributes and therefore,children went back to school, how much closer to one - and thataposs in a bad way - would we be and could it even tip us above one. He said scientic advisers would present a range of options to ministers about easing lockdown measures and dficult choices would have to be made. Prof Whitty added: There is no perfect solution where we are going to end up being able to do all the things that people want and, at the same time, keep R below one.  So, there are going to have to be some very dficult choices between dferent things, all of which ideally all of us would love to open up, but we canapost do them all. Therefore, there will have to be some dficult choices, and choices around schools clearly will be one of those.

We know a complete lting will not happen. Rather, a gradual “moving” towards a new status quo. But quite when that will begin to happen, what will move first, and for whom, is yet to be established. Here, we take a look at the possibilities and potential time scales for Britain’s very dferent normality. What will it mean for you  Schoolchildren Kids could be first in the queue for ‘normal’. Experts cite schools reopening as a first phase, which could happen this side of the summer holidays, or be delayed until September. Italy has opted for the latter, while in Denmark kids under  were allowed back earlier this month. Germany has drawn up guidance for reopening some schools from early May, with measures including spacing between desks and staggered break times. Dominic Raab has agreed social distancing measures would need to be in place. The Scottish government has suggested classrooms might be re-designed. Professor Keith Neal, an expert in Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases at the University of Nottingham, explains coronavirus doesn’t appear to affect children under  – so they might be first to .He also explains evidence has not actually revealed kids pose a spreading risk. He said: “Schools ing should be one of the first measures but it will be a staged response, and schools will need to look at their building size. Alternate weeks might be one option.” Over s First it was suggested elderly and high-risk groups should isolate for  weeks. Now reports have hinted they might have to stay at home until a vaccine is found – potentially up to  months. But already there are hints of a rebellion from those in the age category who are fit.  Lord David Blunkett has argued: “Older people must not be subjected to arbitrary incarceration as well as isolation.” And Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director at Age UK, added: “Simply being over a certain age, say , does not seem a good enough reason on its own to force millions to shut themselves away for considerably longer than everyone . “The Government should develop the next stage of its advice on the basis of the best science that exists and older people should make their own decisions about the risks they are prepared to take, bearing in mind their state of health.” However, Professor Neal says even those aged  without underlying conditions are at greater risk. He said: “Regardless of how fit you are, the ageing immune system is the problem. The mortality rate of -year-olds is around %, by the time you get to  it’s approaching %.” Construction Some building firms have started to reopen sites already, and others have planned for May, albeit with social distancing. Guidance from the Construction Leadership Council outlines where workers are required to work within two metres of each other, they should “work side by side, or facing away from each other, rather than face to face”.  When this is not possible, workers should “keep this to  minutes or less where possible”. Professor Neal says outdoor working with social distancing poses a very small risk. Factories Factories are also going back to work, with carmakers including Jaguar Land Rover, Aston Martin and Nissan announcing the gradual , with social distancing. In Germany, in one Volkswagen plant, production will be just -% to begin with, and nudge up. There, extra measures include workers taking their temperature before entering. Shop workers Dominic Raab has suggested social distancing queues and markers could be adopted in non-essential shops. Plastic screens at tills could also be introduced. Garden centres might be some of the first to re-open. Some are already offering click-and-collect services. John Lewis has also revealed a blueprint for potential re-opening, showing phases of– first including only stores with large car parks so staff and customers don’t need to rely on public transport.  A report by retail trade body the British Retail Consortium has stated guidelines including the closure of changing rooms in clothes shops, closure of toilets, restricting the numbers of shoppers according to shop size, and limiting or removing seating and promotional stands to make more room, as well as one-way systems and separate exits and entrances. Professor Neal stresses as this is mainly a respiratory virus, the risk of it transferring via fabric in clothes shops is low. And he added any outdoor business poses a minimal risk, alongside social distancing. Generally, he said shops should re-open soon. “At the moment, shop workers don’t seem to be falling ill in large numbers, because the situation is being managed,” he said. Hairdressers and beauticians These businesses could be last in the queue. “This is an up-close activity, it’s a problem,” says Professor Neal. “Social distancing is virtually impossible. If we can drive the disease to very low levels they could re-open.” Pub and restaurant workers There’s no doubt these are high-risk. A study in China revealed in January, a diner at a restaurant spread coronavirus to nine others, all sitting at their table. The British government is said to be closely observing the five-point plan of the Czech Republic, which states restaurants could serve customers outside by the end of May, and start to serve indoors by June. Sweden kept theirs open – but with no queuing at the bar, and table service only.  Professor Neal feels these venues will open late down the line, but some measures could help. “Distancing between customers is key. If you go with a family member that’s very dferent than going with a group. So you could have small tables, certain distances apart. You might also want to screen more at the bar, or go for table service,” he says. “And being outside is completely dferent. Beer gardens opening first might be a sensible option.” Office workers A packed office is certainly a long way off – and may never be seen again. If people need or want to go back, social distancing will be key, so part of the workforce will have to stay home to make space.  Communal kitchens and water coolers will be out. Professor Neal suggests it’s an unnecessary risk. “Work at homeyou can, why not ” he says. Pregnant women Pregnant woman were placed in a vulnerable group by the Chief Medical Officer in March, meaning they were advised to reduce social contact through social distancing measures. But The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Midwives has reassured women there is no evidence to suggest pregnant women generally are at greater risk from Covid-.

And officials have now made tests available to all those classied as key workers during the pandemic. What is the test and who can get it  The test to find outyou have coronavirus is known as the polymerase chain reactiontest. Public Health England’s “antigen test” was one of the first developed to locate Covid- genes in swab samples. It was developed after Chinese scientists in January released details of the new coronavirus’s full genetic code. Since testing of the general public was abandoned on March  the UK has had so little testing capacity that only hospitalised patients were given it. This was then extended to NHS staff - after an outcry due to so many being off work - and then to social care workers. Since Friday all ten million key workers have also been entitled to a test as well as anyone living with them. All jobs which qualy for ‘key worker’ status are listed on the Government’s website. They include police, firefighters, prison guards, refuse collectors, power station workers, council staff as well as workers in transport, education and the production or sale of essential goods. How can people get tested Key workers and their families who want a test can visit www.gov.uk enter their details.They should then receive a text or email the same day inviting them to book an appointment at a drive-through testing site, or notication they will receive a home testing kit. Test results from the drive-through sites should be sent out by text within  hours. Results of home test kits would be sent out within  hours of collection. However a limited number of test slots are available and home testing kits have run out after a few hours each morning. Slots at drive through centres have lasted a little longer each day. Why is all test capacity not being used up  The Government boasted of having test “capacity” well above than the number of tests that were actually being carried out. That was because carers were not getting access to home testing kits while drive-through test centres were often many miles away. The location of testing centres meant patients feeling very ill would have to drive for hours to provide their swab sample.  To use up this extra capacity access to testing has been opened up to all care workers while more testing sites are set up. The Government has said it is aiming to get to  testing sites and as of yesterday said  were up and running. Is the UK test reliable  Public Health Englandwas one of the first organisations outside of China to implement a diagnostic test. Recently a leaked PHE document warned some test results may be unreliable. The document from its National Infection Service advised technicians to be careful before “calling” a result negative to “retest ambiguous samples”.  PHE refuted claims as many as % tests were giving  negative results insisting it was as good as other tests being used where. Infection director Prof Sharon Peacock said: “No diagnostic test is % sensitive. The test is regularly and thoroughly reviewed to make sure it remains reliable and effective.” All tests can be gradually improved as more information comes to light about a new virus. Pharmaceutical firms are also developing tests and PHE plans to switch to a commercial test at some point in future. Why is the number of tests higher than the number of patients tested  Public Health England says that some people require more than one test for clinical reasons. This includes people having dferent samples taken, for instance a throat swab and a nasal swab. Some have an inconclusive first test or medics decide to double-check a negative result from someone who had previously been positive. What is contact tracing  This involves identying and alerting people who may have been exposed so that they can protect themselves and others around them. It could be used for someone has tested positive for coronavirus, or have reported symptoms to the NHS meaning they are likely to have Covid-. Clinicians would then gather information about places they have visited and people they have been in contact with. To help with contact tracing , people are being recruited who will help noty people who has come in to contact with a Covid- case.  An NHS app is currently being developed which could identy people who have been in proximity to a smartphone user who then developed coronavirus symptoms. Using Bluetooth Low Energy signals, the app will log each time it comes into close range of other devices also running the app. The app keeps an anonymous record of all these logs securely on a user’s phone. If someone develops symptoms of Covid-, they can use the app to inform the NHS, which will then trigger an anonymous alert to any other app users the infected person came into contact with by analysing the collected logs. The app will then advise what action to take, including telling people to self-isolatenecessary. A date for the app’s release has not been confirmed but the NHS said it will be “in the coming weeks”. The app isn’t compulsory, but those who don’t download it or don’t have a compatible phone will potentially miss out on knowing quicklythey might be infected. Can you get Covid- more than once  The World Health Organisation caused concern over the weekend when it warned that there is “no evidence” that people who had Covid- will be immune. It then retracted the warning to re-phrase it as it was seen to imply that people do not become immune to future infections. The truth is there is not enough reliable data at the moment to say either way as the new virus has not been around long enough. Howeverit behaves in a similar way to other forms of coronavirus virus then being infected is likely to see the body develop antibodies that see the patient become immune for months or even years. Prof James Naismith, of Oxford University, said: “It seems certain that almost all people who have been infected will have complete immunity against re-infection for at least a short time.  “We know that for many coronaviruses, immunity weakens in many people over a few years, and for this reason some viruses infect and re-infect people. “We do not, and cannot, know for sure how Covid- will behave. “So-called ‘immunity passports’ for previously infected people are political inventions built around complex scientic concepts. “Only a safe and effective vaccine, that I believe will come in the future, will deliver widespread immunity from infection.” What is the antibody test  The antibody test measures the levels of these antibodies in someone which would suggest whether someone has previously had Covid- and is now immune. If the tests are accurate enough, they could potentially identy iniduals who are at least in part protected against the virus.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said a successful test would be a “game changer” as it could identy people able to safely go back to work.The home test versions of the test - similar to a pregnancy test - still have poor accuracy rates so are too unreliable to be offered to the general public. It needs to achieve a high degree of accuracy to prevent carers from ly believing they are immune. A more reliable test, which needs to be sent off and analysed in a lab, is being trialled on a sample of the population.  This should give an idea of what proportion of the UK have had Covid-. However the test is not accurate enough for the results to be relied on by the iniduals taking part. The government has reportedly placed a provisional order for up to  million new antibody test kits. They are being developed by the newly formed Rapid Testing Consortium at Oxford University. Why is testing important  Widespread testing is key to lting some lockdown measures and ing some degree of normality to Britain before a vaccine is developed. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that once testing capacity is high enough it could be used as part of a nationwide track and trace operation. This would only be enacted when infection rates are very low and would rely on a mass public participation.  Some social measures could be lted while mass testing monitored infection rates. If infection rates started to surge then lockdown measures could be reintroduced. How would a vaccine work  The great hope for ato normal le is a vaccine. The first human trial of one in Europe began at Oxford University last week with two volunteers. One was injected with a potential vaccine and the other with a control product. Scientists developing a second potential vaccine at imperial College London will start recruiting volunteers for clinical trials to begin in June. The Oxford vaccine will try to stimulate the immune system using a common cold virus taken from chimps The researchers at Imperial are using droplets of liquid to carry the genetic material they need to get into the bloodstream.

Doctorsapos hopes that she could make it to the  weeks pregnant mark were scuppered when her lung suddenly collapsed, meaning she had to give birth the next day. Experts from the UC College of Medicine were called in to advise on what to do next. They suggested performing a extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, a aposnear last resortapos procedure which involves temporarily replacing the lungs and heart of a patient. UC Health had never before performed the process on a pregnant woman, but decided Megan was a good candidate.  She was flown to Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton attached to a ventilator, before surgeons delivered her son via cesarean section at  weeks and six days. The baby was taken to a nenonatal intensive care unit, leaving Megan to recover. When she woke she had no recollection of having given birth to her second child.

But as doctors have learned more about the deadly bug, which has claimed the lives of more than , people in the UK, they have updated their list of symptoms. The CDC in America now reports the symptoms which could appear between two to  days of exposure to the virus as:Chills Repeated shaking with chills Muscle pain Headache Sore throat New loss of taste or smell In an  Iranian study, % of Covid- patients who reported a loss of smell said it had a sudden onset. In many of the cases, anosmia, as it’s called, appeared before other symptoms.Vallery Lomas, a -year-old champion baker, told the Washington Post: “It scared the hell out of me. “I could smell nothing for probably five days.” Professor Claire Hopkins, president of the British Rhinological Society and a leading ear, nose and throat consultant surgeon, is leading the charge to get loss of sense of smell recognised by the World Health Organization and Public Health England as a coronavirus symptom.  Prof. Hopkins said: One in six patients will lose their sense of smell as an isolated symptom, really without getting any other associated symptoms. One in four will get it along with other symptoms, but right at the beginning of infection. It is a good early marker of infection. She added: When you look at all the dferent symptoms, loss of sense of smell is actually one of the best predictors of Covid- infection. Much better than fever, and more prevalent and a stronger predictor than cough. In France, researchers are preparing to launch a human trial to test their hypothesis that nicotine can help the body combat the Covid- infection.  The trial will involve groups of healthcare workers and patients wearing nicotine patches and other groups wearing placebo patches. Then they will be tested to seethere is a dference in how their bodies respond to the virus. The trial is a follow-up to a French study, published this month, of public health data which appeared to show that people who smoke are % less likely to catch Covid- than non-smokers of the same age and sex. The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cougha feverIf you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS  unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains. Sneezing is not a symptom of the coronavirus."},{"url":null,"title":"students use find friends app","story":"NewsStudents use Find My Friends App to discover murdered pals body in lovers bedFriends of New York student Haley Anderson, , found her dead in her lovers bed after they traced her phone to Orlando Terceros house and climbed into the propertyShareCommentsByMatthew Dresch:,  APR NewsHaley Anderson, , was killed by Orlando Tercero in  \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

It is hoped aggressive screening and testing strategies will help slow the spread of Covid-. But the World Health Organizationhas warned there could be  million cases on the continent within three to six months. Last week, Executive director of the WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, Dr Mike Ryan, warned: We are at the beginning in Africa. Researchers say those suffering from HIV or any other existing health condition or malnutrition will be hit worse by the virus.Only two out of  countries in Africa have so far not reported any coronavirus cases - Lesotho, in southern Africa, and Comoros.South Africa has the most cases of any country on the continent with , and  deaths, followed by Egypt with , confirmed cases and  deaths. Algeria has recorded the most number of deaths in Africa with  fatalities and , deaths. In one high-profile case, Nigerian officials announced that the presidentaposs chief of staff has died. The government said Abba Kyari, chief of staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, died earlier this month after falling with coronavirus.

UNECA outlined the troubling conditions that it says will put people in some parts of Africa at grave risk. Its report warns % of the urban population is concentrated in overcrowded and poorly serviced slum dwellings, excluding North Africa. Only % of the households have access to basic hand washing facilities. A total  % of Africa’s workforce is informally employed. UNECA warns most of that workforce cannot work from home, limiting ability to impose the kinds of social distancing restrictions being deployed by countries like the UK. The report emphasises that close to % of children under five years of age in Africa are already undernourished.  And of all the worldaposs continents Africa has the highest prevalence of certain underlying conditions, like tuberculosis and HIV AIDS. Many African countries also have lower ratios of hospital beds and health professionals to serve their populations than other regions. They are also highly dependent on on imports for its medicinal and pharmaceutical products, and suffer from weak economies. Unable to sustain health and lockdown costs, the continent is vulnerable, the report warns. UNECA has modelled four scenarios based on the level of preventive measures introduced by African governments.

Reports emerged over the weekend claiming the dictator had died, or been left in a vegetative state following a botched heart surgery. The surgeon was said to have made a mistake because his hands were shaking so much. But just as quickly as the rumours started, North Korean media sought to stop them and has reported the hermit stateaposs leader has spoken over the weekend. It has been reported that Kim had thanked workers on the project in the city of Wonsan, where a train believed to be his has been spotted in satellite images amid unveried reports that he is either dead, in a vegetative state or alive and well. Kimaposs whereabouts and the status of his health remain a mystery as he has not been seen in state media reports since April , the day before he reportedly had the operation. It is just the latest in a long line of bizarre stories surrounding the controversial leader - from feeding his uncle to dogs to executing a general in a James Bond-inspired killing. Kim Jong-unaposs weight has ballooned in recent years to a massive -stone, said to be fuelled by his obsession with Swiss cheese. And his waistline isnapost the only thing thataposs suffered. The leader is said to be suffering from the painful condition, gout, because of his love of the fatty food. As far back as , he was spotted limping at the anniversary of his grandfatheraposs death. North Korea expert Michael Madden thinks the tyrantaposs weight gain - his father died of a heart attack - and genetics point towards gout. He said: Based on his gait, it appears he has gout - something due to diet and genetic predisposition that has affected other members of the Kim family. Kimaposs love of cheese is said to stem from when he was a student in Switzerland. He was special shipments delivered and has also sent envoys to France to try to enrol North Korean cooks on cheese-making courses. In , Kim reportedly had to briefly retreat from public le after eating too much Emmental cheese, after a large shipment of it arrived from Switzerland. He might not look the type but Kim Jong-un appears to be a massive fan of music and even formed his own girlband. Moranbong is one of the most famous bands in North Korea and were founded by the leader himself. The band, known for their military unorm-style costumes, extravagant shows and synthesizer-backed anthems, were among the country’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in . A year later, the girls were all put on a regimented diet to standardise their waistlines, according to North Korea watchers Sino-NK. And not surprisingly, most of the girl band’s songs appear to be about the North Korean leader himself. “How can he be so kind,” the lyrics to one ballad go. “His smile is so warm and sweet. I have no choice but to be taken by him and his warm heart.” And managing the style of his girlband isnapost the only thing Kim is keen on controlling - he wants to influence the hair of everyone in the country. In  North Korean authorities issued an order requiring men to keep their hair no longer than cm, while woman were required to keep their hair bobbed. Young men have been told to model their hairstyle on the supreme leader’s own eccentric style, where the sides and back of the head are almost clean shaven and only the top is left. Young men are supposed to wear their hair in a bobbed cut like Kim’s we Ri Sol-ju. Only performers are now allowed to grow their hair, according to reports. A Pyongyang source said that the order was being enforced in the country’s universities, where “university student monitors are walking around with scissors and cutting off the hair of offenders.” Kim himself, however, is believed to be scared of barbers, so he cuts his own hair. And the supreme leader has a very famous best friend - basketball superstar and former Chicago Bulls player, Dennis Rodman. Kim has been a basketball fan since he was a teenager and would spend hours drawing his favourite player, Michael Jordan. His dreams to meet one of his heroes finally came true in  when Rodman visited North Korea. At the time Rodman said: My mission is to break the ice between hostile countries. Why it’s been left to me to smooth things over, I don’t know. Dennis Rodman, of all people. Keeping us safe is really not my job it’s the black guy’s [Obama’s] job.

The leader of the hermit state is now said to have issued a statement proving he is alive and well - although no images have been seen on Kim since the claims emerged over the weekend. He was believed to have undergone heart surgery on April  and since then it has been alleged that he has died or been left in a vegetative state following the botched operation. But yesterday State media reported that Kim had thanked workers on the project in the city of Wonsan, where a train believed to be his has been spotted in satellite images amid unveried reports that he is either dead, in a vegetative state or alive and well. Kimaposs whereabouts and the status of his health remain a mystery as he has not been seen in state media reports since April , the day before he reportedly had the operation. The only thing that is certain is no-one knows for sure what is happening inside North Korea. Any claims about Kim or the countryaposs activities are almost impossible to very given Pyongyangaposs secrecy and isolation from the rest of the world. However, ever since Kim took control following his fatheraposs death in , disturbing reports have filtered out of North Korea about his brutal regime. Millions live in poverty while the leader and his family reside in lavish luxury. Kim keeps his power absolute with fear - and is said to have carried out brutal executions and assassinations of anyone who opposes him, including members of his own family. Jang Song-thaek was the -year-old dictatoraposs uncle and close to the seat of power - but in  he was executed as a traitor for all ages. It was claimed he had tried to seize power from his nephew. Jang seemed to have reached the pinacle of his his career in January , but that same month was excluded from high level meetings. When another was chosen in his place to attend a special meeting in China, it seemed there was no way back for the man who had been one of Kimaposs most trusted advisors. Eventually, it was a row over who had control of North Koreasapos fisheries - the military or Kim - that would lead to Jangaposs death. First, his senior aides were executed then on December , Jang himself was kicked out of the Workersapos Party of North Korea. Jang was accused of having committed anti-party, counter-revolutionary factional acts that included illicit affairs with women, harboring politically-motivated ambition, weakening the partyaposs guidance over judicial, prosecution and peopleaposs security bodies and obstructing the nationaposs economic affairs. He was executed on December  in what is rumoured to be the most gruesome way possible - it is claimed Jang was stripped naked and locked in a cage with  starving dogs. The reports first emerged in Chinese media and have never been confirmed. But this is far from the only gruesome execution said to have been carried out on the orders of Kim Jong-un. One general fell foul of the dictatoraposs temper when he was accused of planning a coup. Furious, and inspired by a James Bond villain, Kim ordered a truly chilling execution - he was thrown into aposa piranha-filled fish tankapos. It is reported that the giant fish tank was built inside Kimaposs Ryongsong Residence. The victim had his arms and torso cut open with knives before he was thrown into the tank, it is alleged. Sources claim that it was unclear whether the general was killed by the fish, died from his wounds or drowned. The North Korean leader was said to have taken the inspiration from the  James Bond movie aposThe Spy Who Loved Meapos, stated the report. Kimaposs blood thirsty executions started almost as soon as he took power from his father, Kim Jong-il. Vice Minister of the North Korean Army, Kim Chol, was purged back in  for drinking and carousing during a period of mourning for his former leader. But this was no ordinary execution by firing squad. Chol was rumoured to have been exploded by mortar bombardment. Vice Marshall Ri Yong-ho was another of Kimaposs inner circle to lose his le in . Despite leading Kim Jong-ilaposs funeral procession at the side of his son, he was said to have been executed the following July. Ri Ryong-has was one of Kimaposs uncleaposs aides and the leader was said to have been very drunk when he ordered both his and jang Su-gil in  by firing squad. Choe Yong-gon was North Koreaaposs Vice Premier when he suddenly disappeared from public le in , and is believed to have been executed. Even being the brother of the despotic leader doesnapost keep the ruling family safe. Kim Jong-unaposs half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, was reportedly assassinated after being found dead in an airport. He had been seen as the heir apparent to his father Kim Jong-il, however he fell out of favour a few years before the dictatoraposs death. Instead, his brother Kim Jong-un took control of the country and was allegedly behind the death of his half-brother at a Malaysian airport in . One of the women accused of murdering Kim Jong-nam at Kuala Lumpuraposs international airport was released from prison earlier this year.

The black-and-white footage shows him pumping the liquid into his hand. He then raises his hand to his mouth, apparently drinking the sanitiser, before walking away while looking around for cameras, although he seems to miss the one above his head. A few seconds later he s and appears to steal the entire bottle. The deputy mayor of the Romanian city of Suceava thinks the man was inspired by the Presidentaposs words. Deputy mayor Lucian Kharshovski said the footage was captured by CCTV camera in one of the apartment buildings run by the city council. Mr Kharshovski, who shared the video online, said: I wonderthis guy has listened to Trumpaposs advice on disinfectant  If you recognise the character, please tag him in the post to seeheaposs okay and healthy.

John-Paul Drike, the director of Drakes Supermarkets in Adelaide, Australia, says he responded simply by giving the alleged hoarder the middle finger. In a stunning YouTube video, the supermarket boss has vented his anger at those who have taken advantage of the desperate rush for basic household supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. He claimed that one unidentied customer had been audacious enough to purchase  -roll packets of loo roll and  units of one-litre sanitiser from his shop - and then later ask for a refund. Follow the latest coronavirus updates here “I had my first customer yesterday who said he wanted to get a refund on  packets of -pack toilet paper and  units of one-litre sanitiser, Mr Drake says in his video on April . Flipping his middle finger at the screen, he added: “I told him that.  Branding those who have been panic-buying supplies such as toilet paper absolutely ridiculous, he continued: That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country. Speaking to News, he said the man wanted to get rid of the items because he was no longer able to sell them on eBay after his site was shut down. He claimed that he had as many as  people working with him to buy up the highly-sought after commodities. Australiaaposs Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton, has said that the government will come down like a ton of bricks on supermarket hoarders who have been clearing shelves of basic supplies. Speaking last month, he said that that anyone caught profiteering from buying up essential groceries such as food and toilet paper will be prosecuted.

We felt very hard done by.“The boys who were kept on were feeling really fortunate because they were still getting paid.“I don’t knowit was the plan from the bosses to pick a team that could compete but we ended up with a really good team with some good youngsters left behind.“There was real quality and we said ‘let’s have a go’.”Despite being left with a threadbare squad, former club skipper Smith had some real talent to choose from that season with a good mix of youth and experience.The older heads included former Scotland internationals Rab Douglas and Neil McCann as well as experienced campaigners like Rhys Weston and Matt Lockwood while the younger ones included future Scotland star Leigh Grfiths, Dens hero Gary Harkins and defender Craig Forsyth among others.Called up from the youth team was also striker McIntosh, who hit a purple patch of goals at a critical point in the season – an equaliser against Stirling Albion followed by a double at Morton # before the Dark Blues went north to Dingwall.The match that clinched their unlikely survival turned out to be his final one of the season, however.McIntosh said: “When the match started I actually felt my hamstring go because of the demand of all the games before Ross County.“I think I actually tore the muscle and it was only about  minutes in. I knew the gaffer could tell something was wrong but, being young and naïve, I played through it.“It got worse and worse but it got to the point where I forgot all about it and then got the goal after half-time.“I was always motivated to chase down long balls and this time the goalkeeper took his time.“I nicked it from him and I don’t think I even considered anything about what to do next, it was natural. It was a great feeling despite the pain in my hamstring.“It was a really nice day up there I remember and the supporters were there in their numbers, it was an electric atmosphere.“I scored right in front of them and it was like an explosion.“There won’t be any other games with that kind of circumstance I don’t think, it was unique.“I remember the celebrations on the pitch – it was like we’d won the league. Everyone was ecstatic and it was just pure relief.“I don’t think I realised at the time how signicant it was. My focus was only on playing well and trying to make it as a first-team player.“It was a massive game looking back.“I still get Dundee fans coming up to me in the street to say they were there.”On the game itself, McIntosh’s then team-mate Irvine admits it was all a bit of a blur looking back.He added: “I remember Leighton’s goal, he was one of the really good young boys who did just as much as the older experienced lads.“It was the only goal of the game and, at the end, it felt like we had won the league. The feeling and the celebrations afterwards for what we achieved were amazing.“I’ve always said nothing comes close to that season. I’ve won three league titles and won Challenge Cups where you get a medal at the end for your hard work – there was no medal at the end of that one but I still class saving Dundee and keeping them in the league as my best achievement.”Irvine went on to spend six years at Dens Park as a player before ing as a coach where he took the U  side before the coronavirus shutdown.McIntosh, meanwhile, has had spells at Montrose, Peterhead, Icelandic side UMF Selfoss, Arbroath and Airdrie before signing for National League side Wrexham.Following the departure of manager Bryan Hughes, the now--year-old joined Lee Clark’s Blyth Spartans on loan until the pandemic hit.Despite his contract in Wales running down this summer, McIntosh is sanguine about his future.He added: “I took the opportunity to go down south and I’ve enjoyed it. It’s very competitive and the full-time setup was a big plus for me, too.“Everything is up in the air right now and I’ll have to wait and see what pre-season brings, whenever it starts.“I am out of contract this summer but I understand the furlough scheme will cover out-of-contract players for a time so I’m not overly concerned.“It is what it is, everyone is in the same boat.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

I wasn’t there at the time but nobody really remembers the Roma European Cup semi-final too fondly but they’ll always recall Barcelona and Monchengladbach.“Getting into the final was a massive thing for the city and the club but at the time, as players, nothing was really a surprise for us.“We were expecting to get there so when we did it was great to do, don’t get me wrong, but it wasn’t as much of a surprise to us as it was outsiders.“At that time there was the European Cup, Cup Winners’ Cup and the other teams went into the Uefa Cup.“When you think about that in recent terms, Liverpool didn’t win the league last season but they won the Champions League.“That was the sort of level we were up against. It was a huge achievement.”Bowman recalls United going into the second leg riled up after witnessing some premature celebrations from the Monchengladbach players after a stalemate in Dundee.The -year-old also remembers a rare occasion where legendary boss Jim McLean inidually congratulated his players after the final whistle.Bowman, who made  appearances in tangerine, added: “Under wee Jim we were always taught, unless it was the second leg and you had to win at home, as long as you didn’t lose a goal it was OK.“That was the biggest thing, from our point of view, we didn’t get beat and we weren’t up against it.“I remember they were celebrating after the first leg and that probably gave us a bit of impetus to go on and beat them.“They were high-fiving each other because they got a - and thought the tie was over so that annoyed us a bit.“It made such a dference for us going there at - and Iain getting the goal just before half time.“They had to really come at us because they needed to score two.“Going into half time it was a massive advantage but I can’t really remember us being under that much pressure.“We knew they had to score two which was a tough ask against our defence. It was quite comfortable.“They didn’t have a lot of chances. Big Thommohad some great games and made some big saves that season but I can’t really remember him having to be brilliant.“Heggiesaid to me after it, ‘You should take this all in,’ and I was probably very naïve and just thought this happens every year, we’ll do it again next year.“I probably didn’t appreciate it as much as what I probably should have. It’s only when you look back.“It’s probably one of the only times I can recall Jim coming round and shaking everybody’s hand in the dressing-room after the game.“He really pushed us to our limits and got the best out of everybody. If he could see you had something he would get it out of you, how he did it was irrelevant.“He was very guarded towards us but he went round and congratulated everyone inidually.”United went on to lose the final - over two legs against IFK Gothenburg, with a - Scottish Cup Final defeat to St Mirren sandwiched in between.Bowman believes had they beaten the Buddies they might’ve gone on to secure the Uefa Cup, too.He continued: “It shows how much the SFA helped us at the time! We played the Scottish Cup Final on the Saturday and the second leg of the Uefa Cup Final on the Wednesday.“It was for the good of Scottish football we were trying to win it as well. I thinkwe’d beaten St Mirren, we would’ve had a lot better chance.“There’s no way of saying we’d have definitely beat Gothenburg because they were a decent team but the St Mirren loss was the first down we’d had that season.“Everything was on the up all the time, even with the amount of games we’d played that year.“It was the first time the press had questioned our fitness because we’d played that many games.“You’re never tired when you’re winning but as soon as you get beat that can quickly change.“Personally, all the finals don’t mean anythingyou don’t win. You want to have success by winning and savouring that.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

Even social distancing could go.#Professor Hugh PenningtonThe UK Government is aiming to carry out , tests a day by the end of this month, but Prof Pennington believes the target should be nearer one million.The expert urged ministers to pursue such a strategy rather than pinning their hopes on getting a vaccine, as he warned: #We might never get a good vaccine#.Prof Pennington said schools, shops and restaurants could be the first to reopen, but he predicted pubs may have to remain shut for a longer period, as would restrictions on people coming into the country.#If we have an eradication strategy that is successful by the end of the year, then all these things could be abandoned. Even social distancing could go,# Prof Pennington said.#As long as we still had a really good testing programme to make sure the virus wasn#t still creeping about, and then we would obviously need to have restrictions on people coming into the country from countries where the virus is still busy.#Prof Pennington, who led a  government inquiry into an E. coli outbreak in Scotland, is due to give evidence to Holyrood#s health committee on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Tuesday.Professor Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, who has been a key adviser to the UK Government on its response to the disease outbreak, has warned that signicant social distancing measures would need to remain in place until a vaccine is created, which is not expected until next year.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has also said that #some form of social distancing is going to be required perhaps up to the point where a vaccine is available”.But Prof Pennington said government policy should not be based on such hopes.#I think it would be unwise to put all the weight on saying #we#re not going to be able to do this until we get a vaccine#,# he said.#Because, on the one hand, we might never get a good vaccine, because the virus itself might not be knocked back by a vaccine as well as we would like, and the vaccine themselves, there#s a theoretical possibility that some types of vaccine might make the illness worse. We#ve seen that in the past.#I think saying, #we can#t relax this until we#ve got a vaccine# would be a mistake, because that might mean predicating a policy on something that isn#t going to happen.#A vaccine would be nice, it would be greatit worked and it would solve a problem next year, but not this year.#I think the aim has to be to get the virus sorted out this year. The end of the year would be my optimistic target.#I think the aim has to be to get the virus sorted out this year.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

In order to help sustain all aspects of our community, wersquove tried to take a broad approach.One solution was the creation of the first Newstead Village Newsletter ndash a simple, four-page leaflet which included useful information and several helpline numbers. ldquoMelrose shops offering home deliveries were also included in the newsletter, says Lisa. ldquoWe put the information online but that excluded those without internet access. So, a printed version delivered to every home was essential.Local Volvo dealer John Cleland kindly offered to take care of the printing, while Gala Le said they would deliver.

The burst of le and colour with the longevenings resurrects my mood, enlivens my nature-loving soul. It makes our days feel longer while also giving us the extra energy to enjoy them.How can we not be uplted by the sight of a tree in full blossom bathed in sparkling sunshine, or a carpet of wild flowers especially after months of winter when the land sleeps, and the sun seems to have forgotten us But these are not normal times of course and the ability to roam in nature and soak in its wonder has been temporarily restricted. In fact for many of us our normal le routine has been totally suspended.While we are in lockdown, nature is enjoying the opposite itrsquos flourishing with new le and beauty. And while itrsquos frustrating that we cannot venture out in ways we might be used to, I have been able to listen more closely to the stories that nature is telling on my doorstep.Over the last few years I have deliberately lsquore-wildedrsquo my small garden which I am so lucky to have. By that I mean I have allowed nature to do its thing, and nature has accepted the invitation. Elder, rowan, silver birch and cherry trees now enclose my wee patch of the world. Wild flowers such as dandelion and forget-me-nots have sprung up and last year I had foxglove, so Irsquom waiting to see what this summer will bring.A strange effect of all this has been the enlarging of my garden. Not literally, but in the power of its presence. Irsquove noticed how a space full of nature feels bigger than one thatrsquos bare, lsquoneatrsquo and manicured.I like to call it the forest horizon effect. Compare standing in the middle of a wide open treeless park with standing in the middle of a wood surrounded by trees and humming le. The area of the wood may be much smaller than the park, but its impact on our senses is much greater. We are embraced by nature, not just physically but also,we feel the connection, emotionally and spiritually. The space actually feels larger than it is because there is more in it.I am missing this embrace so much right now because of the inability to visit my favourite woods. But the lockdown has compelled me to spend more time in the natural world on my back doorstep.And within the embrace of my gardenrsquos re-wilded forest horizon, although only a space of around  metres by , I have discovered the truth contained in the wonderful book by Scott Sampson How to Raise a Wild Child.In his book, Scott states: ldquoWhen I began on this book, I had a certain sense of self-satisfaction, convinced that a letime of outdoor play, hiking and campinghellip had forged within me a deep bond with naturehellip Instead, I found that, like most of us, I was oblivious to most of the natural goings-on around me.He explains how he then spent time with his daughter absorbing the sounds and sights of nature on his doorstep, which fostered their lsquointernal wildnessrsquo more than any trip to a remote wilderness. They listened to birdsong and sat quietly as small creatures played out their lersquos dramas under the shadow of their house. ldquoWildness just outside the front door, Scott writes, ldquowas helping us deepen our bond with nature. Such interactions, I have come to realise, are essential to nature connection.Reading this has given new meaning to the confinement imposed by the lockdown. Never before have I had such time to simply sit and absorb the tiny goings on in the garden, embraced by my own mini forest horizon.A garden is a privilege, of course, and I understand many donrsquot have one. But wildness can also be found on our walk to the shops, on verges and public green spaces, with trees, bushes and wild flowers that grow in our urban spaces. The trick is to pause and absorb the wonder of it, listen and look for the wee miracles that we usually donrsquot notice and walk by. Itrsquos easier now, even on a normally busy street, with so much reduced traffic noise and absence of bustle.On my exercise walk yesterday I did just this and was overwhelmed by the beauty of renewed le. It occurred to me that this precious one-walk-a-day has intensied the connection it gives me to local nature.And never have I enjoyed the privilege of having a re-wilded garden so much. On Easter Monday I sat in it with my five-year-old son. His attention span can be short but I explained what we were doing and he stayed with me for  minutes. The first thing I noticed was the absence of normal background noise, which heightened the volume of naturersquos spring melody.Our garden attracts many birds which sit on the branches and sing their hearts out. I know they donrsquot sing for us, but my young son thought they were doing just that. In just  minutes we heard or saw coal tits, wrens, wood pigeons, willow warblers, magpies and a robin. Irsquod never have previously known what some of these birds were, but now we are in a mindset to get to know who is inhabiting our lsquodoorstep wildnessrsquo.We also watched a peacock butterfly explore our garden as it fluttered and paused in equal measure. The sound of bumblebees arrived and we saw them hover over the dandelions. Then a small honey bee made an entrance, likewise visiting the dandelions. As we sat quietly, the sound of honking above us raised our heads and we saw two V formations of geese heading north.When my boy got restless, I suggested we crawl like explorers in the grass to see what we could find. We spotted an incredible sight: young garden spiders emerging from their egg sack which was half hidden under a curve in a plant pot. My sonrsquos fascination at this was matched by my own! It was early for this to happen, and we found many other egg sacks where still unhatched.Within these  minutes there was so much le and wonder so many stories to discover. Where did the small birds come from, where were the geese going, why do bees suddenly appear and what did they do during the winter  Why are dandelions so popular with the bees, what is so special about them  Why do the birds sing dferently, are they speaking to each otherso, what are they saying How did the peacock butterfly get its name and where did it hibernate, was it in our garden shed  What was it looking for  Were the hatching spiders emerging early because their mother deliberately chose a warm corner in the garden to lay her eggs  Why do some spiders live in the garden, while others like hiding under your bed  Do you know how to spot the dference, and do they spin their webs dferently These were just some of the stories my son and I wondered about after our  minutes together in our garden wilderness. But such drama happens all around us. Little patches of mini wilderness are everywhere,we hone our senses to notice and appreciate them.I realise now the lockdown, although stressful, has created the conditions for the discovery of so many new things, with so many new nature stories to learn tales of survival and adventure, of lersquos drama happening on our doorstep and in our street.And the biggest story of all is that everything around us is ultimately related. We are part of naturersquos story because we are part of nature. We share a common ancestor with every creature and plant yes, even with the trees.So while I, like us all, yearn for the end of the lockdown for many reasons, I am also going to try to make the best of it by being more aware of naturersquos wonders that are literally outside my window, while I stay at home to help keep others safe."},{"url":null,"title":"north-berwick-hotel-keeping-doors-open-key-workers","story":"The Nether Abbey Hotel shut its doors to the public last month for the first time since , and all its staff are observing the stay-at-home advice.The hotel is, however, continuing to provide a place to stay for those who are still working and need to undertake essential travel.Its owners, Jela and Stirling Stewart, wanted to follow all Government instructions, including First Minister Nicola Sturgeonrsquos request that hotels remain open to support those providing vital services.The couple said: ldquoAt first we were not sure who would need accommodation or who would be travelling.ldquoHowever, it soon became apparent that we needed to continue to provide this service, and companies are really grateful that we are open to them, albeit in a very altered state with extremely limited facilities.ldquoSo far we have had engineers who are carrying out vital works at Torness and a representative of a company who needed to travel from the south of England to repair vital agricultural equipment.ldquoWe have also had NHS staff who are working nights and then going home to try and sleep in a household with young children and just want somewhere quiet to sleep during the day ndash we are offering this service to all key NHS workers and emergency services free of charge.ldquoGuests are restricted to their rooms to protect us and the remaining couple of volunteers, and all public areas are closed off.ldquoLuckily there are still a few takeaways open, which means they can get an evening meal and we provide a breakfast for them to take to work.ldquoWe are observing a strict rota of rooms that are used and these are not entered for  hours after someone has departed to ensure we minimise all risk.

into it.I found a little information about it.It was located in Dam Brae and was said to contain water with special qualities that helped make a perfect pot of tea.There is little explanation as to what exactly these qualities were, but it seems to have been widely believed and accepted in the past.Tea, of course, became popular in Scotland, and by the th century it had become an important accompaniment to the often mundane diet of working class people, providing a refreshing non-alcoholic alternative to beer.For the poor, tea drinking wasnrsquot linked to formal social rituals as it was with the upper classes.Tea was the drink of the working class as they worked.So, a well in the heart of the town which was believed to supply good tea making water will have been a busy and popular place.Many people, likely mostly women, would have congregated around the well.In the OS name book from the s, it was clearly recorded that the well was listed as the ldquoVickerrsquos Well, but then goes on to state that ldquono person in the locality knows it by that name.Everyone called it ldquothe bickers well.Perhaps this was a result of local dialect changing the name over time.But Paul Bennet, in his interesting website ldquoThe Northern Antiquarian says ldquothere is the obvious possibility that the ldquobickers ndash as in chit-chat and gossip ndash related to it being where local folk simply met and chatted.Perhaps the reputation of the wellrsquos water for making quality tea also meant people from further afield considered it worthwhile to detour here, in order to make that extra special ldquoBickerrsquos Brew.One account says it was once surrounded by old trees.All of this conjures an image of an important social meeting place, with people meeting under the shade of old trees, exchanging views and information and having a good blether while they wait their turn to draw water from the celebrated well.Was the belief in the goodness of the water rooted in some older tradition Perhaps it was a revered holy well, as some have suggested It seems to have been associated with the vicarage of St Michaels nearby, which roots the well in Musselburghrsquos ancient past, and gives a reason for the name Vicarrsquos Well.The well was replaced by a pump sometime in the nineteenth century, and then was blocked up, and became forgotten.When Irsquod discovered all this I set out to find the location of the well to seethere was still any evidence of it.Dam Brae is now named Kilwinning Place and I studied a nineteenth century map which marked the exact location of the well, then compared it to a modern one and set out on my quest.I found the location. Irsquom sure of it, and took a photo.But there wasnrsquot really anything of much interest to see other than a slab on the ground where I believe the well once stood.It seemed so forgotten, and put me in a melancholy mood for a moment.I reflected on the way something that had been a tradition for so long, and such a part of many peoplersquos lives can just vanish, and be utterly forgotten.I know it was just a well and so might not seem important.But it was a meeting place for ordinary people for generations.The simple shared routines and places in our lives are often the ones we remember with nostalgia.We donrsquot think of them as history or worthy of recording until all memory has gone, and itrsquos too late.I thought about this as we were going on our local family walk this week.I suppose we all know we are living through a time that will be recorded by history.But when all this is over, and things are back to ldquonormal what simple things will you, and your family, remember from this time and what will you want remembered For me, this includes seeing the Greenhills carpeted with wildflowers for the first time that I can remember, watching children cycle on empty streets and deserted car parks, and queuing in shops, keeping our physical distance while also trying to stay social.For sure the toilet roll panic will be part of history.But all of us will have special moments and places that connect to the emotions of this time.There will be stories of peoplersquos wonderful community spirit, what it felt like to be confined in the house for weeks, and how we entertained ourselves.We are all historians of our own time, and we should find ways to record and remember the simple, but important, things we have felt and encountered during this time of crisis.Because memory fades, and as the fate of the Bickers Well shows,memories are not recorded or stories of them not told, they will be forgotten.And so this was why I decided to re-visit the story of the Bickers Well for my column this week.It may have originally seemed there was not much to tell about it.Yet once there was.But the memories and the stories connected to it seemed so simple and obvious at the time that nobody really thought them important enough to record or keep treasured.Now all that remains of those stories is a slab on the pavement.The technology we have makes it easier now to share and record our lives.So letrsquos use it to consciously be historians and storytellers of this dficult time to capture images and feelings, the happenings that may today seem too simple and commonplace to record, but in future will be a fascinating insight to our lives in this historic event.For me, that is the lesson of the Bickers Well."},{"url":null,"title":"winton-brewery-takes-countys-micropub","story":"Steve Holligan and David Mackinnon, from Winton Brewery, stepped behind the bar at Dunbarrsquos Station Yard Micropub at the beginning of the month.Currently, the duo are only allowed to sell off-sales, due to the coronavirus lockdown preventing customers from entering the pub, but they were looking forward to once again welcoming people inside as soon as possible.Steve said: ldquoWersquove been looking for a while to find something like this.ldquoThe Station Yard is unbelievable.ldquoWe looked in Haddington, we looked in Gullane and we wanted to stay in East Lothian, where we are from and where the brewery is based.ldquoIt was one of those things where you were scrolling through Facebook and this popped up.ldquoIt was too good an opportunity and we got in touch with Gerard McPhillips [who had created the pub alongside his late business partner David McGee] and had a really good meeting with him.

Taking the best from history and finding a way to interpret it thatrsquos interesting or unexpected.All their spirits are made by hand in small batches of less than  bottles, with a direct-fired copper pot still, and aged on-site.Since launching in , they have released three distinctive gins starting with their London Dry. Believing that classics shouldnrsquot be messed with, they have stayed true to style by creating a punchy juniper-led spirit, easing into warming spices on the palate and a bone-dry finish.This was followed by their New Tom - a modern take on the ldquoOld Tom style favoured by Illicit distillers prior to London Dry. New Tom is sweeter in character: distilled with pink peppercorns, rosehips, and tonka beans, and sweetened post-distillation with bee pollen and honey.Finally, in late , Blacklist gin was released. Setting out to create a gin with the rich smouldering character of some of their favourite whiskies - bringing together Scotlands two great spirits - they smoked juniper berries over Scottish peat to impart a deep smoky flavour to the spirit.Complimented by the addition of black cardamom, lapsang souchong tea, black peppercorns, and finally infused with activated charcoal to anchor and enhance the flavour, the result is an unconventional gin - jet black in colour - and with a heady undercurrent of smouldering peat and warming spices.All three products are currently available to via their websitewith free UK delivery during the lockdown period.See illicitspirits shop------------------------------------------------------NUDIE SNACKSNudie Snacks are a local based healthy Snacking Company headquartered in Ayrshire.

With lockdown people are finding themselves in the unusual position of being at home for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and it could be a time to experiment and push the boat out.\"I think people have a new appreciation of the craft of making things like a loaf of bread. It can take  hours to make a loaf and a couple of days to make a sourdough,\" said Giovanna. \"I tried to buy yeast in the shop this week and they had run out so it shows more people are maybe making their own.\"This week has been a special celebration in the Eusebi household as her daughter Sophia turned  and Giovanna has been providing meals for Glasgow Kindness charity which is helping to feed homeless people on the street.Her mouthwatering recipes exclusively revealed for the first time today, with stunning photos by Gerardo Jaconelli, could be the perfect treat for the family and encourage people to try something new.Giovanna added: \"Now that people are time-rich I think the focus falls on our homes. We are all eating together and it is a chance to try something new.\"I have created a fresh burrata salad this week as a special starter. And for a showstopper I have created a salt-baked fish. It is something that looks really good and is a bit of a spectacle when you crack into it.\"You cant really go wrong with it or overcook it as the salt protects it. I think people should give these things a go as they have nothing to lose.\"For a little sweet treat, Giovanna has created an Italian favourite ndash tiramisu.She added: \"I thought this menu was something that people could try at home and was maybe a special Friday night dress up meal.\"With the good weather this week Giovannas bin barbecue has been put to good use, but it was a marshmallow treat that went down well with the family.BURRATA : Fennel and anchovy saladThis is a very quick and easy starter to put together. Donrsquot be afraid to substitute any ingredients. Its important to cut the creaminess of the cheese with acidity form the orange. Salmoriglio is an easy dressing that is great for using up herbs past their best. It is also excellent on steamed greens or to marinade fish.

Season to taste. Add two-thirds of dressing. Arrange on a plate. Partially tear the burrata and place on top. Scatter over pistachios and remainder of dressing. Serve.Salt Baked FishThis is a simple, stress free way to cook fish which is a showstopper. The crust acts like an oven, sealing in the moisture, allowing the fish to cook in its on juices.

They go at it like bargain hunters rummaging in a sale. The hills are hidden by mist and as we have breakfast, the village green is empty, apart from two scampering young squirrels, getting their hourrsquos daily exercise. A glossy male pheasant hurries down the lane ashersquos late for church. Yesterday he was making a racket in the next-door garden, ashe owned the place. Once hersquos gone, nothing stirs in Hoolet until mid-morning, when a cyclist goes past, bent over her narrow wheels like a racer in a Sempeacute cartoon. Shortly afterwards, a police car drives by. The sun has burned off the mist, and by eleven it almost feels like summer. Sundays are always leisurely here, but since lockdown, they stretch to infinity.A week after arriving in Hoolet, I started a diary. It is not the sort that the writer secretly hopes will be found posthumously and published as a literary masterpiece, more a haphazard reminder of how we have adjusted to a dferent mode of living, and a record of the people and wildle around us.Real diarists have a natural ability to condense the essence of a day into a few lines, but they put as much thought into their prose as any novelist or poet. In some ways theirs is an even harder task, because it requires a special kind of imagination and flair to turn the everyday ndash each and every day ndash into something noteworthy.The proleration of citizen diarists airing their thoughts on the coronavirus crisis has turned my mind to diaries. My own random jottings occasionally refer to the crisis, but there is something paralysing about its scale that makes it hard to capture in the passing, seemingly casual way diarising requires. Instead, I am absorbed by the outdoors: the new hole Irsquove found among the roots of the beech hedge ndash foraging thrush or resident rodent  the absence of the toad that moved into our rockery two years ago and the arrival of fat, low-flying bumblebees, which zig-zag across the garden, loud as drones.The great diarists, from Pepys and Dorothy Wordsworth to Alan Bennett, donrsquot need a crisis to fill their pages, but when one comes along, their perspective is invaluable. History ndash as this awful situation one day will be ndash is at its most immediate when captured in small personal details demonstrating one inidual getting by. Thatrsquos why I enjoy diaries so much, and there are none I like better than those that are country-based.This wasnrsquot always the case. I remember as a girl a book whose flowery cover filled me with the same dread as the thought of being obliged to wear a flouncy frock. The Diary of an Edwardian Lady was a bestseller in the late s. A beautully illustrated journal it was by Edith Holden, an artist from Birmingham. Reading it now, I realise what I was missing. The drawings of birds and plants are charming, and the entries show a woman after my own heart. The one for  April, , reads: ldquoSaw two live vipers which had been brought in from the moor one of them was more than two feet long. The gentleman who had captured them handled them quite fearlessly, held up one by the back of the neck and forcing its mouth open with a stick, he showed me the two little pink fangs in the upper jaw. When on the ground they reared themselves up and hissed, and struck repeatedly at a walking stick placed in front of them.Irsquove yet to see a snake in Hoolet, so have added that to the wish list. I did once almost step on an adder barefoot as a young child, in Tarland, Aberdeenshire, where it slithered out of the tree stump I was perched on. I got a closer look some years later, on a Borders forest track, where one was sunning itself. Like a fool, I got within touching distance, thinking it was dead, before it unfurled itself like a Catherine Wheel and disappeared into the undergrowth.Living as I do with a diary anthologist, the house is filled with them. Among my favourites is the th-century clergyman, the Reverend James Woodforde, who lived in Norfolk. Better than any documentary, he brings his shire alive with accounts of chimneys going on fire, deaths on horseback, moonlit evenings when hersquod go out for bibulous dinners he later regretted. Most pertinently for Alan this past  days when, with all dentistsrsquo practices and dental hospitals indefinitely closed, desperate measures have been contemplated, Woodforde gives an account of having a tooth pulled in . It was not a success: ldquohe broke away a great Piece of my Gum and broke one of the Fangs of the Tooth it gave me exquisite Pain all the Day after and my Face swelled prodigiously. He realised too late that the chap was no longer in his prime: ldquoHe is too old I think to draw Teeth, canrsquot see very well.Country diarists record fox hunts and deer stalking, tree-felling storms, village feuds, cake competitions and frog-spawnings, but there is relatively little about the great affairs of state. During World War One, for instance, Alice Dudney, from Lewes, reports her own war against slugs with far greater assiduity than what was taking place on the western front. I donrsquot think this was because country dwellers in previous centuries were less interested in the news, evenit sometimes arrived days or weeks after events. But back then, country living was hard. What was happening on your doorstep was of more pressing concern unless loved ones were in the firing line.Itrsquos quite the opposite in Hoolet. The few conversations now held ndash through a hedge, across a garden wall, or in passing up in the woods ndash are all about the pandemic, and the best stratagems for getting by. A diary on this subject alone risks deepening the gloom. Where better to find distraction and consolation than in whatrsquos going on right outside the window  Such as the wonderful news that a blue tit has moved into the nest box on our garden shed ndash the original definition of Airbnb.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Instead, the site suggests mixing it with green tea as a natural toner.Should you be missing the skin-smoothing effect of an eye-watering beauty salon chemical peel, you may want to follow the online sitersquos alternative: granulated sugar, mixed with olive oil then a right good rub.For those who can spare some beer, its yeast content will help fight excessive sebum production and the bacteria that causes acne.Mix with egg whites and mashed strawberries then use as a face pack ndash or just pretend itrsquos a beery kind of meringue and eat it.While the websitersquos store cupboard treatments may seem a shade desperate, according to Claire Gray of Glasgow-based skincare specialist Ermana, there is real merit in seeking out a more natural approach to our skincare regimes.ldquoAt the moment, most of us are focused on shopping for essentials such as food and medicine, and skincare is often viewed as a luxury product, she says.ldquoBut all this time indoors and washing our hands is having an impact on our skin.For eyes strained from peering too long at Tiger King on Netflix, she has an age-old remedy: ldquoThe tannins in tea can help reduce puffiness and get rid of dark circles. Simply soak a tea bag in warm water and place on your eyes for  minutes.ldquoFor an astringent or toner, wipe a teabag over your face to tighten skin and then blot with a towel.With coffee shops closed and our espresso fix now confined to home, there is a use for all those spent coffee grounds. ldquoSimply add some coffee grounds to coconut oil to make your own at-home scrub, she says.ldquoThe coffee grains help remove dirt and dead skin cells and promote overall skin health, and the scrubbing action stimulates blood flow and can help to reduce cellulite.ldquoThe caffeine in coffee grounds has potent antioxidant properties that can help protect the skin from sun damage.While honeyrsquos antibacterial, anti-fungal and antiseptic properties mean it makes a handy face mask, so too do the fats, minerals and vitamins in mashed avocado.Pineapple is almost a skincare superfood: vitamin C, bromelain and antioxidants can help prevent and treat acne, fine lines, sun damage and uneven tone. Rub it on, leave for a few minutes and rinse off.Gray suggests therersquos even a skincare use for that bottle of apple cider vinegar lurking at the back of the cupboard. ldquoThe main ingredient in apple cider vinegar is acetic acid but it also contains lots of other natural alpha-hydroxy acids, she says.ldquoThese work together to gently exfoliate the skin by dissolving dead skin cells. Applying apple cider vinegar to the skin also delivers beneficial enzymes, proteins and good bacteria.With hand-washing a national hobby, she suggests taking particular care when choosing which soaps to buy.ldquoHandwashes contain water and any product with water has preservatives to stop it degrading. Andit says lsquoparfumrsquo on the bottle, itrsquoll have a multitude of sins.ldquoItrsquos much better to choose a natural soap, such as one made with olive oil.Helen Atherton of Edinburgh-based soap specialist, Dook, agrees that while washing hands with soap is a proven virus-killer, many harsh supermarket soaps will also wreck our hands.ldquoThe dference between a bar of handmade soap and a manufactured one is huge, she says. ldquoIn handmade soaps, the natural glycerine thatrsquos squeezed out in the industrial process is retained. So handmade soap is much kinder but will still destroy viruses.She uses coconut oil, shea butter, essential oils and Himalayan salt to make her organic soap, but strongly advises against attempting to break out the saucepans to rustle up your own bar.ldquoIf yoursquore not careful, homemade soap can go a bit rubbish ndash therersquos chemistry involved, caustic soda.

There is no other artist who documented Glasgow so extraordinarily during that period. Itrsquos not enough for Scottish art and big institutions like Kelvingrove to be limited to the most popular names like the Glasgow Boys, Jack Vettriano or Charles Rennie Mackintosh.ldquoPeople are very familiar with the work of the Glasgow Boys. But Glasgow has other painters. Therersquos a Glasgow Girl. Shersquos not even Scottish but came here and fell in love with the city to such an extent that she painted it throughout her short le. Eardley is a hugely important British artist and she should have a major exhibition in a British institution of note, like the Tate.Eardley was born on May , , on a dairy farm in Warnham, Sussex. Her family later moved to London and then, in , amid the growing threat of war, to Bearsden.The following year, she began her studies at Glasgow School of Art and proved fearless in her pursuit of subjects to paint. Her wanderings brought her to impoverished Townhead in the northeast of the city, where she established a studio. The paintings Eardley did there ndash particularly her famous portraits of the Samson children ndash are considered landmarks of th-century art.For her niece Anne Morrison, a Bearsden-based ceramicist, Eardleyrsquos relationship with an urban district which was facing the demolition ball is an example of just how daring and exceptional she was.ldquoTownhead was just not the area that you would go to ndash I was kept well away from it, she said. ldquoEven my brother, who was a couple of years older, said he had never been up there either. It was not the place to be. It was just the poverty and seeing what that part of Glasgow looked like. Middle-class kids just did not get taken there.ldquoShe actually caught something that was disappearing at the time, as the buildings were getting knocked down and people were getting moved where. It captured something of the city and the children there. Itrsquos not glorying it but itrsquos capturing it in a very human way.Morrison suggested that the lack of a major event to mark the centenary of Eardleyrsquos birth could have something to do with the Scottishness of her work.ldquoIt does seem right to have a celebration of her work but it does not seem to be happening, she added. ldquoHer name gets forgotten. She has not had the recognition at a UK level that she should. Thatrsquos the trouble. Shersquos a Scottish artist and she gets put aside because her subjects were Scottish as well.Laura Cumming, art critic for The Observer, described Eardley as ldquoone of the deepest landscape artists who ever lived, and among the most humanitarian painters of men, women and especially children.She added: ldquoEvery opportunity to see her work is precious ndash anywhere at all.ldquoThere have been shows in Scotland, the last that I remember was in . She deserves many more, and so the ideal would be a touring show that took in London, presenting her work throughout the United Kingdom to a new generation. Next year must not be allowed to slip by without a full-scale retrospective of her powerfully stirring and beautul work.Arts journalist Jan Patience said: ldquoThe National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh has done a power of work to cement her reputation with two major shows in the last  years, but there has been no major Eardley show for years in Glasgow, the city she called home. I believe the last one was in what was then called The Third Eye Centre in the s.ldquoAn Eardley show in Glasgow would attract visitors in their thousands and a no-show in her centenary year shows a real lack of vision.Local authorities in Scotlandrsquos largest cities said events were being organised or considered to mark the anniversary.A spokeswoman for Glasgow Le said: ldquoAs one of Scotlandrsquos most popular th-century artists we anticipate a small programme of events to mark Joan Eardleyrsquos centenary.ldquoWe are pleased to have a small number of her drawings and paintings in our collection, which includes the much-loved oil Glasgow Kids, a Saturday Matineacutee Picture Queue, on show in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. However, we do not hold the breadth of works required to stage a standalone exhibition.An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: ldquoEardleyrsquos work is showcased as one of the Our Collection highlights in Gallery  ndash Collecting Art and her work can be seen throughout the collections galleries. A number of the oils we own are on display, including a powerful seascape painted at Catterline.ldquoThe  centenary of Joan Eardleyrsquos birth presents a welcome opportunity for us to celebrate the artistrsquos strong connection with the northeast of Scotland in a number of ways.A spokesman for Leisure and Culture Dundee, which runs the McManus Gallery and Museum, said: ldquoWe have no current plans to mark the Joan Eardley centenary next year.A spokesman for the National Galleries of Scotland said: ldquoThe National Galleries celebrated the le and work of Joan Eardley in a comprehensive exhibition just three years ago, and the exhibitionrsquos curator Patrick Elliott, a leading expert on Eardley, is writing a book on Eardley and Catterline as part of the centenary celebrations. All future plans, including publication of this book and our exhibition schedule, are subject to review due to the ongoing health crisis. However, we do intend on marking Eardleyrsquos centenary next summer, in one form or another.The Tate galleries declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-time-scotland-go-way-lockdown","story":"This independent group, whose membership remains a closely guarded secret, finds itself centre stage at present due to the ongoing critical issues linked to the Coronavirus. The fact that Mr Cummings and his fellow Vote Leave strategist, Ben Warner, appear to have taken part in SAGE deliberations must be of serious concern to anyone who believes in an open-minded and independent group ldquofollowing the science and arriving at decisions concerning the virus for the common good and not tainted with political overtones.From all accounts it would seem that Mr Cummings has been an active participant in discussions and decision-making rather than simply an interested observer. This becomes more sinister and of grave concern when you consider his well-publicised contempt for the NHS, record of electoral fraud and more than a passing interest in the field of eugenics. Mr Cummings was allegedly an advocate of a herd immunity strategy for the UK in early March, which was mirrored by the Prime Ministerrsquos ldquo take it on the chin ramblings as the Government tried to figure out how to cope with the virus without losing support or damaging the economy. In short, Mr Cummingsrsquos presence on SAGE whilst denying a place for the chief medical officers of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales is firm evidence that the Conservative Government is placing unfair political pressure on the group to ensure the science matches their political message both for the pre and post- lockdown periods.The First Minister has opened discussions about what a gradual ending to the lockdown may look like in the weeks and months ahead whilst at the same time, influential Conservative groups like the  Committee has stressed that businesses must be allowed to restart the economy as soon as possible, eventhere remains a signicant tangible risk to le. Government pressure on our experts must not sacrice lives for party ideology and wealth creation. Economies bounce back but, sadly, people do not.Whilst Nicola Sturgeon has talked of using Angela Merkelrsquos Germany as a model in future planning, the Prime Ministers first post-inidual virus communication was with President Trump, a public advocate of disinfectant injections to cure the virus.It may well be time for Scotland to erge from the UK Government in easing the lockdown in the immediate future. I trust that the Scottish Government will take dficult decisions based on the science available and for the welfare of the people. I have no such confidence in Mr Johnson or his amoral colleagues and advisers.Owen Kelly, Stirling.THE SNPs Commons leader, Ian Blackford, was arguably correct to criticise Boris Johnson for missing five Cobra meetings earlier in the year. What therefore will be his response to Nicola Sturgeon missing six such meetings in January and February She seemingly felt it more important to be playing netball or popping into a primary school ndash all self-publicised on social media. Ms Sturgeons spokesperson complains she sometimes doesnt have much notice of the crucial meetings. Ms Sturgeon: more than , people have died from Covid- so far across the world ndashworth some last minute diary rearrangement Martin Redfern, Edinburgh EH.NICOLA Sturgeon made it clear in the days leading up to last Thursdays press briefing that she would not be able to publish definite times and details about Scotlands journey out of lockdown, and I am sure that none of the grown-ups Ms Sturgeon was addressing expected her to suddenly pull up the shutters on our shops and and open all the pubs.I must disagree with Allan Thompsonwhen he accuses Ms Sturgeon of talking a lot but saying nothing. She made it clear that any steps which would be taken would be small and tentative, and that she was not going to take chances with the lives and health of Scotlands people. She did say that possible initiatives might allow some pupils toto school, in a safe and phased way, and that some businesses might be allowed to re-openthey could guarantee the two-metres-apart rule. The First Minister also urged people to read Coronavirus : Framework for Decision Making which is on the Scottish Government Website, and sets out the approach which will guide Ms Sturgeon and her governments decisions on transitioning out of lockdown.In opening this conversation with the public, Ms Sturgeon offered us all some hope, and the prospect of a light at the end of a very dark tunnel.Ruth Marr, Stirling.DIED \"with\" Covid-, or died \"of from due to\" it  I am getting confused.Until recently I thought the dference was made clear by the adage that more men die with prostate cancer than of it, and that sloppy reporting in the media was to blame for the blurring of the line.But now it appears the health authorities themselves, and not only in the UK, have questions to answer their political masters too.For example, the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator has admitted to counting deaths as Covid- that really had other causes: ldquoIf someone dies with Covid-, we are counting that as a Covid- death. Which means the number of those really dying of it is much lower.So why the trashing of our economy through this excessive lockdown  Sweden has  per cent fewer deaths per million than the UK, despite its light-touch measures. Is our Government perhaps on a power high, enjoying curtailing civil liberties such as being out without \"reasonable excuse\", while some of their class have been rumbled ignoring the instruction In the winter of  , England alone lost , people to the flu, yet neither the Government nor the media batted an eyelid. All businesses and shops remained open, as did schools, restaurants, charities, churches, parks, and everywhere .If Westminster and Holyrood persist with their stubborn, inflexible diktats, the long-term effect on public health will be far worse than the virus. Only a healthy economy can finance a sound NHS.George Morton, Rosyth.WHILST accepting the requirement to adhere to the guidelines in order to keep us safe from this horric virus, I must point out the serious and obvious inconsistencies emanating from Government with regard to those guidelines.For instance, prior to the lockdown, it was possible to play golf in wide open spaces in the fresh air and it was easy to adhere to the social distancing and yet, at the time of writing, golf courses are closed I have just visited our local BQ store, which is open to the public with adherence to social distancing measures and this obviously involved shopping in an enclosed area which, with due care, presented absolutely no problem at all.There are many other examples of such inconsistency which the Governmentsfail to recognise and this is not conducive to good mental health with such unnecessary and illogical confinement being forced upon us.Unless and until good common-sense prevails, I fear that we could be heading towards civil unrest and disobedience on a major scale. Are you listening, Nicola Sturgeon James F McGilvray, Edinburgh EH.I FULLY understand, and completely accept, the need for the ongoing lockdown, and I follow all the rules as set out by the Scottish Government.But there is no advice coming out of the Government other than \"stay home\" or lsquoself-isolatersquo, to protect our Health Service.After four weeks, even minor illnesses or irritations are becoming a major issue and there is no advice on how to deal with any of these. How can anyone deal with foot issues, dental problems, eye irritations or back painwe have no access to chiropodists, dental practitioners, opticians or chiropractors because they are not allowed to go about their normal businesses  With very little access to our GPs, and the pharmacist no longer in a position to offer helpful advice or remedies, how are we expected to cope with worsening \"minor\" health problems These are issues that need to be addressed in the very near term, and with a high degree of urgency, or the lock down is going to lead to an epidemic of illnesses that need not have developedproperly treated.We need targeted advice and help.Francis Deigman, Erskine.TO all those whinging about the economic damage being caused by the Covid- shutdown: maybe, just maybe,we hadnt made the economy take first and foremost priority over everything  in our lives, we wouldnt be in the current mess were in right now Previous generations can plead ignorance, but ndash especially after recent \"near misses\" with HN and SARS ndash in an age of mass literacy and the internet, for these events to happen on our generations watch is unforgivable.When all this is over,once more we place \"the economy\" ndash the omnipotent god of the godless ndash on the highest pedestal exalted and above all other considerations, cutting corners and turning blind eyes to risks for the sake of \"the \", well deserve a worse pandemic than this with bells on.Mark Boyle, Johnstone.NEW Zealanders shared the UKs relief when Prime Minister Johnson came out of intensive care, and we were proud when he singled out a Kiwi nurse, Jenny, and her Portuguese colleague, Luiacutes, for their skill and dedication. The New Zealand health system has many fine nurses who would like the experience of working with the NHS in Scotland, where, like my daughter, they have family links.The irony of Mr Johnsonrsquos heartfelt praise is that the UKs nurse registration requirements are so tough as to put off many qualied and experienced Kiwi nurses from even trying.The application fee of NZ is a monthrsquos salary the language test is notorious for failing even those who communicate very well in their native English and the practical competency test must be taken in the UK. As a result, the NHS has missed out on many fine Jennys. Other countries, including the Republic of Ireland, are more welcoming. A change in the UKrsquos system would be a fine thing to come from this tragic pandemic.Dr Richard Gordon, Christchurch, New Zealand.Read more: Letters: Government must focus on care homes to help bring us out of lockdown"},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  The lockdown exit plan is ageist  Over-70s can decide what   s best for their health","story":"They are a mixture of the married, orced and widowed.

Nor yet do I yearn to feel a stf breeze around my Cairngorms. But it seems there are those with no such qualms, folk who traipse hither and also yon, letting it all hang out.According to the latest intelligence, the number of folk joining British Naturism, the nudie body representing nudie bodies, has risen by  per cent since the coronavirus lockdown began.With their brains boiling in the recent hot weather, normally upright ratepayers have apparently taken to stoating aboot their gardens in the scud, and have now acquired a taste for the peculiar practice.In a discombobulating development, therersquos even to be a World Naked Gardening Day on May . You just have to hope theyrsquoll be careful with their secateurs when approaching folkrsquos sprinklers.The new development has caused alarm among influential sectors of British society. In an editorial, the Daily Star newspaper thundered: ldquoBlimey. What is this reserved country coming to That is a good question, well put. The paper says, correctly, that naturism conjures images of old men playing tennis and volleyball, but adds that this seems set to change.If that is indeed the case, Irsquod be worried about the younger, er, members. These tend to have minds of their own.Still, live and let live and all that. Naturism has quite a venerable history by now. Its origins are usually traced to the Fellowship of the Naked Trust, founded in India in  by an English civil servant attached to the British Raj. And they say no good came of the Empire.Back in Blighty, the movement proved particularly popular with ldquoalternative folk, such as socialists who believed in sharing their assets, and vegetarians not averse to displaying their meat and two veg.Despite that, naturism has long had a reputation for being cranky ndash it is popular in Germany, for example ndash and,you would care to peruse your subscription copy of Health and Efficiency magazine, you will see that it does not attract many supermodels.All the same, you would think it might still attract the wrong sorts, people with ulterior motives. However, these tend to be easily exposed.To be frank,we have more hot weather and further lockdowns, I am concerned that the British people will truly go doolally. I can picture scenes of our newly authoritarian police orices chasing wide-eyed, wobbly-bellied, naked people down the street. Not orices. Officers. Jeezus.My own feeling is that naturism, as with other weird cult activities such as cycling and jogging, is all very well as long as it is practised in the privacy of onersquos own home.I, for one, have no wish ever to see naked old men pinging their dead rubbers at tennis or, worse still, asking folk to pump up their deflated volleyballs.Never knowingly understoodPOOR old John Lewis. The peoplersquos store that got too posh canrsquot buy good PR at the moment.The latest blow was the revelation that, while the chain suffered and staff lost jobs, it did the classic British thing of paying off its former managing director with nearly a million squids. Bewildered shopfloor workers, receiving record low bonuses, also learned that another top boss had been paid nearly pound, a year.Of course : theyrsquod just go abroadthey werenrsquot paid such ridiculous sums. Er, this news just in: No. They. Wouldnrsquot. Stop talking tripe.John Lewis lost it years ago, becoming too expensive, too geared towards the waxed jacket brigade, too complacent, and too much about coffee.Nobody even knows what its daft, dated motto ldquonever knowingly undersold even means any more and, when they put it through Google translate , they find that, particularly in these days of online shopping, itrsquos utterly meaningless anyway.The internut is awash with folk highlighting items that can be bought much cheaper where. As with its self-consciously snooty sister, Waitrose ndash where your normally expected shopping of  quid turns out nearer  ndash in John Lewis some of the prices are eye-watering.Last time I was there, the price tags on designer duds in the menrsquos clothing department made me giddy. And Irsquom a man renowned for self-control and sobriety.There was a time when John Lewis represented the epitome of British civilisation. It was accessible to all, a pleasant place full of quality items, staffed by polite, contented assistants.It can be the same again. If Boris Johnson can restore England to its former glory, then surely someone can bring back the John Lewis that we all once knew and loved.Five things we learned this week Struggling clothing chain Primark was founded in .

strategy Test, track and trace means testing people for coronavirus, tracking the spread of the virus, then tracing the people an infected person has come into contact with.If someone tests positive, they will then need to isolate for at least seven days, while high-risk contacts could be asked to self-isolate.ndash How will it help combat the spread of the virus Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said the strategy could help to suppress the transmission of Covid- in a way that then allows less stringent rules.:What coronavirus restrictions are in place around the world But Mr Hancock has also said that coronavirus cases need to drop substantially before the next phase of isolating infected people and their contacts can be truly effective.The theory is that once lockdown measures have reduced the infection rate, it will be easier to use the test, track and trace approach to keep track of new cases.ndash What is the first stage Crucially, people will first need to knowthey have coronavirus.The Government has pledged to carry out , tests a day by the end of April, and has widened the eligibility criteria to include all key workers.The only tests currently available check whether a person has coronavirus by looking for antigens.They do not show whether a person has previously had the virus, as reliable antibody tests have yet to be found.ndash What happens next The Government wants to track Covid- in the population to try to understand the current rate of infection alongside how many people have developed antibodies to the virus.Mr Hancock said , people will take part in the first phase of a large-scale testing study, with plans to expand it to up to , over the next  months.For the study, initial findings from which are expected in early May, all participants will be tested to seethey currently have coronavirus, while adults in , of the households will provide blood samples to find out what proportion of the population has developed antibodies.Once someone has tested positive, contact tracing will be essential to slow the spread.ndash What is contact tracing Contact tracing is the process of reducing virus transmission by identying and alerting people who may have been exposed so that they can protect themselves and others around them.Once someone has tested positive for coronavirus, clinicians will gather information about places they have visited and people they have been in contact with to get a detailed picture of who might be at risk of infection.People could be asked to self-isolatethey are at a higher risk of infection, PHE added.ndash How is this being rolled out To help with contact tracing, , people are now being recruited who will help noty those who have come in contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus.An NHS app is currently being developed which could identy people who have been in proximity to a smartphone user who subsequently develops coronavirus symptoms and tell them to self-isolate.ndash How will the app work Using Bluetooth Low Energy signals, the app will log each time it comes into close range of other devices also running the app.The app keeps an anonymous record of all these logs securely on a userrsquos phone.:Members of public to get chance to ask question at No  daily press conferenceIf someone develops symptoms of Covid-, they can use the app to inform the NHS, which will then trigger an anonymous alert to any other app users the infected person came into contact with by analysing the collected logs.The app will then advise what action to take, including telling people to self-isolatenecessary.ndash When is the NHS app expected to be released A date for the apprsquos release has not been confirmed and it remains in the development and

I am very pleased that the feasibility study has demonstrated the viability of a fixed link, which will be a huge benefit to local residents - reducing their travel time and removing the need to pay signicant ferry fares.ldquoFrom the estimated costs, it is clear that the Council will need the Scottish Government to recognise this infrastructure as part of the delivery of the new National Transport Strategy. Residents can be assured we will all be pressing home our strong case for investment.Martin Johnson, interim director of strategy and regional economy at HIE, said: ldquoNew fixed links can offer the potential to open up rural areas to additional economic and employment opportunities, which in turn improve community resilience.

The decision about how the dferent combinations go together is for ministers.Prof Whitty added: ldquoThere is no perfect solution where we are going to end up being able to do all the things people want and at the same time keep R below one, so there are going to have to be some very dficult choiceshellipand choices around schools will be one of those.Earlier, Boris Johnson addressed the nation from the steps of No  and urged it to ldquokeep going as he made clear the lockdown restrictions would continue.The Prime Minister said the coronavirus was the countryrsquos single biggest challenge since the Second World War and echoed Winston Churchillrsquos famous phrase about the ldquobeginning of the end, saying Britain was ldquocoming now to the end of the first phase of this conflict.He insisted the country was ldquobeginning to turn the tide against Covid- but warned that now was the moment of ldquomaximum risk, that going too early in lting the restrictions would risk a ldquonew wave of death and disease but also an economic disaster.As the next lockdown review date is on May , Mr Johnson spoke about ldquoin the coming days how the Government would reveal how it might ldquobegin gradually to refine the economic and social restrictions.In other developments -*the UK Government announced families of NHS and social care workers who have lost loved ones to the pandemic would be entitled to a pound, payment in England. The Scottish Government will receive a share of the available money and is considering introducing a similar scheme north of the border. A spokesman said: ldquoWe are working with partners to finalise the schemersquos terms and conditions and aim to publish further details by May  with scheme benefits applying retrospectively to ensure no one is disadvantaged.*UK ministers are unlikely to announce this week whether the Government has or has not reached its target of , coronavirus tests a day by Thursday because of a ldquotime-lag in reporting the test results. Up to am on Saturday, some , tests had been carried out across Scotland, England and Wales while capacity was almost , a day.*Matt Hancock, the UK Health Secretary, announced because of the lowering in hospitalisations due to Covid-, the NHS in England would begin the restoration of other NHS services, ldquostarting with the most urgent, like cancer care and mental health support\"."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11307428.jpg?type=article-full","title":"coronavirus-fund-raising-hero-captain-tom-gets-amazing-100th-birthday-surprise","story":"The Second World War veteran, widely known as Captain Tom, has raised more than pound million for the NHS by walking laps of his garden in Bedfordshire.He has been praised around the world for his fundraising campaign and many have thanked him in the form of a birthday card.Ahead of his landmark birthday on Thursday, more than , cards have been sent to Bedford School where his grandson, Benjie Ingram-Moore, attends.Cards were also sent from famous names including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Dame Kelly Holmes and England football captain Harry Kane.Benjie turned to his school for help when he learned that the post office was being swamped with cards.The -year-old said: ldquoThe volume of cards that have been sent to granddad is just astonishing. So many of the cards are truly heartfelt with thousands from young children who have taken the time to use their artistic talent and write a personal message.ldquoAnother pound, has been generously been donated via his birthday cards.ldquoIt means a lot to granddad as well as us as a family. We are hugely proud of how the nation has taken granddad to its heart. Words canrsquot express how much I idolise him.A view of just some of the cards Captain Tom has received so farCaptain Tom was originally planning to mark his centenary with a family party but the celebrations have been put on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic.Benjie said: ldquoThe swathes of birthday cards and messages from celebrities including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Dame Kelly Holmes and England captain Harry Kane have left granddad speechless and more than made up for his cancelled birthday plans.ldquoHe is truly humbled by the response to his walking in the garden.A total of  members of school staff, parents and pupils past and present spent , hours opening each card and creating a display in Bedford Schoolrsquos Great Hall.Hugh Maltby, director of Bedford School Association, said: ldquoBenjie has been such an inspiration in his grandfatherrsquos campaign that we wanted to offer a way of giving back.ldquoWhen the family told us about all the cards being received at their local post office, I didnrsquot hesitate to offer schoolrsquos support to help open and display the cards.Headmaster James Hodgson said: ldquoWe are so very proud to see how far Benjie has come with this ndash the story of his grandfather, Captain Tom Moore, has captured the nation and is a real affirmation of peoplersquos kindness.ldquoWe are honoured to offer our Great Hall at Bedford School with our team of volunteers to act as both a makesht sorting office and a place to display the incredible number of th birthday cards.It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson called on the nation to show the same optimism and energy as Captain Tom in dealing with the coronavirus crisis.Speaking in Downing Street after battling Covid-, Mr Johnson praised the fundraiser.ldquoIf we, as a country, can show the same spirit of optimism and energy shown by Captain Tom Moore, who turns  this week,we can show the same spirit of unity and determination as we have all shown in the past six weeks, then I have absolutely no doubt that we will beat it together, he said.ldquoWe will come through this all the faster and the United Kingdom will emerge stronger than ever before.In another tribute to Captain Tom, all mail sent from Monday will be stamped with a special postmark in his honour.The Royal Mail postmark, which will be applied to all stamped post between April  and May , reads: ldquoHappy th Birthday Captain Thomas Moore NHS fundraising hero th April .The fundraiserrsquos original target of pound, was broken in around  hours and he extended his challenge to  laps after he completed the first  two weeks ahead of schedule."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"April ,  at : pmA new online portal is offering thousands of free-to-access online learning materials to those who have been furloughed or made redundant.

However, he urged the Justice Secretary to reflect on what was happening in England and Wales, where court services were making use of telephone, video and other technology to allow remote hearings and procedural business to take place.Kirkwall Sherf Court has been closed due to the coronavirus crisis, with emergency business transferred to a ‘hub’ in Inverness. However, concerns have been raised about the impact of this transfer, as well as obstacles in the way of securing new ship orders and Powers of Attorney.The Justice Secretary acknowledged these concerns, and offered to pursue the issue with the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service.Mr McArthur said: “Nothing is ‘business as usual’ at the moment, and the well-being of court staff and the wider public has to be the number one priority.  However, there are many aspects of civil court business that we cannot afford to put on pause.“Over recent weeks, I have been contacted by local solicitors in Orkney, extremely concerned at the dficulties they have faced in getting urgent business completed.  Delays in getting a new ship Orders or Powers of Attorney in place, for example, can have serious consequences. Vulnerable people rely on effective and timely court processes that make sure their rights are properly safeguarded.“In England and Wales we are seeing technology being used to enable more court business to be undertaken. There is no reason why a similar approach cannot be adopted in Scotland.  Indeed, Sherf Courts already conduct procedural hearings by tele-conferencing.“The justice secretary insists that progress is being made, but has offered to take up these concerns with the Scottish Court and Tribunals Service. I welcome that assurance and hope it will allow access to justice for more people in Orkney, and where in Scotland, who need it.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The yoga postures we’ll be doing in the sessions bring some easy, relaxing movements for the body. Mindfulness allows us to be in the present moment rather than worrying about the past or future which can make it easier to accept change and to make the adjustments necessary to feel well.”Angela Mitchell, national director of Diabetes Scotland, said: “We are proud to have over  local groups serving communities across Scotland. Of course, not everyone can attend a group, especially now when we’re advised against all but essential trips out of our homes.“We had already planned to introduce digital peer support groups this year but due to social distancing measures we brought our launch forward.  Many people at home are feeling isolated and,you’re also managing a long-term condition like diabetes, it can be even more challenging. We want to support people with diabetes in any way that we can at this time. As well as online peer support groups, yoga and mindfulness, we also have a helpline, online forum and the Diabetes Scotland team can be reached as we continue to work from home.”Groups meet in private sessions over Zoom. Peer support group times are still flexible while a schedule is created to meet demand. Mindfulness and yoga will run on Wednesdays at pm and Fridays at pm for the next four weeks.Anyone who is interested in joining either peer support or mindfulness and yoga should email scotland@diabetes.org.uk to be invited to a group and given instructions on how to access Zoom .Guidance regarding diabetes and coronavirus can be found at www.diabetes.org.uk coronavirus or by calling the Diabetes Scotland helpline on    or emailing helpline@diabetes.org.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In challenging circumstances, however, they are not helped by supply chains that are simply not operating fairly or equitably.“During a recent conference call with the cabinet secretary and islands minister, I raised concerns about the behaviour of some suppliers towards our island communities. It was a call echoed by MSP and MP colleagues from across the parties.“Unfortunately, two weeks on and shop owners and local wholesalers, who also supply our care homes and hospital, tell me little has changed. If anything, the situation is getting more serious.“I welcome Fergus Ewing’s recognition of the problem and the action he has taken in writing to  of the main suppliers. However, these efforts must now be redoubled as we need to see a dference on the ground.The Orkney MSP added: “At a time of crisis, getting access to food and essential items should not be a postcode lottery.

This might included certain businesses being allowed to reopen where customers can safely stay at a two metre distance, and the reformatting of classrooms before pupils canto schools.The First Minister has advised that restrictions are likely to continue in some form for at least the rest of this year, and possibly beyond that.She added that the Scottish Government would be relying on the latest data to inform it of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing. When asked about whether certain regions of Scotland might undergo a more localised approach, the First Minister said she wasn#t ruling out anything that might help us deal with the virus.#Today I am seeking to start a grown up conversation with the public about the complex decisions that lie ahead of us as we look beyond lockdown,# she said.“As we have done all along, we will seek to inform the public with the best scientic advice possible, but the science will never be exact and we are in uncharted territory so we also need to make careful judgements and be prepared to adapt and change course as we go.“We want to ease restrictions, but we cannot rule out having to reapply them should the virus run out of control.#Nicola Sturgeon said she and her colleagues would be relying on the latest data to inform them of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing.“Every day we see evidence that this virus causes real harm, but so too do the lockdown measures we are taking to contain it,# she continued.#This is causing harm to the economy and living standards, to children’s education and to mental health and wellbeing.“That is why we need to try to find a better balance than the one we have now, but as we do so we cannot take our eye off the need to suppress the virus and minimise the damage it does.“It is only when we are sure the virus is under control that we can even start to ease any of the restrictions because the virus will not have gone away.#Nicola Sturgeon has advised everyone to take part in the conversation about how we might leave lockdown.

Until late last year, a suitable vessel proved dficult to source, said the council.It then became known that the Nordic Sea, which operated on a number of passenger routes in the far north of Norway, had become available.Following visits and sea trials involving Orkney Marine Services and Orkney Ferries staff, the vessel was considered as a suitable replacement for the Golden Mariana.As the Nordic Sea was operating under a Norwegian Passenger Certicate, it was known that a number of requirements would have to be met before she was considered ready for a UK passenger certicate.With surveys now completed and a works list developed, the decision to complete the purchase was made and the vessel departed Bergen for Orkney yesterday morning, Thursday.On arrival, the vessel was handed over to Orkney Islands Council, but due to Covid- restrictions and the need for some works to be carried out to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication, it will be a while yet before the residents of Papa Westray are able to benefit from their new passenger ferry.The purchase of the new vessel was part funded by the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland.More details in The Orcadian Marine Scene section next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

For urban wildle, which includes mammals and birds living alongside people in towns, this will affect levels of disturbance from humans and food availability.In recent weeks there have already been reports of animals adapting to the reduced human activity including Kashmiri goats roaming around Llandudno, North Wales, troops of monkeys in Singapore, wild boars in cities across Europe and Coyotes wandering streets during daylight hours in the US.Lead researcher Professor Dawn Scott, an expert in Mammal Ecology and Conservation, will use this unprecedented time to try to collect information and answer the study’s overarching question # How have urban animals responded to changes in human activity during the COVID- lockdown The research will collect records on any observations of unusual animal behaviour during the lockdown, determine the effects of reduction in human activity in city and town centres on urban wildle, and the effects increased human activity in gardens and outdoors space is having. The data from the survey will then be combined with other data from media searches to produce a report on the response of urban animals to lockdown across the globe.Professor Scott, head of the School of Le Sciences at Keele University, said: “Urban animals have been able to adapt to our landscape and live alongside towns, cities and suburbs so we know they are already highly adaptable. This flexibility in behaviour means they can usually quickly respond to changing conditions, including the absence of humans, which is happening during the lockdown.“Across the world we have seen reports of animals roaming cities and in locations that they wouldn’t normally be seen during the day. Social isolation is an opportunity for many to learn more about nature and how we can support it. We’re asking people to take part in our study and help us discover how urban animals are responding due to our change in behaviour.”To find out more and take part in the study visit: www.keele.ac.uk wildlestudycopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

It is expected to be pressed into service as soon as possible.Health board chairman said demand for testing on the Scottish mainland had seen tests take up to five days for processing.But having the kit on-island, he said, would see results turned round in a matter of hours.Mr Robinson said he recognised there had been a #hiatus# after initial testing coronavirus had stopped.#We recognised in NHS Shetland that capacity for testing was going to be an issue. Testing in Glasgow was going from  hours to five days.#I think we recognised there was a need to get something locally.# raquoNHS Shetland, like many other essential service providers, employs people whose parents and grandparents did now grow up in Shetland, or even in the UK. Let#s allow them, women and man alike, to be fully welcomed as valued members of our communities, with equal status.Let#s make the changes needed to fully include them and their families and so appreciate the strength in ersity that is their much appreciated contribution to modern Shetland, modern Scotland and modern Britain.Peter#s choice of poetry is particularly relevant during a week when British farmers chartered planes to collect  farm workers from Romania.The manager of the airline says he has already put in a bid for the next six flights.These Romanians form the first link in a long chain that magically re-stocks our supermarket shelves while we lie sleeping in our beds every night.For those with an apatite for further contemplation, I would recommend the following article:Thanks for the helpful and interesting link Malcolm. It almost makes a case for education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!Reading it helped me to reflect on how dangerous it is for us to accept a narrow and rigid definition of what makes for a permissible #Shetlander#,and how important it is to reject the idea that some are entitled to more of a voice in that discussion than others.Those wishing to contest the need for such points to be made should first read Malcolm#s recommended article and then reflect on how recently a SMUHA squad featured a black-faced member of the NHS.As the article points out there is a prospect that this visus will not lead to more harmonious societies.The price of the peaceful cooperation we should wish for with all our neighboursis vigilance against those who would needlessly turn us against each other.Ilove how Peter and Malcolm appear to be so in veneration of each other, just a tad too preachy for me. As for #an education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!# I would respectfully suggest a basis eduction in the STEM subjects would be of far more value to humankind. That way most would understand what a virus is, how a vaccine works. The sort of simple science stuff that lives depend on.Humanities educated, Like Boris Johson and Rees Mogg. Go for it, Peter!One hesitates to perturb so a warm a socialist embrace. However, re the linked article, any author who discusses Nazism and bigotry in one breath and then Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi in the next while omitting to mention China’s Xi Jinping or the North Korean monster, Kim Jong-un, is clearly peddling a dishonest agenda.It#s a wonder people #educated in the humanities# didn#t see that. Interesting.Having installed himself as president for le, Xi is reportedly responsible for the most appalling, vicious repression and imprisonment of a million Uighur people and the relentless destruction of their culture in China’s Xinjiang province. The “ View” is clear: “Speak out or be complicit.”“Without sustained pressure, the grotesque human rights abuses seen in Xinjiang will not just continue but intensy. The time to speak up arrived long ago. Countries should be shouting about this from the rooftops.”If you want a chilling reminder of Nazism, guys, look no further.Does anyone want to remind John the NHS is socialist in intent and inception Did he learnall this from the wonderful British Empire ,I wonder, so ,he is a poor apprentice.John Tulloch#s unwillingness to engage with the main points previously made is unsurprising.Have I missed something here  An article about testing equipment arriving in Shetland allowing results to be available in hours rather than days has very quickly turned into a debate about immigrants, racism, humanities -v- STEM Education and extreme left right wing politics. It’s not always necessary to find something to disagree about.@Stephen Johnston, I agree. That#s precisely why I hadn’t commented on any coronavirus item, here or where, until my above post. The coronavirus pandemic is a rapidly unfolding tragedy, a national and global emergency. Using it as a political football is completely inappropriate.However, there comes a point when people pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, endlessly stirring the pot of social ision and bitterness, must be challenged. Ideally, we would support those faced with tackling the crisis # at all levels # and keep our criticisms constructive. Or keep quiet and let them get on with it. Lessons can be learned later, with the benefit of hindsight, once all the facts are knownAs they say, # you won#t help, at least, get out of the way.#JT, straight from the right wing playbook# Tell them to be quiet. It#s an effective way to silence people # who could disagree that the coronavirus is a terrible tragedy after all  But#JT, How is the racism suffered every day for thousands of NHS staff not up for discussion  Why do you wish to silence that discussion Why don#t you deal with issue, rather than making a series of accusations and personal attacks What facts about racism faced by NHS staff are not known  Maybe not known to you, but lived by the people in the poem. Maybe for you racism and anti-immigrant sentiment is a political football to be put away until you see fit. But for the people who have lived with it through their lives, suffered because of it, it is a matter of day to day struggle. And yes, a political issue.When John declared that “People pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments, must be challenged” I assumed that he was going to say something about Dr Mr Lt.Cdr Tinkler.For what it’s worth John, my own qualications are an HGV and PSV licence sothat’s what you regard as a superior education, you must have the mother of all inferiority complexes.Whenever anyone tries to bring up subjects like racism or social exclusion on this forum, the same few iniduals fly into an apoplectic rage and you, John, are always one of them.As someone once said:“If you won’t help, at least, get out of the way.”Malcolm Henry Johnson, O dear me, that chip on the shoulder. It was actually Surgeon Lieutenant Commander with  years training in Nuclear, Biological and ChemicalWarfare including triage and casualty care. I rejoice I never had time to waste on the humanities, more important work to do, like keeping people breathing.I know, tell me about it Ian. I for one would be fine without HGV drivers. In fact, I have been training our blessed grandson on how to handle a mule and cart . On a side note, I was exposed to radiation as a child in the s. The triage nurse was excellent and the radiation never did me any harm. So what I am saying is you are both valued by old John Thomas.I’ve often pondered the nature of predictability and wondered: What came first, the Surgeon Lieutenant Commander or the wind-up, clockwork toy To Peter Hamilton and John Thomas I say, thank you, for exemplying my point about using the coronavirus tragedy as a political football. Perfect.I hadn#t commented about NHS or care home staff. However, relatives of mine are currently benefitting from their work and their courage and conviction is truly admirable. Whatever their race or nationality, I heartily applaud it.Call me what you like. I won#t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic#Punch and Judy# food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. I invite readers to check my above points and judge for themselves.Have a nice day, boys.JT:#I won’t be drawn into an unseemly, polemic “Punch and Judy” food fight over the crisis by personal attacks. ##pompously touting their supposedly superior educations to bolster bogus arguments,#Pot meet kettle.

I cannot be relied upon for sensible or relevant debate. That much should be clear by now.Yes Laurence, I think I got that. It will be interesting to see what this week#s Sunday Times has in store for Boris.I don’t read the Sunday Times Petrus, but I can tell you that there is a seat in the hall of linguistic fame for Johnson. He has given rise to a new noun: boris. It replaces an eight-letter, rather rude one, that begins with a “d “and ends with a “d”. Suggested usage: Don’t be a boris, stay safe, stay well.Carrie Symonds!! Love you Peter, such a star.Love you too Ian, good to see you, evenonly virtually while the lockdown is on.Not normally a fan myself Rosa, of The Sunday Times, but the  days Boris wasted got full front page coverage on the th. This means, for the purists, that the above good news story could have come a lot earlier.The increasingly tragic outcome, the delay and the ideology of this government of disaster capitalists are all directly linked.As for an eight letter word to describe superspreader Johnson, well frankly Rosa, I am at a loss. It is a letter short, but maybe #dullard# It would probably take someone with proper scientic training to know for sure.Led by the scientists indeed.Meanwhile, for those with a rudimentaryappreciation for creativity and the arts, I will offer the following, with an apology to those readers with more refined sensibilities: Ours us but to clap and cry..."},{"url":null,"title":"seafood industry support welcomed by sfa ","story":"Shetland Fishermen#s Associationhas welcomed additional Scottish government support for #one of the most beleaguered segments of Scotland#s fishing industry#.The SFA also warned that seafood businesses should not be allowed to fail because of Covid-.A further £.m to help large sea fishing vessels was announced by the Scottish government on Friday, bringing seafood industry support to £.m.The latest scheme provides capped payments of up to £, per vessel to businesses with a vessel over  metres landing shellfish such as crab, lobster, scallop and langoustine # to help them meet fixed costs like insurance.

I started counting them and by the time we reached the island, over  planes had flown across, each leaving a mark in the sky.The clear blue became hazy, and the afternoon never ed to the clarity of when we began our walk.These days in lockdown, as we experience this incredible weather we have the clarity which was lost that day.With few or no airliners flying over, the atmosphere seems sharper, brighter, and maybe pollution from industrial parts spreads worldwide and in the past, found its way over to us via jet streams and high air currents.This pollution seems now much reduced.The talk now is of exit strategies and how we end this lockdown. The term “other side” has been coined and was even used in last week’s very moving front page editorial.What will the other side look like There will be many in tough situations during lock down, and for many more the future will be uncertain, and much of the stress from that uncertainty will probably revolve around financial security.A new normal will have to emerge, and we might hope that it will be more sustainable, on all fronts, both locally and globally.Some say that it was Steve Jobs of Apple computers who turned wants into needs, and empires have been built in our commercial world by making desires into needs.There seem to be business models which require constant expansion or ‘biggering’, to use a phrase from the well-known Dr Suess’ children’s book ‘The Lorax’, which is warning of the consequence of continual industrial growth.It is always worth looking at nature, even when thinking of economy and industry.Diversity is healthy in the natural world, a healthy ecosystem has an element of sustainability, but within that system, things grow and die, and more importantly are eaten, nothing is wasted.Businesses will come and go, but the reliance on a single sector for a whole community could never be healthy.The tourists are unlikely to visit Skye in the numbers they have in the last few years, and perhaps never will again.There will be no ‘go’ button pressed after lock-down, and even next season is likely to be considerably quieter. We will have to learn to exist with the reduced numbers.There is risk in business, such is the way of it, and I suspect there was a perception that investing in tourism on Skye was a fairly reliable bet.Investing to meet the seemingly never-ending demand was something even banks might have been comfortable with. Looking back at the tourist season last year, maybe it just could not have continued growing and growing.Something had to give, it is just that nobody could have envisaged such a collapse, and for such a reason.Many of us are guilty of chasing the dollar, but is it for the dollars sake, is it for needs or wants, and what do we lose in the quest I used to joke about retiring to the city “where the pace of le is slower”. The cliché of getting a work le balance sorted is never more relevant.On my few travels into Portree, I have seen parents playing football with their children in their gardens. I have seen family groups taking their daily exercise, one group having a picnic on a small cnoc above the road, being together, enjoying time together.I have seen on social media, electricians proudly showing off their first loaf of bread, and a joiner with his first batch of home brew bottled. Is this reluctantly filling in time before we go back to normal, or is it learning new behaviours, new ways of being.Of course, we need the security of paying the mortgage, feeding our families, paying bills, but what are our real needs, and what have we been coerced into thinking we need During this lockdown, whilst we might have no income, many of us have been gted that incredibly precious commodity # time.As the air gets clearer, I would hope that as iniduals, communities and a wider society, we can take this opportunity to re-evaluate what is essential, what it is we need.We should look at our lives with the polished unpolluted lens of this lockdown period at what our values and real requirements are and decide what should be on the other side.I have sat on those planes that fly over, but the stars last night were simply stunning after the evening light had turned from orange to deep, deep blue.I think we need clarity on the other sideThe West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/20200426_082047.jpg","title":"new gaelic website for the youngest","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWith nurseries closed, a new resource aimed at teaching Gaelic to pre-school learners has been launched early.#Gàidhlig nan Òg# was due to have been launched in August  but has been brought forward to help the home-learning community..Maree Todd, Minister for Children and Young People, said: “This website for young Gaelic learners is packed with songs, rhymes and activities and will provide vital support for Gaelic learning in early years.#It will provide hours of fun and learning and will give young people an excellent start on the road to fluency in the Gaelic language.”The resource aims to provide parents carers and early years practitioners with an abundance of themed resources to help the acquisition of Gaelic in pre-school children.Gàidhlig nan Òg features a series of presentations to teach words and phrases plus supporting soundfiles, illustrations, songs, stories and activities, matched to three stages of language progression.A guidance document with suggestions on how best to use the resource is included.Shona MacLennan, Ceannard Bòrd na Gàidhlig, said: “We recognise the crucial role of families in bringing up new Gaelic speakers, and we are delighted that this fantastic resource will support them to do that at home, particularly during this time.#Credit too must be given to the early years workers who provide support through creative ways of engaging youngsters at home.”Although aimed at early years practitioners for their day-to-day interactions with children aged -, Gàidhlig nan Òg will also support adult learners.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/calmac-pic.jpg","title":"island ferry restrictions could stay in place after wider lockdown is","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineTravel restrictions on island ferries could be lted at a separate – and potentially later date – than wider lockdown measures, it has been suggested.Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan said he had urged the Scottish Government to make sure changes come at a time that is “informed by local factors”.His comments come after the Scottish Government published a new paper setting out very tentative steps towards a gradual easing of the current lockdown restrictions.Dr Allan said new ways of living – effectively a “new normal” – may have to be in place for some time to come.Travel to and from the Western Isles is currently restricted to islanders and essential workers only, with CalMac now taking less than one per cent of the passengers they were taking at this time last year.Dr Allan said that while lockdown restrictions have been dficult– not least for tourism businesses # they had helped to save lives and protect the NHS.He added: “It is vital that any decision to ease restrictions is based on the best scientic advice possible. However, this is a constantly-changing situation and there may be a need to reapply restrictions after they are lted.#It is only when we are sure the virus is under control that we can even start to ease any of the restrictions because the virus will not have gone away.“The virus is progressing at dferent rates around dferent parts of the country. We have thankfully not had any fatalities in the Western Isles and it has been some time since new cases of infection have been reported.“I am really grateful that so many islanders have been earnestly sticking to the social distancing guidance: this has undoubtedly kept infection rates down and helped ease the burden on the NHS. “I know that the talk of lting lockdown has a lot of people concerned about the prospect of an influx of people from areas of the country heavily affected by Coronavirus.#I certainly don’t want to see this, and I think we should all be prepared for the travel restrictions to the islands to be in place for the foreseeable future – eventhat means restrictions staying in place after lockdown across the rest of the country has been lted.”Last week Dr Allan – responding to a proposal for the islands to become ‘testbeds’ for easing lockdown – said there was a case to be made for a regional approach.However, he warned of obvious dangersthe islands became “subject to an influx of travellers from other areas where the virus has peaked.”Meanwhile, Highlands and Islands Tory MSP Donald Cameron urged local people “not to relax” their vigilance and to maintain social distancing.He said: “We must remember that vulnerable members of our community are relying on us to maintain strict discipline.

You can still get outside, you can go for a run, you can do ious forms of exercise that I just couldn#t do in Antarctica so in many ways it#s easier.When we were in Antarctica it was  days before two of us left the island for the first time.He added: There are more opportunities here at home - you can go for a run or a cycle. I suppose it#s what you make of it, really.Although Kit, who has a Master#s degree in polar and alpine change, initially said it would be tough to single out the best bit of his Antarctic adventure, he subsequently revealed one special memory which will be hard to surpass.We got to kayak around the island on Christmas Day which was pretty special, he said.It meant that we could see the island from a dferent perspective.Recalling a December  like no other during his stint at the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust#s post office, Kit said he did not even miss not getting the usual turkey dinner.There was a little bit of snow on Christmas morning, then it cleared and it was a real blue sky day, he said. We started cooking the Christmas dinner and we had an offer to borrow kayaks from a ship that was in the area so we borrowed those, put the Christmas cooking on hold, left it on the hob and went kayaking around the island.Not many people ever get up close and personal to the penguin population, but Kit can now be counted among their number.The chicks are inquisitive and would go into buildingsyou left doors open too long, he said.Some of the adults are a bit less friendly, and more protective. But they#re fantastically funny to watch I don#t think you could ever get bored watching them and we were literally surrounded by them the whole time.Four months in one of the world#s most remote locations must be hard to follow. Asked what#s next on the agenda, Kit replied: I really don#t know.You can have all these grand plans and ideas and then a virus throws a spanner in the works.I wanted to see some places that I#d never been before. Now I#m sorting through photographs from being away.Kit said he would love to go back to what must be one of the coolest destinations he has ever visited.We#ll see how thing span out for next November, he mused.The trust has said they#ll be choosing people who#ve been before to go back ... so I#ll possibly throw my hat into the ring.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Jake burst into tears, I burst into tears! I hugged our surrogate and told her that words couldn#t express how grateful we were to her. Then I looked at Millie and thought: #Oh my God. This is my baby!# My brain did not compute it immediately.The couple#s journey to parenthood was not easy.Actor, writer and director Jakestarted gender reassignment in his late s.Hannah, who was awarded an MBE last year, came out as a trans woman in , having reached the rank of Captain in the British Army. After leaving the military in  Hannah now works in finance.Baby Millie is genetically related to Jake from eggs he harvested when he stopped taking testosterone a number of years ago in the hope that one day he would become a parent.The eggs were fertilised with sperm from an anonymous donor, and the embryos were stored for five years.By then Jake and Hannah had met, and after marrying in  the embryo was implanted last year in a surrogate found through the National Fertility Society.Now based temporarily in an Airbnb in Northern Ireland, where they have been for the past month having arrived just before the travel ban, the couple are waiting for documentation that will allow them to travel back home to London.We thought we#d prepared for everything, even the unlikely event that we#d both die, but we hadn#t prepared for a pandemic, Jake said.In fact, the couple had just ed home from a trip to the US when they made the decision to come to Northern Ireland to make sure they were there in time for their daughter#s arrival.After a ferry across the Irish Sea, taking precautions to ensure they didn#t pick up the Covid- virus, the couple were in situ by the baby#s due date of Easter Sunday.Their unnamed surrogate was induced on Easter Sunday, and baby Millie arrived weighing lbs oz on the Tuesday.Jake and Hannah said they will keep in touch with their surrogate in the future, but for now they can#t wait to get home and introduce the new addition to the rest of their family.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The fact that young children may be unable to describe other, less obvious symptoms can make the start of a cough even more worrying.But a cough doesn#t necessarily mean Covid-, of course. As well as being caused by other less serious respiratory illnesses such as a cold, a cough may be caused by asthma, which is diagnosed in around one in  children and, unlike other lung diseases, has a far higher incidence in children than in adults.But, as World Asthma Dayapproaches, how can you tell the dference between an asthma cough and a coronavirus cough  Here, the experts answer questions about spotting the dference.My child has started coughing - what should I do GP and respiratory expert Dr Noel Baxter, medical adviser at Asthma UK, says: If your child has a new cough or their cough is getting worse, you should contact your GP to get the right advice and find out what to do next. You shouldn#t try to diagnose your child on your own.What are the main dferences between an asthma cough and a Covid- one The Asthma Society of Irelandsays: The respiratory symptoms associated with Covid- are similar to asthma - shortness of breath, and cough. The symptom which dferentiates asthma from Covid- is experiencing a new fever. Fever is the symptom that has been most common of any symptom in confirmed cases of Covid-.Baxter adds: Are other people in the home having temperatures and coughs  This could be Covid-, but remember this could also be other bacterial or viral infections of the respiratory system that are still around at this time of year.If your child is having a cough because of asthma, they may also be wheezing. This is a faint whistling sound that comes from your child#s chest. The cough will tend to be dry with sometimes a small amount of pale yellow phlegm.My child already has asthma - how do I tellit#s causing her cough Baxter advises parents to look at their child#s written personal asthma action plan, made with their health care professional.This will refresh your memory about what your child#s asthma symptoms are normally like, he says.This is by far the best place to start. After the pandemic, this asthma action plan will continue to help you and your child whenever they get respiratory symptoms in the future.Covid-, just like any other winter cold virus, can trigger an asthma attack. This would be the most likely impact of Covid- in a child with asthma. That#s good news because we have rapidly effective treatments for an asthma attack, which will be detailed in your asthma action plan.Although this is less common, your child may have a cough because the Covid- virus has caused an airways infection, which includes the more serious situation of pneumonia. So, it#s possible to have an asthma cough and a Covid- cough at the same time.What normally triggers your child#s cough Baxter says parents of children who already have asthma should ascertain whether the child has been exposed to any of their usual asthma triggers.For example, did the cough start after walking through the park where the grass has just been mown, he asks.Are they being more exposed than usual to the air freshener in your home  Have they been stroking a cat  If the cough seems to be linked to any of their usual triggers, it#s more likely to be asthma.What does your child#s cough sound like It#s not easy for doctors to tell what#s causing a cough just by its sound.There are a few situations where we can, such as croup, which sounds like a loud barking noise. While doctors might get some clues, it#s quite hard to tell what#s causing the cough just by sound, explains Baxter.How long have they had the cough for Asthma coughs may develop over weeks, whereas with Covid-, the cough starts and gets worse in hours or days, not weeks, says Baxter. If your child has had an asthma attack before, you will probably remember that the cough tends to be worse in the morning and at night, he adds. This iation depending on the time of day is quite common with asthma. You wouldn#t expect this with the Covid- cough as much.What should I doI think my child#s cough is asthma Make an appointment with your GP. Also try to keep a diary of their symptoms and take it to the appointment, advises Baxter.Getting a confirmed asthma diagnosis for your child can be worrying for many parents, he adds. But your doctor will give you a personal action plan for your child. If your child takes their medicines regularly, goes for asthma reviews and uses the correct inhaler technique, they and you can feel confident that having asthma won#t hold them back from doing anything.Remember,your child is coughing or their asthma symptoms are worsening, make an urgent appointment to talk to your GP. Getting their symptoms under control cuts the risk of an asthma attack.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Council members and senior management have been meeting regularly to review impacts on Council services, with daily updates on the changing response to the COVID- situation. It was decided that given the ongoing situation and all the guidance from health authorities regarding public safety and the restrictions regarding public gatherings it would be prudent to cancel at this stage.Announcing the decision, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, said it was necessary to look ahead and be realistic about what events can safely be delivered over the coming months. I know this will be disappointing as these are both popular events and ones which positively promote health, wellbeing and fitness, she declared.But these are exceptional times and dficult decisions must be made for the greater good.Local people have been responding well to the social distancing advice and I know people will understand that under the current government guidelines regarding public gatherings, it would not be possible to host these events without making major changes to their format that would have a detrimental impact.By making these decisions at an early stage, we can avoid accumulating unnecessary costs and resourcing in terms of planning, and we will continue to review other major Council-led events over the coming weeks.We do however want to send out a strong message regarding exercise and its importance to both mental and physical health at this time. Council is promoting smaller exercise challenges – such as the Family Home k Run Walk on May  – and the online Friday Fitness Challenge, which people can do at home, in their garden or near their home. We will continue to explore other activities and programmes in the coming weeks which will enhance health and wellbeing and offer people the chance to exercise in a safe and fun way.Please take the opportunity to get together as a family and enjoy games and activities, and the extra time we are getting to spend with loved ones.The decision was taken by members during a virtual meeting this week where they were reminded that regulations set out by the Department of Health in their Coronavirus Legislation which came into operation on March  were still in place.The announcement follows on from the decision to cancel the City of Derry Jazz Festival and St Patricks Day programme in recent weeks. Council will continue to adhere to the requirements to keep premises and businesses closed, including burial grounds and cemeteries, and to adhere to the restrictions on movement and gatherings. However, it continues to explore alternative options for the public including the launch this week of an online Jazz Festival. The Virtual Jazz Festival… Sofa Sessions will be broadcast as a live event on the City of Derry Jazz Festival Facebook each day from Thursday May thto Sunday May th- called the Virtual Jazz Festival…Sofa Sessions.For more information on all the impacts on Council services in relation to COVID- please go to www derrystrabane  coronavirus googletag.cmd.push  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

First Minister Arlene Foster said the collective effort is ‘far from over’. Northern Ireland is still in a ‘critical moment’ during the first wave of the pandemic, she explained, and with one misstep the country faces the prospect of the virus reproduction rate going back above one – increasing the spread. She added: “Now is not the time for government and businesses to gamble with peoples’ lives, we need to proceed cautiously and ensure that we’re doing everything we can to prevent another spike from occurring.” googletag.cmd.push Governments around the world are ‘wrestling’ with the dilemma of ‘when is the right time to lt restrictions’, she said. The press conference heard that the decision to open cemeteries was criteria led and based on scientic advice. “The Executive will continue that on every decision we reach relating to COVID- but you also, the greater Northern Ireland community, have a role to play,” the DUP leader said. She acknowledged efforts made by the public through social distancing and isolation and recognised that people want to leave the confines of their homes. But added: “Now is not the time for impatience to get the better of us. No-one should act ascoronavirus has been beaten, it hasn’t, and we still have some way to go. googletag.cmd.push “If people go back to gathering in large numbers in public spaces andthey do not listen to the guidance on social distancing then they run the risk of another spike. “Having come so far in containing this disease it would be more than just a crying shame to undo that collective effort, it would be catastrophic for families, for communities and for a society as small as Northern Ireland’s.” The DUP leader referred to the speech made by Boris Johnson this morning when he said that thought must be given to ‘relaxation’, the path plotted carefully andthe government moves too fast it may be forced to ‘slam on the brakes’ again. Arelene Foster said: “That’s not what we want to do and we can’t afford to get too far ahead of ourselves.” She reiterated the point that the government would be led by scientic and medical advice and urged people to stay at home when possible. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said it is ‘disappointing’ to hear reports that some people have decided to relax restrictions themselves. “That kind of attitude is wrong, it is reckless and it is endangering live. Until a vaccine is found it means that we must co-exist with this virus. “And that means a radical change to how we live our daily lives for some time. For the most part people have been making personal sacrices for that greater good. And thank you for that. “But we must keep going, we must save lives. There is light at the end of the tunnel, there certainly is light, but we need to keep doing what we’re doing now in order to save lives and help our healthcare staff cope in our healthcare system.” She praised the public and health workers and welcomed news of pound.m of additional support for care homes which will help with additional staff to care for those in isolation and enhanced cleaning. LOCKDOWN Restrictions will be reviewed up until May  but Arlene Foster again asked people to be patient. In terms of contact tracing, a pilot is starting here this week and an App is being developed. Meanwhile, Michelle O’Neill welcomed the British government stance, ‘albeit late’, of test, trace isolate - a policy endorsed by the World Health Organisation . “The countries which have been most effective are those that have moved on this very quickly. “Contact tracing needs to be rolled out right across the community because that is part of our success in being able to counter the position that we could find ourselves in later where,you’re facing a second wave of this, that our ability to stop that will come down to how effective we are in contact tracing,” Sinn Feacutein’s Vice President added. She encouraged people to ‘keep doing what we’re doing’ as it has ‘proven effective’. DEATH TOLL Michelle O’Neill gave a figure of  deaths -  announced in total by the Public Health Agencybased on figures provided by health trusts – but said NISRA statistics would bring it up to . When questioned about Sinn Feacutein leader Mary Lou McDonald’s comments that the pandemic is an ‘accelerant’ for a united Ireland, Ms O’Neill said an all-island approach to health ‘makes sense’ and is not a political point. “We live on an island and it’s a natural advantage so it’s important we use that.” While Ms Foster said her priority is saving lives and it’s ‘regrettable’ that other leaders are ‘naval gazing’ at this time. The southern government is planning to publish a report outlining a strategy for the easing of restrictions. When probed about Northern Ireland’s own lockdown exit strategy the First Minister did not indicatethat would happen in the North or indeed provide any timeframe. Michelle O’Neill added that talk of relaxation feeds into public discourse before reinforcing the government’s key message for people to stay at home.

First Minister Arlene Foster said the collective effort is ‘far from over’. Northern Ireland is still in a ‘critical moment’ during the first wave of the pandemic, she explained, and with one misstep the country faces the prospect of the virus reproduction rate going back above one – increasing the spread. She added: “Now is not the time for government and businesses to gamble with peoples’ lives, we need to proceed cautiously and ensure that we’re doing everything we can to prevent another spike from occurring.” googletag.cmd.push Governments around the world are ‘wrestling’ with the dilemma of ‘when is the right time to lt restrictions’, she said. The press conference heard that the decision to open cemeteries was criteria led and based on scientic advice. “The Executive will continue that on every decision we reach relating to COVID- but you also, the greater Northern Ireland community, have a role to play,” the DUP leader said. She acknowledged efforts made by the public through social distancing and isolation and recognised that people want to leave the confines of their homes. But added: “Now is not the time for impatience to get the better of us. No-one should act ascoronavirus has been beaten, it hasn’t, and we still have some way to go. googletag.cmd.push “If people go back to gathering in large numbers in public spaces andthey do not listen to the guidance on social distancing then they run the risk of another spike. “Having come so far in containing this disease it would be more than just a crying shame to undo that collective effort, it would be catastrophic for families, for communities and for a society as small as Northern Ireland’s.” The DUP leader referred to the speech made by Boris Johnson this morning when he said that thought must be given to ‘relaxation’, the path plotted carefully andthe government moves too fast it may be forced to ‘slam on the brakes’ again. Arelene Foster said: “That’s not what we want to do and we can’t afford to get too far ahead of ourselves.” She reiterated the point that the government would be led by scientic and medical advice and urged people to stay at home when possible. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said it is ‘disappointing’ to hear reports that some people have decided to relax restrictions themselves. “That kind of attitude is wrong, it is reckless and it is endangering live. Until a vaccine is found it means that we must co-exist with this virus. “And that means a radical change to how we live our daily lives for some time. For the most part people have been making personal sacrices for that greater good. And thank you for that. “But we must keep going, we must save lives. There is light at the end of the tunnel, there certainly is light, but we need to keep doing what we’re doing now in order to save lives and help our healthcare staff cope in our healthcare system.” She praised the public and health workers and welcomed news of pound.m of additional support for care homes which will help with additional staff to care for those in isolation and enhanced cleaning. LOCKDOWN Restrictions will be reviewed up until May  but Arlene Foster again asked people to be patient. In terms of contact tracing, a pilot is starting here this week and an App is being developed. Meanwhile, Michelle O’Neill welcomed the British government stance, ‘albeit late’, of test, trace isolate - a policy endorsed by the World Health Organisation . “The countries which have been most effective are those that have moved on this very quickly. “Contact tracing needs to be rolled out right across the community because that is part of our success in being able to counter the position that we could find ourselves in later where,you’re facing a second wave of this, that our ability to stop that will come down to how effective we are in contact tracing,” Sinn Feacutein’s Vice President added. She encouraged people to ‘keep doing what we’re doing’ as it has ‘proven effective’. DEATH TOLL Michelle O’Neill gave a figure of  deaths -  announced in total by the Public Health Agencybased on figures provided by health trusts – but said NISRA statistics would bring it up to . When questioned about Sinn Feacutein leader Mary Lou McDonald’s comments that the pandemic is an ‘accelerant’ for a united Ireland, Ms O’Neill said an all-island approach to health ‘makes sense’ and is not a political point. “We live on an island and it’s a natural advantage so it’s important we use that.” While Ms Foster said her priority is saving lives and it’s ‘regrettable’ that other leaders are ‘naval gazing’ at this time. The southern government is planning to publish a report outlining a strategy for the easing of restrictions. When probed about Northern Ireland’s own lockdown exit strategy the First Minister did not indicatethat would happen in the North or indeed provide any timeframe. Michelle O’Neill added that talk of relaxation feeds into public discourse before reinforcing the government’s key message for people to stay at home.

Fireside selectors picking teams is one of Ireland’s national past times. This selection is based on players who took part in county senior, intermediate and junior finals -. It is based on the grade they were playing at that time. Five from each is selected. Just like putting five litres into a one litre jar. Here goes...  - Antoacutein McMullan For years it was the ‘big boot’ in defence who would do the kicking out. Distance was important. Now it has developed into an art form with the qualities being, a cool head, the ability to kick the ball through basketball hoop at a distance of  metres, safe hands and cat like reflexesrequired. Antoacutein has all the credentials. googletag.cmd.push  - Oisin Duffy A good defender is one that the forward hates playing against and the energetic Duffy was one of those prize assets. Firm in the tackle, virtually impossible to stop on the run and full of scores from his defensive position. His display in the Ulster Intermediate championship against Magheracloone, where he scored - from play, was exceptional.  - Brendan Rogers No player can change gear as quickly as the tall Brendan when he motors out of defence. He would excel in any sport and could play anywhere on the football field. A brilliant hurler as well. Seeing a forward chasing him with tongue hanging out is something were are used to. A real pleasure to watch. googletag.cmd.push  - Karl McKaigueThere is a famous film called the Quiet Man. Karl could be titled the quiet marker in defence. He has snuffed out some of the best forwards in the game and still manages to slip forward and get a point or two. Tackles the ball and not the man, so he rarely gives away frees. His anticipation of where the ball is going to drop is exceptional.  - Niall KeenanA neat and tidy footballer. His build would suggest corner forward material but he is actually a quality defender. Came through the minor and U ranks showing class all the way. His display at Croke Park in the  minor semi-final for Derry marked him as a player with a great future and he has lived up to that billing.  - Joe Gray Play anywhere Joewas the heart beat of Faughanvale teams for the most of two decades. He led a young team from the junior ranks to a solid intermediate outfit. Played and managed at dferent times and had a few games with Derry in the s. Has all the skills and a read dead eye free taker.  - Jimmy O’Connor Jimmy was ‘spotted’ by an Derry U scout when he was closer to  than . Now, nearer  than , he keeps up an amazing standard of fitness. Normally listed as a corner forward he is let loose to conduce the orchestra. Not the biggest but he makes light of that with his wide range of skills.  - Enda Muldoon Could have played on any team, in any era. Great hands and a master of the ever accurate foot pass. Always made the game look easy since he broke into a Derry minor team in . Now a qualied coach, passing on his skills to the next generation the youngsters could not have had a better tutor. A gentleman on and off the field.  - Mark Lynch From enthralling Croke Park in the  All-Ireland minor final, at the age of , Mark has continued to show quality. Stepped down two years ago after a long inter county career. Still the heart and soul of Banagher teams. He was exceptional in their senior championship run last year and the intermediate title a year previous. In his all round skills is the mastery of free taking.  - Michael McNaughtGrandson of the great Mickey McNaught who was on the Derry  National League winning team. His accurate left foot is one of the reasons why the Waterside men have become a solid force in Derry football. Can play midfield or half forward and seldom is below par. A very accurate free taker.  - Richard KingRichard broke into the Wolfhound’s senior team at the age of  as a corner forward. Now a commanding figure in the half forward line and an excellent free taker. Was a key figure in the treble winning junior team of . His rather harsh sending off against Red Hugh’s almost certainly cost Limavady the Ulster title. At  there is a lot more to come from this excellent footballer  - Enda Lynn Good enough to captain his county for two seasons. This man is a virtual scoring machine. Such is his dedication that he has been known to train on Christmas Day. His pace and tireless running makes him nearly impossible to mark. Missed a lot of action last season with an injury. Greenlough and Derry will be glad to see him back againthe action ever resumes.  - Paudie O’Neill Probably the best club footballer in Derry never to get a county call. Time after time, he would win games on his own for the Henry Joys. His scoring tallies were mind boggling but like a lot of good footballer had ongoing injury problems. A loyal club player he often played through the pain barrier.  - Kevin O’ConnorEvery year he postpones his retirement is another good year for Foreglen. From being an excellent half forward he now brings his deadly accuracy to the role of target man. A quite superb free taker who is always calm and measured. Played a leading role in their intermediate championship win last season.  - Conleith Gilligan Has to be one of the highest ever scorers in Derry club football. From his teenage years to his mid-s his quality never dimmed. Be it from frees or open play, he seldom missed the target. His pace and ability to be in the right place at the right time marked him as one of the best. His retirement left a huge void in the Shamrock’s attack. He is now passing on his skills to others.

He was impressionable. In September, he was listening intently to the wireless, as Derry launched their first bid for Sam Maguire. He wasnt just reliant on the radio waves to savour the magic. Twice a week, the Derry team would train in nearby Newbridge and he got to meet his heroes. Where the towns Credit Union now resides, John Joe Diamonds cafe was located on Bellaghys Castle Street. Tommy, now  years of age, vividly remembers the scene as his mother Cathy made plates of sandwiches for the players before they ed home, to the four corners of the county. googletag.cmd.push “When you get the county stars in your kitchen twice a week, I got to know them all well and I was friendly with them through the years,” Diamond begins. Sean OConnell would later train the Derry teams that Diamond would captain to All-Ireland glory. “I played with him too, hiscareer lasted a brave while...he mustve been  when he was still playing with Derry,” Diamond adds. When Bellaghy All-Ireland winning manager Harry Cassidy took charge at county level, he called Diamond into the senior  in the early s. He was part of the team that toured New York and Connecticut. googletag.cmd.push “We went out to play exhibition matches out there. It was an experience to get out there. We also won the Wembley Tournament two years in a row.” The semi-finals were played in the iconic stadium, with the final played out in New Eltham. “I was taking a look the other day and I think I have played in every county in Ireland,” Diamond added, of a county career that ended in . But it was the s, when he left his greatest imprint. *** In , Tommy was on Bellaghys first county U championship winning team and was a minor champion three years later. At county level, Derry minors had yet to reach an Ulster final. The first of Diamonds three years in the county minor team began in the closing stages of a game in Dungiven, with Antrim in the lead. “I remember being threw on as a late sub and two balls were kicked right over the full-back,” he recalls. “They landed in my hands and all I had to do was to kick them into the net and I think we won by a point.” After another season of consolidation, a place in the final again eluded them, but there was a crux of a team still eligible for . “We knew from , we had a good  and we didnt lose many,” said Diamond, who was made captain. When Derry defeated Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh on their way to the  minor league final, they did so without the St Columbs Derry players who focussed on winning the MacRory and Hogan Cups, under the management of former Fermanagh player Fr Ignatius McQuillan, just four years after tiptoeing onto the Ulster Colleges scene. “Then seven or eight of them came onto the Derryteam – which was some help,” Diamond added. “FrShields was the man who put the backbone into us and Sean , he put all the final touches to us, he was a great trainer.  Sean OConnell, Tommy Diamond and Fr Seamus Shields with the Tom Markham Cup “We trained twice a week up in Ballinascreen and after training we went into Timoneys for sandwiches and milk every night.” Aside from the medals and success, Diamond is grateful for the memories and friendships built up, that stood the test of time. “If any of us ever meet each other, it is a half day session. Thats the great thing about it.” They hammered Donegal in the  first round, in Dungiven, but the win came at a cost with a knee injury to Chris Brown. In the semi-final it was a dferent story and it was a narrow - to - win over Down, a game that saw Phil Friel sustain three fractured ribs. “We beat Cavan in the final in Clones,” Diamond remembers. “It was a hard, dour match and a typical Cavan match with hard hitting and not a lot of finesse about it.” Derry were Ulster champions and with the Hogan Cup now in the county, there was an air of quiet confidence as the squad headed to Croke Park. Diamonds first memory of their epic semi-final with Roscommon was giving the referee his name. “I was marking Dermot Early that day and we got booked after  seconds,” he laughs. “It was some start to a semi-final. I caught the ball and as soon as I caught the ball, he hit me. He was about two seconds late, I hit him with an upper cut and put him on the broad of his back and both of us were booked.” Derry were - to - winners and with the game in the melting pot in the second half, Early pulled a penalty wide of the posts when the Rossies were four points in arrears. “The great Miacutecheaacutel Oacute Muircheartaigh was commenting and he called it the game of the golden goals. Every one of them was hit in from  yards, absolute screamers.” It was time for one last push. Derry had one hand on the Tom Markham Cup. So too had Kerry. *** The Kingdom had the breeze and thanks to some wastefulness in Derrys attack, Kerry were a point ahead at the break. Sean OConnells pep talk worked wonders and the cogs began to turn. Tommy Diamond and Seamus Lagans performance at midfield helped them to a - to - win. “I dont remember an awful about it.” Diamond says. Earlier in the day, GAA President Alf Murray asked himhad his speech prepared with the customary lines of Irish, should Derry win. “I had no Irish, so he penned out the speech with the phonetics and I tucked it into the pocket of my shorts”. The speech mustve slipped out during the game and as he stood on the presentation podium, Diamonds pocket was empty. “I am the first man to just speak in English, I dont think it went down to well but I just had to go ahead with it,” he continued. The team stayed out in Portmarnock on the Saturday and Sunday night. Just recently Donal Mullan, son of county official at the time Paddy, handed Diamond a ticket from the post-final banquet. “The entrance admission was just  shillings,” he added. The homecoming on the Monday took nearly six hours, with crowds coming out along the route to salute the new champions. There were bonfires as the team crossed the county border. On the final leg of the journey, the victory cavalcade of cars coming to Maghera streamed all the way back to Tobermore. The Brackaghreilly Pipe band led John Mulhollands decorated lorry up Maghera street. “I remember being up on the top of the cab. They had a seat and I was tied into it and held the cup,” Diamond proudly beams. “It was some occasion for the firstchampionship to come into Derry.” Two years later, with Diamond still as captain, Derry won the Ulster U title before getting trounced by Mayo in the All-Ireland semi-final in Charlestown. “We were favourites for Ulster but we just werent ready for it ,” Diamond admits. “We were a year young and the next year we were all U and Sean OConnell was still in charge of us.” In , Derry swept all before them in Ulster, with only Down putting up any sort of resistance and Seamus McCloskeys - tally was enough to see off Monaghan in the final. Kerry came to Ballinascreen for the semi-final and trailed - to - at half-time, but had pegged the team back to a point midway through the second half. Diamond was switched to mark Brendan Lynch and a Kevin Teague goal helped swing the game in the home sides favour. Holders Mayo were shocked by Offaly in the other semi-final, setting up a Croke Park meeting with Derry. The Oaks led by nine points at the interval with the Faithful County down to -men after the dismissal of Eugene Mulligan, before easing to victory. He was the first player to captain his county to minor and U All-Ireland titles. But for Diamond,  was far from over. Despite playing three years for Derry minors, it took Diamond time to break into the Bellaghy senior team who would win seven titles during the s. He was dismissed, along with his brother Laurence, in the  semi-final win over Kilrea and missed the final. “Bellaghy had a strong  of players,” Diamond points out. “I only got my place on the senior team when Anthony Madden went to Australia and I got his place at right corner back.” There was nothing  only football and it is still the case. Karls son James is the first of his grandsons to play senior championship for the blues. The recent underage production line represents the hope in the new batch in the club. “They have the greatest facilities and have everything you would want and we have no team,” Diamond adds, referring to the -year gap since the John McLaughlin Cup rested in Bellaghy. “At that timewe had no facilities but we had teams....its a change of circumstances.” He picked up the third of eight senior medals in , but the Bellaghy adventure was only beginning. Once again, Diamond was involved in a first as the club were crowned Ulster champions in the first year of the competition. Frankie OLoane scored - in a  point win over Pearses of Belfast in the first round and it was followed up by a victory over a Newry Mitchells side that hammered Bryansford in the Down decider, thanks to goals from Sean Lee and Tom Scullion. Bellaghy beat St Josephs in the final, a combination of Ballyshannon and Bundoran, played on December  in the falling snow. “They had Brian McEnf and about  county men in total. They had a strong side and they actually, by right, shouldve beat us, but we were that dogged that day,” Diamond states. “It was a really cold day and we got a bit of a lead up against them. It was a rearguard action against the breeze in the second half but we held out.” There was no All-Ireland series until  when East Kerry won the title. Bellaghy retained their Derry title with a win over Slaughtneil in  before losing the final the following year to Newbridge. When they bounced back, it took them to their finest hour. A - to - win over Lavey saw them win Derry title number . In Ulster, they defeated Ballybofey, Ardboe and Teemore before taking on Armaghs Clann na nGael in the Ulster final. A - to - interval lead put them on their way to a facile win. In the All-Ireland series, it was a dferent story and Frankie OLoane was twice their savour. Tommy Diamond, Hugh McGoldrick and Chris Brown led from the half-back line against Portlaoise, but it was OLoane who tied the game late on, before Hugh Donnelly scored the winner in a - to - win. In the final, they took on the might of UCC and once again it took OLoane, with his seventh point of the game, to level matters late on. When Hugh McGoldrick broke up a Cork attack, Brendan Cassidy went on to score and the Tones were crowned All-Ireland champions. “Theyhad  county players, they were from all around. Moss Keane was full-back, he was a big tower of a man but Tom Quinn was too much for him.”   All-Ireland club - Tommy is on the extreme left of the front row Later that night, Cassidys lorry ferried the team up and down Bellaghy street to a heros welcome. Absent was the cup, as East Kerry didntit. “It is the sort of thing they cant take away from you,” Diamond said, of achieving the pinnacle of club football. He would later turn to management and managed Derry for  months at the end of the s, but stepped down after he felt the County Board were not allowing him full control of the team. Before that, at the start of the  season, Bellaghy were unable to get a senior manager, so Diamond put his name forward. The Tones went seven seasons without a title and werent tipped for glory. “Nobody wanted to take it. A lot of these managers, unless theyare good they are not interested at all,” he said. After winning the Derry title, Diamond took his side to Crossmaglen for the opening game of Ulster. After a battle, Bellaghy came out on top, but lost in the next round by a point at home to Castleblayney. “We shot in and shot inand Blayney went on to beat Burren in the Ulster final. I went to it in Dungannon, it was a dour match, - to -,” Diamond recalls, as Burrens quest for four-in-a-row failed. ”I said I would take themas far as I can, there wasnt much hope for them. We got them going rightly and I was disappointed we didnt win an All-Ireland with that team. I felt they were good enough.” *** Another passion is golf. He has been member of Ballymena Golf Club for  years, where he still plays with lelong friend Gerry McCann. He has been a member of Moyola, where he is now the Ranger.  Tommy andSeve Ballesteros Another friend of Diamond, Willie Cassidy, pulled off a coup in  by bringing Seve Ballesteros to play a round at the course, just months after he won the Masters. “I think it cost pound, to bring him to Moyola, he was number one in the world and Willie got him,” Diamond adds. “It is the only course in the north of Ireland I think he played on and I had the honour of caddying for him, I was the lowest handicapper at the club. “I marked his card, he countersigned it and it is up in the clubhouse for ever more amen.” A letime of memories. Aside from the current lock-down, the chat continues every Thursday night over the winter. Tommy plays cards with friends and his sons. It is a ritual. The social hub and the legacy of parents John Joe and Cathys cafe continues. RELATED - Derrys path to their first taste of September. Click here...

He was impressionable. In September, he was listening intently to the wireless, as Derry launched their first bid for Sam Maguire. He wasnt just reliant on the radio waves to savour the magic. Twice a week, the Derry team would train in nearby Newbridge and he got to meet his heroes. Where the towns Credit Union now resides, John Joe Diamonds cafe was located on Bellaghys Castle Street. Tommy, now  years of age, vividly remembers the scene as his mother Cathy made plates of sandwiches for the players before they ed home, to the four corners of the county. googletag.cmd.push “When you get the county stars in your kitchen twice a week, I got to know them all well and I was friendly with them through the years,” Diamond begins. Sean OConnell would later train the Derry teams that Diamond would captain to All-Ireland glory. “I played with him too, hiscareer lasted a brave while...he mustve been  when he was still playing with Derry,” Diamond adds. When Bellaghy All-Ireland winning manager Harry Cassidy took charge at county level, he called Diamond into the senior  in the early s. He was part of the team that toured New York and Connecticut. googletag.cmd.push “We went out to play exhibition matches out there. It was an experience to get out there. We also won the Wembley Tournament two years in a row.” The semi-finals were played in the iconic stadium, with the final played out in New Eltham. “I was taking a look the other day and I think I have played in every county in Ireland,” Diamond added, of a county career that ended in . But it was the s, when he left his greatest imprint. *** In , Tommy was on Bellaghys first county U championship winning team and was a minor champion three years later. At county level, Derry minors had yet to reach an Ulster final. The first of Diamonds three years in the county minor team began in the closing stages of a game in Dungiven, with Antrim in the lead. “I remember being threw on as a late sub and two balls were kicked right over the full-back,” he recalls. “They landed in my hands and all I had to do was to kick them into the net and I think we won by a point.” After another season of consolidation, a place in the final again eluded them, but there was a crux of a team still eligible for . “We knew from , we had a good  and we didnt lose many,” said Diamond, who was made captain. When Derry defeated Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh on their way to the  minor league final, they did so without the St Columbs Derry players who focussed on winning the MacRory and Hogan Cups, under the management of former Fermanagh player Fr Ignatius McQuillan, just four years after tiptoeing onto the Ulster Colleges scene. “Then seven or eight of them came onto the Derryteam – which was some help,” Diamond added. “FrShields was the man who put the backbone into us and Sean , he put all the final touches to us, he was a great trainer.  Sean OConnell, Tommy Diamond and Fr Seamus Shields with the Tom Markham Cup “We trained twice a week up in Ballinascreen and after training we went into Timoneys for sandwiches and milk every night.” Aside from the medals and success, Diamond is grateful for the memories and friendships built up, that stood the test of time. “If any of us ever meet each other, it is a half day session. Thats the great thing about it.” They hammered Donegal in the  first round, in Dungiven, but the win came at a cost with a knee injury to Chris Brown. In the semi-final it was a dferent story and it was a narrow - to - win over Down, a game that saw Phil Friel sustain three fractured ribs. “We beat Cavan in the final in Clones,” Diamond remembers. “It was a hard, dour match and a typical Cavan match with hard hitting and not a lot of finesse about it.” Derry were Ulster champions and with the Hogan Cup now in the county, there was an air of quiet confidence as the squad headed to Croke Park. Diamonds first memory of their epic semi-final with Roscommon was giving the referee his name. “I was marking Dermot Early that day and we got booked after  seconds,” he laughs. “It was some start to a semi-final. I caught the ball and as soon as I caught the ball, he hit me. He was about two seconds late, I hit him with an upper cut and put him on the broad of his back and both of us were booked.” Derry were - to - winners and with the game in the melting pot in the second half, Early pulled a penalty wide of the posts when the Rossies were four points in arrears. “The great Miacutecheaacutel Oacute Muircheartaigh was commenting and he called it the game of the golden goals. Every one of them was hit in from  yards, absolute screamers.” It was time for one last push. Derry had one hand on the Tom Markham Cup. So too had Kerry. *** The Kingdom had the breeze and thanks to some wastefulness in Derrys attack, Kerry were a point ahead at the break. Sean OConnells pep talk worked wonders and the cogs began to turn. Tommy Diamond and Seamus Lagans performance at midfield helped them to a - to - win. “I dont remember an awful about it.” Diamond says. Earlier in the day, GAA President Alf Murray asked himhad his speech prepared with the customary lines of Irish, should Derry win. “I had no Irish, so he penned out the speech with the phonetics and I tucked it into the pocket of my shorts”. The speech mustve slipped out during the game and as he stood on the presentation podium, Diamonds pocket was empty. “I am the first man to just speak in English, I dont think it went down to well but I just had to go ahead with it,” he continued. The team stayed out in Portmarnock on the Saturday and Sunday night. Just recently Donal Mullan, son of county official at the time Paddy, handed Diamond a ticket from the post-final banquet. “The entrance admission was just  shillings,” he added. The homecoming on the Monday took nearly six hours, with crowds coming out along the route to salute the new champions. There were bonfires as the team crossed the county border. On the final leg of the journey, the victory cavalcade of cars coming to Maghera streamed all the way back to Tobermore. The Brackaghreilly Pipe band led John Mulhollands decorated lorry up Maghera street. “I remember being up on the top of the cab. They had a seat and I was tied into it and held the cup,” Diamond proudly beams. “It was some occasion for the firstchampionship to come into Derry.” Two years later, with Diamond still as captain, Derry won the Ulster U title before getting trounced by Mayo in the All-Ireland semi-final in Charlestown. “We were favourites for Ulster but we just werent ready for it ,” Diamond admits. “We were a year young and the next year we were all U and Sean OConnell was still in charge of us.” In , Derry swept all before them in Ulster, with only Down putting up any sort of resistance and Seamus McCloskeys - tally was enough to see off Monaghan in the final.

He was dismissed, along with his brother Laurence, in the  semi-final win over Kilrea and missed the final. “Bellaghy had a strong  of players,” Diamond points out. “I only got my place on the senior team when Anthony Madden went to Australia and I got his place at right corner back.” There was nothing  only football and it is still the case.

A mauling that led Pete McGrath to admit, in the post-game interview, that Mourne fans deserved an apology. The gesture didnt sit well with the Down players. Monaghans Gerry Mone gave Derry a torrid time in the Ulster semi-final at Casement before Joe Brolly came from the bench to give the spark needed for victory. The Ulster final saw Damian Cassidy gracefully skating over the puddles in Clones, in a game the Derry players were going to win, come hell or high water. It took a late block by Tony Scullion on Manus Boyle and Brian McGilligans intervention to deny Donegal another goal chance, when they had crafted a two on one situation. googletag.cmd.push In the All-Ireland semi-final, it wasnt until Johnny McGurks wonder pressure point that Derry would eventually rest easy against the Dubs in the season-defining clash. Anthony Tohills outstretched arms of celebration before Joxers kick went over the bar will always stick in my mind. The branch of the Derry Supporters Shop at the top of Hall Street in Maghera was thronged with people in the lead-up to the final. There was so much expectation that Sam wouldon the Monday evening. In a powerful video interview with Shane Stapleton on #OurGame, Tony Scullion touched on how he felt the wave of emotion was almost congratulating them as they departed for the final. It was a Cork team that hammered a poor Mayo outfit in the semi-final, I thought. With hindsight and on watching the final, from someone outside the camp, the mental strength was Derrys greatest asset that day. Cork had nine players who had played in an All-Ireland senior final. They had played in five, winning two and losing twice, once after a replay. Derry, while being the upcoming team and having dispatched the  and  champions on their way, they were untested on the biggest day of the season. HAMMER BLOW From my position on the Hill that day, I can still see Joe Kavanaghs number  jersey cutting through the Derry defence before hammering past the advancing Damien McCusker. It was the first goal Derry had conceded since June , that sunny day in Castleblayney when Derry fans applauded Monaghan scoring their only point of the first half. In the second half, three Farney goals had Oakleafers shaking, before getting out with a draw. Kavanaghs goal brought me back to that day. Derry never do anything the easy way. Colin Corkery won the first two balls off Gary Coleman, John ODriscoll beat Tony Scullion to an early possession. Corks running game had Derry in all sorts of trouble. Fergal P McCusker and Henry Downey couldnt get to grips with Don Davis and Joe Kavanagh respectively. When Derry eventually went on an attack, Mark OConnor won the first battle with Seamus Downey. Derry were - to - in arrears. Was Derry going to fail the final hurdle again  Brian McGilligan then won a vital possession at midfield. It was small, yet massive. Later in the attack Damian Bartons trademark disguised hand pass - where he looked one way and gave the ball the other - found Johnny McGurk who fired over Derrys first point of the game. It took a series of Cork mistakes to swing the momentum. Teddy McCarthy dropped a routine pass from Niall Cahalane and McGilligan curled between the posts. The now dominant Tohill hoovered up a loose Teddy McCarthy pass before going on a storming run to win a free and Gormley slotted over. The Oaks were now only two points in arrears and growing in confidence. McGilligan turned the screw even tighter. John Kerins had been targetting Barry Coffeys height advantage over Johnny McGurk on his kick-outs. Across came McGilligan to win a ball he had no right to. It was inspirational. The big man launched a pass forward that eventually found Damian Cassidy. Cass swung a ball into the square. Seamus Downey made up the guts of  metres to take advantage of a mix-up between Kerins and OConnor, before punching to the net. Boom. Derry were on top. Heaney nearly beat Kerins to the ball for a further goal chance and, earlier, the Cork stopper made a brilliant save to deny Cassidy. Then referee Tommy Howard made two wrong calls. Cahalane buried Enda Gormley off the ball and got off with just a lecture. Seconds later, Tony Davis was harshly sent off for a lazy lunge at Dermot Heaney, with Howard gesturing the use of an elbow. It was the wrong call. The narrative was always that the punch woke Enda up. Thats harsh I feel. There was very little ball directed into his corner before that. Everything went thought Brolly. However, it lit a fire and Gormley went on to score six points. Derry twice led by three points and when Dermot McNicholl curled over, after the interval, it shouldve been the catalyst to push on. Brolly was toasting Brian Corcoran and shouldve been used more. John ODriscoll started the second half at wing forward, with Colin Corkery in on Tony Scullion. But when Don Davis inch-perfect pass took out the entire Derry defence, ODriscoll drilled to the net and Cork were ahead. Thats where the Derry resolve was again tested. And they passed. There was no sign of panic. McGurk was allocated the extra-man role. Fergal P McCusker, Henry Downey - and later McKeever – ran the show in defence. With the extra man, Damien McCuskers outfield experience saw him use short kick-outs before they were even invented. For all their control, they failed to ask any questions of Derrys defence, but when Gormley levelled the game, the Ulster champions superior fitness carried them into the three point lead. Even then, Derry did it the hard way. With Steven OBrien now at full-forward, Cork began to throw the dice for the last time. If every the term getting over the line was used, then this was all so relevant. Derry had performed better on other days during the Eamonn Coleman era, but winning was the only thing. Failure wasnt an option and they refused to be denied their moment of glory. It was richly deserved. Its just a pity there was no back door and that Eamonn was controversially sacked. This group had so much more to offer. RELATED - Sideline View wants Derry to fast forward.Click here...

The smiling photograph of the little girl in a First Communion dress was taken by former Derry Journal photographerLarry Doherty in the s. It lay uncollected in a box for many years until Larrys daughter, Moira Doherty, discovered it recently and posted it on Facebook in the hope of reuniting it with its owner. Tracy Morroi, who is a teacher at St Patricks Primary School in Pennyburn, was contacted by a friend who noticed the striking resemblance to her, but at first she thought it was just a coincidence. googletag.cmd.push I said Im not old enough to be in a black and white photograph, said Mrs Morroi. As time went on more and more people contacted her who suggested it was her mum, Maura Wade nee Doherty, who passed away almost seven years ago. At first Mrs Morroiwas unsureit wasdefinitely her, and she didnt want to collect the picture in case it belonged to another family. However, she was inundated with calls and messages from people who remembered her mother as a young girl and confirmed it was indeed her in the picture. Maura Dohertywas born in  the front room of her grandparentshome in  Bishops Street, which is now the Oakgrove Bar. googletag.cmd.push Her parents Maureen and George Doherty then moved to  Long Tower STreet where she grew up and attended the Wee Nuns school. My mammy worked in all the factories so everybody knew her, explained Mrs Morroi. She was a really bubbly person and would have chatted to anyone. Its been really nice to hear from people who remember her. I picked up the picture and it really made day. It was so emotional. Its so special to get it because I only have two other pictures of my mother as a child.  Mrs Morroisaid the whole experience has been very emotional. I had been doing a redding out the house this week and I had come across a lot of my mothers things so I was just having wavesof emotion anyway and this happened. Ive just been crying my eyes out.

Michael McWilliams writes a weekly column in the Irish News called Dodgy Tackle. For this weeks column, which is in todays Irish News, McWilliams puts forward his best ever team. The criteria for selection is based on the premise that his World XI must be made up of up of players from dferent countries who have never played for the same club sides. McWilliamssfinal selection includes many of the worlds best known footballers - and our very own Felix Healy. googletag.cmd.push His full line-up is: Manuel Neur , Junior , Paul McGrath , Paolo Maldini , Felix Healy , Paul Gascoigne , Dragan Stojkovic , Zinedine Zidane , Kevin de Bruyne , Kenny Dalglishand Diego Maradona . Explaining his choice of Healy in the midfield, McWilliams states that it was a straight fight between the Derry man and the Colombian World Cup Carlos Valderrama. He writes: Carlos Valderrama nearly went in here, but when it comes to moustachioed midfield fulcrums, the Derry man gets in on a dodgy decision. And it is Dodgys decision. Hes playing at the base of the Diamond. Just across from the Sandwich Co. Pulled the strings for an early eighties Coleraine side that delighted this young fan, all shimmies and subtlety. The only things hairier than his upper lip were the legs bulging out of a pair of royal blue Adidas hotpants, briefly ditched for a pair of white ones as he led the Honduras midfield a merry dance for  thrilling minutes at the  World Cup. Swapped blue and white stripes for Candy ones later in the decade and a treble was duly delivered. Can now be seen leading punters a merry dance in music venues across the north-west. googletag.cmd.push And McWilliams had a message for anyone who believes that Colombian star Carlos should have got in to his side ahead of Healy. You can stick your Valderrama up your Bogside, he writes.

Therersquos plenty like me and we are all in the same boat.ldquoIt started when I received requests from nurses who I made their wedding or bridesmaid dresses in the past for. I ended up making scrubs for some entire hospital wards, male and female and in a iety of sizes.ldquoThat widened out to sewing for staff at local nursing homes. I just want to do something to help, particularly for nursing homes as my daughter, Abigail, works in one in Castlewellan.There is plenty of work to be done to complete her bridal orders, but Mrs Moorhead feels that her priority is for scrubs.ldquoMy weddings have been pushed back until October or November or even next year. There are things that would hamper me. I canrsquot see brides to fit them and I wouldnrsquot want to go too far ahead with orders in case some people gain weight or lose weight, she said.ldquoAlso,the wedding changes seasons, that can change the outfit ordered in style and colour. For instance, a mother of the bride might want a jacket as well or might want to lose or shorten sleeves so I feel I canrsquot go to far ahead with my orders. Brides have needed me to reassure them that everything will be alright for their big day, whenever it happens, and I can absolutely promise that.ldquoAbigail is getting married in November and her sister, Johanna, is getting married next May, so they will be the most special wedding dresses I will make in my letime. I feel that I have to keep going with the scrubs as itrsquos so important. However, I will make sure that I will provide all outfits that have been ordered from me. It has become a family affair as Mrs Moorheadrsquos husband, Joe, who also is unable to work as an engineer in the lockdown, helps with the pressing of the garments while Johanna helps with the sewing.Mrs Moorhead has been creating the scrubs from donated material, much of it brand new, and is very grateful for the donations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar man takes Chance with move to Hong Kong 26 years later opens superstore  ","story":"AT the age of  and without a word of Cantonese, Richard Bowsie left his family and friends behind in his home village of Crossgar for a le of adventure in Hong Kong.Twenty-six years later and now a married father of two, Richard has found love, happiness as well as a successful career as the owner of two second-hand furniture stores in the huge cosmopolitan city with over seven million inhabitants.He and his locally-born we, Mavis, run nd Chance Furniture that provides shoppers in the city and online across the world a virtual Aladdinrsquos Cave with thousands of unique and affordable items - ranging from lacquered tables to pool tables, Chinese vases to Balinese drums.While other young ambitious men were told to lsquogo westrsquo, Richard went east, finding Hong Kong to be every bit as much the land of opportunity as the United States.The father of eight year-old daughter Kailey and son George, whorsquos coming five, literally changed his le in three days when he made the decision to fly to Hong Kong.From working as a leguard at the Tropicana centre in Newcastle and at the former Down Leisure Centre, the former student of the High School, Ballynahinch, had been close to completing his BTec qualication in Leisure Management at the former Newcastle College of Further Education.He ped out of his course a few months shy of graduation due to bullying. While his parents, Margaret and Ken, a well-known architect, were shocked at their middle sonrsquos decision, they were not surprised.He recalled: ldquoI had a friend who had travelled to Hong Kong three months previously. During a phone call he told me that the new international airport was under construction and work was easy to find. Three days later I arrived.ldquoI decided to go by myself as I had been trying to find an exciting job at home for a while but kept being told I was too young for the roles or lacked experience. My parents knew I was ambitious and how frustrated I was becoming with my career ambitions being knocked back all the time.Richard admitted he hadnrsquot a clue what to do once he arrived and took a bar managerrsquos job as an interim position as many of the airport workers drank there.His first job at the airport turned out to be with the Northern Ireland company, Lagan Construction Group, before going to another Belfast-based company, Rotary International, with which he worked for two years.ldquoI felt excited and nervous all at the same time when I first moved to Hong Kong, said Richard.ldquoThe first thing that struck me was the heat, after leaving cold and damp of home. Arriving in  degrees and high humidity was certainly a shock to the system, despite having been on family holidays to France most years with my family and once to America with a cross community group. The heat in Asia was a massive shock.Having grown up in a rented manse on the Rademon estate, Richard swapped a quiet rural existence for the hustle and bustle of the global port and major commerce centre. It was still under British rule and would remain so for another three years before it was handed back to China.Richard said: ldquoLanguage was the biggest shock but I made it my mission to learn the language and enrolled in YMCA lessons but also managed to pick it up from also working alongside locals.It wasnrsquot long before Richard felt confident enough to start out his own business, an electrical supply company which employed  staff.He said: ldquoI knew after the first few months that Hong Kong was going to work for me,you worked hard, nothing could hold you back, age was not an issue here. Opening a business here was very straight forward, just need a bank account and register an address.He met his we Mavis during his first month in the city and the two have been together ever since.They opened their first store in  in the after seeing a large amount of good furniture being thrown away each week and were determined to do something that would reduce the waste and help the environment. Within months, they had outgrown this store and relocated to their current , sq ft premises in Tuen Mun.The couple has recently opened a second, , sq ft premises in Chai Wan which is closer to the busy capital.Fluent in Cantonese for many years, Richard has seen Hong Kong go through many challenges, not in the least with the recent coronavirus pandemic.ldquoHong Kong has handled the virus very well, having been through SARS and bird flu before, said Richard. ldquoAs soon as we heard there was an issue over the border in China, Hong Kong went straight into prevention measures before even being advised to. Now everyone wears masks and observes hygiene measures.The preventative measures must have been successful as the city recorded zero deaths on Monday for the first time since the outbreak before Christmas.While the move to Hong Kong was the right one for Richard, he still misses home and his brothers and sisters, Simon, Gillian, Laura and William.He said: ldquoI miss the food, the greenery and, of course, my family who are all still in Northern Ireland. I miss being close to home as I have lost family members and grandparents.ldquoBut we come home as often as we can. Mavis and the kids love Crossgar, especially AJs Diner. They love the Rademon estate where we lived beside, walks down the Church Road to Kilmore and the open green fields. We have very few here in Hong Kong and any we do have are full of mosquitos.Home is always on Richardrsquos mind, as is his business.He adds: ldquoNext for our business is hopefully more expansion as I would like to start exporting furniture to other countries such as Northern Ireland.

Mr James said bluntly yesterday:ldquoThere are people who had an opportunity to say things at an early stage but did not. Now they have really pulled the carpet out from under our feet at an advanced stage. Irsquom bitterly disappointed at this kind of timing.The problem arose when the Housing Executive was in the final stages of preparing a scheme, which has been on the drawing board for several years, when it was told of the Government objections to a number of potential sites, including the Burren River catchment area and another, the most important, at the Dundrum Road end of the town.The Executive had finally got an agreement to purchase from the landowner of the Dundrum Road site and had made a final routine check with the Government departments before clinching a deal.

It is also my understanding that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and Northern Irelandrsquos other  councils are working closely alongside the government department at this time.Cllr Walker said he would like to see the recycling centres open again, suggesting that strict controls could be introduced to only allow two vehicles access them at any one time.ldquoI would also appeal to people at this time to keep their waste until the recycling centres are open again. I appreciate that many people who are not at work at the moment are making the most of the time they have to clean out their homes, sheds and garages and I commend them for being active.ldquoHowever, it simply isnrsquot on to load up you car with waste, drive to a secluded area and dump it. I just donrsquot understand the mentality of people who engage in this kind of behaviour.Cllr Walker also said the cost of clearing up illegal waste is borne by the districtrsquos ratepayers.ldquoWe have the ironic situation that those who dump their waste illegally end up paying for its removal viatheir rates. This beggars belief, he declared. ldquoThe stupidity of those who dump waste in secluded areas is beyond me.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe time has come for common sense and people really need to catch a grip of themselves. One of the most worrying aspectsof illegal dumping is that waste which ends up in fields is sometimes eatenby livestock which often results in deadly consequences. To those who dump their waste illegal my appeal is stop now.The local council has confirmed that it is receiving increasing reports about fly-tipping across the district since the start of the COVID- crisis. But the organisation insists that it is currently able to manage the issue within existing resources.A council spokesman said that the organisation continues to work closely with the Environment Agency which also performs a key role in addressing incidents of larger illicit dumping.On the issue of reopening the districtrsquos household recycling centres, the spokesman explained that the decision is continually being reviewed in line with government social distancing measures.He continued: ldquoFly-tipping is illegal and the council will strictly enforce this where evidence can be gathered. Responding to fly-tipping incidents also erts important council resources away from providing other essential services.The spokesman confirmed that the council is unable to remove illicitly-dumped waste from privately-owned land, explaining that where this occurs, both it and the Environment Agency has the legal powers to request its removal.He said the council will enforce this where required.The spokesman added: ldquoThe council would urge the public to avoid producing any unnecessary waste, including undertaking DIY and house and garden clearances at this time due to the considerable pressure being placed on public services.ldquoAny additional waste that is produced should be stored for future disposal at the household recycling centres once they re-open.

In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Queen.jpg","title":"Queen Karen Europe’s best  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother is a European powerlting champion at the age of .Karen Burns won the European title in France in March and set a new world record in the process.Powerlting involves three disciplines mdash squat, bench press and deadlt mdash and Karen capped a brilliant performance with a world record breaking lt of  kilos in the deadlt.Itrsquos a fantastic achievement for Karen, who only took up powerlting four years ago.The legal secretary, who has two daughters and four grandchildren, started gym classes at the age of , but within a few months made the switch to powerlting.Coached by Aaron Kelly, from Affinity Fit at the CG Fitness gym in Annacloy, she trained four times a week and was soon competing and winning medals at a national, international and world levels.She was the British champion two years running in  and .

I noticed within the first several days that I was able to breath more easily in the mornings and I was coughing much less. I am not a smoker.ldquoThe incessant pace of traffic in the street has slowed to a hush and my window sills inside my house are much cleaner. Before the lockdown, I could have drawn a line across the sills with my finger and it would have left a white mark in the soot which would gather.ldquoHaving the time that lockdown has inadvertently provided, I decided I would respond to a call-out to have-a-go playwrights to write something about their experience of self isolation.Gavin describes the scene as he pulled out the plug to let the water away. ldquoIt suddenly came to me as I watched the water drain away that it was an analogy for humanity, that we too are in great danger of being sucked down the plug hole to oblivion.So I got ready and immediately wrote the whole play sitting on the edge of my bed. It took me  minutes and I spent the next three weeks reworking it until I was happy.Central to the play is Jake, a man in his late s, who is in self-isolation and being cared for by his put-upon daughter, Martha.Gavin explains: ldquoWhile shersquos out getting groceries, he ponders upon the plight of the human race as it is metaphorically sucked down the plughole to oblivion.ldquoThroughout the play, Jake is visited by several characters mdash a City shark who represents the financial markets, a Navy er who see that humanity is in terrible trouble, the Prime Minister and God, who commands a less-than-enthusiastic Jake to build an ark and save mankind.Gavin says Jake becomes overwhelmed thinking that itrsquos too big of a job to build an ark. Hersquos not surehe has got the energy.ldquoThe play also includes two young mothers debating a brutal and radical way to build a new plug from the flesh and bone of every misfit in society, two floating dim-witted teenagers and a dancing bath plug bearing a last minute solution to the problem, said Gavin.ldquoAt the end of the play, Jakersquos lottery numbers come up and his winning ticket appears in the beak of a dove mdash the Christian symbol for peace.Down the Plughole, which reads as a tragicomedy, shines a spotlight on modern society and its impending doomlove and kindness fail to prevail.Gavin says he has taken inspiration from two comic plays, One Man, Two Guvnors by Richard Bean and Government Inspector by Nikolai Gogol, and the classic novel by William Golding, Lord of the Flies.Gavin added: ldquoJake realises that in the end money is worthless and that love and good health, which are in short supply in the play, are all that is important.Amelia Madan, head of amateur plays at Josef Weinberger Plays, said: ldquoDown the Plughole is a hilarious, ludicrous and bold play for these crazy unchartered times.ldquoWe are delighted Gavin chose to put some of the uncertainty about out fate as a species we all feel, into words, with a generous dash of delicious absurdism and a fabulous ending..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Spa.jpg","title":"Spa Wells LOL provide gift packs to health workers  ","story":"LOCAL Orangemen have been looking out for frontline workers during the current public health emergency.Members of Spa Wells Orange Lodge distributed free gt packs which included Easter eggs and cosmetics for health workers based at two local nursing homes.Approximately  staff who care for elderly residents at Fishbourne House and Spa Nursing Home were thrilled to receive their pamper packs and thanked the lodge for thinking of them in the current situation.Lodge member John Aiken said they were delighted with the success of their community project and added they are currently working on another similar community-based initiative..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/11266575.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"family party hold maud celebrates th distance social distancing","story":"PLEASENOTEIt is a tough time for our entire community and especially the business community.

This would be known as Serious Condition Criteria.While widely welcomed, what was not made clear was Departmental staff have discretion around who meets criteria and can overrule a claimantrsquos medical evidence.A number of enquiries were submitted to the Department under a Freedom of Information request.The responses are concerning.The Department stated legislation does not refer to serious conditions but rather whether there is a relevant change of circumstances. The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who are unlikely to ever move into work: ldquoTook effect from  September , but did not result in legislative change.The Department was asked about the right of appealing a decision rejecting a claimant for Serious Conditions Criteria, who responded: ldquoThere is no automatic right of appeal against a determination which is embodied in or necessary to a decision. , a claimant has a right of appeal against an outcome decision rather than a determination, which is merely a component of the outcome decision.This was complicated for non-legally trained or represented claimants, so questions were put around full compliance with the Disability Discrimination and Human Rights.The Department responded stating it: ldquoDoes not hold any information relating to this hellip.may have been undertaken by DWP.A copy of the risk-assessment template used by the Department in instances of considering Serious Condition Criteria, was requested, but: ldquoNo template existsInstead, the response referred to assessment procedures where Departmental Healthcare Professionals advise on the re-referral period, and consider whether a claimantrsquos condition meets: ldquoThe new severe conditions criteria andno further assessments are required.However, the claimantrsquos own medical professionalrsquos opinion around Serious Condition Criteria could be over-ruled, with this decided by: ldquoAn Administrative Officer appointed by the Department.In respect of providing the legislation or guidance which permits the Department to overrule clinical opinion provided by a claimant seeking consideration under the Serious Condition Criteria, the response referred to ESA Regulations , which: ldquoProvides for the redetermination of whether someone has limited capability for work. The time period in relation to this is not set down in the legislation but is largely at the Department Decision Makers discretion ndash usually based on available medical evidence including medical reports from ATOS hellip The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who would be unlikely to ever move into work, took effect from  September  but did not result in legislative change.As the Freedom of Information request was answerd prior to the restoration of devolution, the Department was asked with a Minister now in post, to comment on current processes around Serious Condition Criteria decision-making and in particular, how it can by discretion supersede a medical diagnosis by a claimantrsquos clinician. It was also askedprocedures are under review andthere is intention to bring forward legislation to allow for scrutiny or challenge.A spokesperson said: ldquo Anyone claiming ESA will be automatically assessed for the Severe Conditions criteria at their Work Capability Assessment by a Healthcare Professional. If the personrsquos condition or its al effects meet the criteria, the Department will be advised that no further assessments are required.In response to the overruling of clinical decisions, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe Work Capability Assessment looks at the al effects of a personrsquos condition, rather than the diagnosis itself. It is not a supersession of the opinion of their clinician.This dfered to the response provided prior to the Minister taking office, which appeared to show the Department was permitted to over-rule the evidence of claimantrsquos clinician.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reality is we will look at the medical evidence. The Northern Ireland Executive will have its own flexibility and we may see across the country some iations we saw some iations going into lockdown as well. Itrsquoll be a decision that all four nations take together based on the evidence, he said.Mr. Lewis said he was aware of the complexities of Northern Irelandrsquos Border with the Republic of Ireland amid the pandemic, explaining that he has been meeting with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill and Taacutenaiste Simon Coveney.ldquoEven where there are dferences in the approach between the Republic and the North,there are,we know that we can make sure we are clear with residents why those dferences are there.ldquoThe challenge of having iations within Northern Ireland is how we manage that.An investigation in The Sunday Times at the weekend featured a Whitehall source claiming the government ldquomissed the boat on testing and PPEand ldquojust watched as the death toll mounted in Wuhan, China.The report also claimed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson missed five crucial COBRA meetings in the Cabinet Office in London.When asked to respond to these serious allegations, Mr. Lewis said: ldquoI didnrsquot recognise some of what I saw in the Times.ldquoI was in the Cobra meetings in January and February COBRA meetings are chaired by the Secretary of State in the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms. Itrsquos a place, not a thing.ldquoWe were making decisions the scientists and medical experts were making decisions at that time and planning was going on. This is the point to judge it now when we have two months more evidence is dangerous and a misleading thing to do.Turning to PPE which has been an issue in Fermanagh, Mr. Lewis used his own constituency of Great Yarmouth as an example of where there has been ldquono problems with accessing equipment.He added: ldquoWersquove had gowns sent over to the UK, OrsquoNeills [sportswear] converted to gowns, there is gin distillery in your part of the world producing sanitisers.ldquoWersquore shting five and a half million pieces of PPE across to Northern Ireland. Wersquove been able to supply that itrsquos in good order. I am talking to the first minster every day that.Mr. Lewis said the priority of the United Kingdom government is to make sure ldquowe donrsquot hit the second peak of the virus.ldquoOne of the most damaging things economically would be, as well as health wise, to start coming out of lockdown ndash restaurants, pubs, whatever start opening again ndash and suddenly you have to close down again and thatrsquos not viable.ldquoI think itrsquos right to be cautious about this wersquoll make that decision in a few weeks.ldquoThe science is shting on this the experience is changing. I am cautious about predicting what will be in a few weeksrsquo time.He believes the government could ldquoflatten the curve of Covid-people continue to stay at home, adding: ldquoWe want to see past the peak, you donrsquot want to see a downward trend and ease up as all you do is let it shoot back up again.ldquoIf you think back to the beginning there were some quite scary numbers being put about by some experts about what the deaths might be. Now any death is too many and we have sadly lost people, friends and family who have gone through tragic experiences recently, and the figures are nowhere near those numbers we saw at the beginning.ldquoThatrsquos because the public across Northern Ireland and the UK have done a good job generally of following the guidelines which means we can flatten that curve, he said.Mr. Lewis explained that he had personal experience of people close to him who had been diagnosed with Covid-, including his parliamentary private secretary.ldquoSomeone I know lost a member of their family this week, I have a few people in family who had the disease.

There is a transition period where you are not really the Archbishop of Armagh but you want to be as helpful as you can and you are also I suppose trying to work out what and how you are going to approach the task.The Archbishop-Elect explained the three facets to the roleHe said there was the appointment of Bishop of the Diocese of Armagh, which has a larger population with a great number of large towns in it than Clogher Diocese.In addition, there is the role of Primacy of All Ireland, considered lsquoFirst among equalsrsquo acknowledging there is another Primate in the southern province but to some degree to be an ambassador for the Church of Ireland.He added: ldquoThe third element is your place within the wider Anglican Communion which I have relatively little experience of. You become a member of the Primatersquos Meeting which is one of the instruments of communion within Anglicanism. There are a number of ways we hold ourselves together, the Lambeth Conference, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council and more recently, the Primatersquos Meeting.So what type of church do you see under your leadership ldquoItrsquos dficult to speak for the church as the Church of Ireland General Synod is the body which has that authority. There is a saying that the Church of Ireland is synodically governed and episcopally led. What the Archbishop of Armagh can do is to speak to the Church and suggest can concern itself with. It sets a bit of a tone as well. Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is. If you treat people with respect, then relationships are easier.ldquoBy and large I felt people were for me rather than against me. It helpsyou are reasonably interested in people and their families and what they do and acknowledge that as an important factor in their faith. Whoever the next Bishop of Clogher is theyshould allow him or her to be his or her own bishop of Clogher and not that they should be like me, Brian Hannon or Michael Jackson or like St. Macartan.The Archbishop-Elect says he enjoys reading history and poetry and in terms of music, takes particular pleasure in the tradition of Anglican anthems . He does admit to particularly enjoying the Psalms which are poetry.The Archbishop-Elect acknowledges that his mother who had a profound influence on his le, reciting the Daily Office at home and was happily committed to God and His Church and would have sung the Te Deum while washing the dishes. One of her favourite biblical phrases was from the Gospel of St. John, Chapter  ldquoI come that you would have le and that you might have it more abundantly.Relaxation for the Archdeacon-Elect is visiting one of his favourite places, the Ulster Museum to see the collection of Irish Art and reading.ldquoThe thing I am looking to reading most is I took possession of the third volume of Hilary Mantelrsquos Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, lsquoThe Mirror and Light,rsquo an historical novel, he adds.The Archbishop-Electrsquos we Mary teaches in Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and his daughter, Dorothy, is at the University of Oxford.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Many parents are having to juggle working from home with home-schooling, and it is no surprise that Dr Justin Williams, a psychiatry expert at the University of Aberdeen, has concluded that stress amongst parents is growing as the lockdown continues. Most parents are not trained to educate their children, many will not have the time or the expertise to do so, despite many schools providing online educational tools. Trying to educate your child while doing your job effectively is surely not feasible in the medium or long term.There is also the obvious impact on children. If schools here don’tuntil September, that will be the best part of half a year wiped away from a child’s education. That is vitally important from both an educational and social perspective.Of course it would be unreasonable and unrealistic to flick a switch and expect schools toexactly as they operated before. A staggeredat some stage for dferent age groups has been mooted, while reducing classroom numbers might make social distancing easier to achieve.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Planning when and how schoolsacross the UK must surely be a key part of the government’s lockdown exit strategy. \"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Our neighbours in the Republic of Ireland have six. As was pointed out by Ben Lowry , around the Mournes, much of it is overrun by single dwellings.I can only conclude that the main reason we do not have a national park is because of the culture that exists here. I do not care how much money people have, but when planning decisions take away large swathes of the countryside and wildle habitat, it then becomes all of our concern.This is not an orange and green issue, but one of protecting the beauty and wildle of our country for generations to come.John Mulholland, DoaghBen Lowry: The RHI scandal has been a reflection of the struggle to keep good people in politics"},{"url":null,"title":"nspcc young people can be lonely home ","story":"NIE Networks union vows it will fight % pay cuts for power workersNHS doctors issue urgent nationwide alert as number of children infected with new Coronavirus related syndrome risesNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusNewsOpinionLettersNSPCC: Young people can be lonely at homeAt a time when children and young people are stuck at home, it is still possible for them to feel lonely.By LettersMonday, th April , : am\"\"Letter to the editor : Johnston Press ResellAnd because the majority of schools are closed, children are without the support network so readily available to them in a traditional classroom setting, and they may be venturing online to find solace.New research from the NSPCC shows that lonely children who are relying more and more on social media are twice as likely to be groomed online.More than , young people from across the UK, aged between  and , were surveyed by the NSPCC last year, with % confirming they had sent, received or been asked to send sexual messages to an adult online.

Rather than making political points, we should be focusing our energies on working together and not bringing ision ...people are playing party politics at this stage, I think that is very foolish, opportunistic and a bit crass.”Dr Kyle said that so far the health service in Northern Ireland had “dealt well with a dficult situation” but that there should be practical cooperation wherever it was needed without attempts to make political gain.He said that the pandemic needs to be dealt with on a global basis, with “all countries working together”.The east Belfast councillor said that would mean that “it is of course better to work in a cooperative manner with the Republic of Ireland. But similarly, it would be better for Ireland to work with the UK cooperatively”.He added: ”We need to have a sense of working together – both the UK and Ireland – because both our nations are so closely connected.”The veteran former GP also questioned those politicians who are urging Northern Ireland to follow the Republic because Ireland is an island.He said it was too soon to pass judgment on how the UK and Ireland had handled the emergency.“In retrospect, there will need to be a review of what has happened but in this situation people are trying to anticipate the future without all the facts in front of them, so decisions are based on the best information we have and people in good faith are trying to reach the best conclusions they can for the welfare of the public.“To pretend the south of Ireland is handling this well and the UK has made a hash of it is a rather ill-informed judgment because we are not yet at a point where we can review things properly and we are not comparing like with like – dferent population densities, dferent public transport systems, dferent demographic profiles, dferent proportions of black and ethnic minority populations who are particularly vulnerable, dferent levels of poverty, and so on.“To make the case that the pandemic strengthens the case for Irish unity is rather foolish. “What it does is strengthen the case for nations working together in a collaborative way.”—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

Social distancing is vital now in every aspect of our lives.“The NI Executive guidance remains in place for funerals so please be aware that when a funeral is taking place the regulations have not changed regarding times and the number of mourners present, the cemetery will be closed for visitors during funerals.“This should not be a problem – common courtesy, manners and dignity usually prevails when visiting a cemetery at any time for those of us who must.”Commenting on the decision by the Executive to allow cemeteriesto reopen, a spokesperson for Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council said: “As a council we welcome the announcement by the NI Assembly to change the Health ProtectionRegulations Northern Ireland Act .“We are acutely aware of the deep sensitivities surrounding the closures therefore all cemeteries will reopen…with the necessaryguidance in place to ensure visitor and staff safety.”In a statement, the Lord Mayor of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council, Councillor Mealla Campbell said: “I welcome the decision by the NI Executive to reopen cemeteries.“This has been a very dficult and emotional time for many people in our community who have lost loved ones.

I am requesting this meeting under standing order . Convening Special Meetings.“I would ask that you accede to this request as soon as possible. We note however, thatyou do not accede to this request within seven days we have the power, under the same standing order to call a meeting ourselves.”Cllr Causby continued: “Additionally, we understand that Council are working to provide a technology based solution to Council meetings. However, four weeks have now passed our Council has not met.“Given that the NI Assembly and the WestminsterParliament are still meeting, we believe that as with the previous special meeting, appropriate social distancing measures can be put in place and a meeting should take place in the WJ Mayes Hall.“It is our view that the full Council should be meeting at this crucial time as it is the elected members who are responsible for the direction and decisions being made for the organisation.“Party leaders meetings are good forums for discussion but they are not a placefor making decisions and we respectfully request that members are allowed to fulfiltheir democratic duty to govern the borough.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

INPT-. : -TONY HENDRONNNLocal MLA Jonny Buckley said: “I’m relieved that the Northern Ireland Executive have now come to the collective decision of reopening our cemeteries in a controlled manner.“This has been an extremely sensitive issue for grieving families and I am glad that Executive Ministers have reconsidered their stance.“Please keep safe whilst visiting the cemetery and adhere to social distancing rules.”Local MP Carla Lockhart said: “I know this has been heartbreaking for many families who have lost a loved one. Please await Council guidance on opening times and guidance on regulations.”Councillor Paul Berry said: “Let’s think of all those people who had loved ones die due to COVID and other health related illnesses but who couldn’t visit their loved ones grave . A very tough time for many many people.”SDLP Upper Bann said they were awaiting further details of opening hours and how it can be managed with social distancing but added: “For many people this visit is very important to them as part of their grieving process and something which they did on a daily basis prior to the pandemic.“The lockdown has robbed them of that special moment in the day where they go to visit the resting place of their loved ones.”Cemeteries were closed when social distancing measures were introduced towards the end of March .The NI Executive met on Friday afternoon and agreed that cemeteries throughout Northern Ireland could reopen.“This is about balancing public health concerns with the basic human need for people to visit their loved ones,” said First Minister Foster.Mrs Foster stressed it remains vitally important that the public remember they must continue to adhere to social distancing guidelines and wash their hands.Sinn Fein and the Alliance Party had previously supported the decision to close cemeteries across Northern Ireland.However, deputy First Minister and Sinn Fein vice-president, Michelle O’Neill, said the decision to re-open cemeteries came about because they had “listened carefully to the genuine distress of families who have not been able to visit the grave of a loved one”.“I understand that there’s a fine balance and making sure that people do not face additional burden in terms of their mental health and well-being and also our role in making sure that people are not put at further risk from the transmission of coronavirus,” she said.“So the opening of graveyards would only be permitted where there are those in charge of burial grounds that can ensure that we have compliance with the regulations and appropriate social distancing.“We continue to keep these issues under review,” she said.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1587656147249.jpg--marts_to_reopen_gradually.jpg?158765614700","title":"marts to reopen gradually ","story":"THE Department for Agriculture, Environment and Ruralaffairs has welcomed the decision by the Northern Ireland Livestock and Auctioneers’ Associationto open Livestock Marts on a gradual basis from Monday,  April.Livestock Marts closed voluntarily on  March - including Rathfriland Co-Op and Hilltown Saleyard - in response to Covid- health and safety concerns. Recently mart operators trialled a number of successful online sales to enable livestock trading to continue and are now gradually moving towards re-opening on a phased basis from next Monday, with some restrictions in place.In welcoming the decision, a spokesman said: “Farmers are key workers and are continuing to provide food for us all in very challenging circumstances. Part of that food supply chain is the ability to trade and sell animals.“Staff within the Department have maintained regular contact with Livestock Mart operators over recent weeks and have been reassured that robust operational protocols, developed by the Marts in conjunction with other stakeholders, will enable them to conduct business in a manner that is safe for staff, farmers and buyers and adheres to social distancing requirements.“DAERA therefore welcomes the decision to recommence sales of primestock, cull animals and store stock on a gradual basis from week commencing  April.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_caebbcfdabbf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_faffaceaecbcac   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
