I started Facebook, I run it, and I’m responsible for what happens here,’ he said, in words from a prepared statement.Zuckerberg accepted personal responsibility for the leak of users’ data (Picture: AP)Mr Zuckerberg said its audit of third-party apps would highlight any misuse of personal information, and said the company would alert users instantly if it ‘found anything suspicious’.When asked why the company did not immediately alert the 87 million users whose data may have been accessed by Cambridge Analytica (CA) when first told about the ‘improper’ usage in 2015, Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook considered it a ‘closed case’ after CA said it had deleted it.CA insists it deleted the data harvested by Professor Aleksandr Kogan’s personality quiz app as soon as it was informed it breached Facebook’s terms of use.Culture Secretary Matt Hancock will meet Facebook representatives in London on Wednesday.Facebook and Cambridge Analytica face multiple lawsuits over alleged misuse of personal information with at least five law firms in the UK and US investigating claims for compensation.Mr Zuckerberg said its audit of third-party apps would highlight any misuse of personal information (Picture: AP)On the subject of fake news, Mr Zuckerberg said ‘one of my greatest regrets in running the company’ was its slowness at uncovering and acting against disinformation campaigns by Russian trolls during the US election.He said the Russian campaign of disinformation had been discovered ‘right around the time’ of the US presidential election, and said the company had developed ‘new AI tools’ to identify fake accounts responsible.But he said: ‘They are going to keep getting better at this and we need to invest in keeping on getting better at this too.’"},{"url":null,"title":"nine ways to meet men that dont involve online dating","story":"Fed-up of trying to find love online?

B******ks.\u0027Always has been b*****ks and it remains it.\u0027We know very well that we cannot have the exact same benefits and actually it would have made sense - because it was the Tories that said they were going to secure the exact same benefits - and our position should have been to say they have said they are going to secure the exact same benefits and we are going to hold them to that standard.\u0027He was slapped down by the Labour spokesperson who said: \u0027Labour has set six tests for the final Brexit deal. \u0027Those include holding the Government to its own commitment to deliver the same benefits as the single market and customs union. \u0027We have been clear that, if those tests are not met, Labour will not back it in Parliament. Barry Gardiner fully supports that position.\u0027The row comes as the UK marks the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, which brought decades of sectarian violence and bloodshed to an end.  But Northern Ireland is again in a political crisis after powersharing collapsed over a year ago.The DUP and Sinn Fein have been at loggerheads over a range of issues including a proposed Irish language Act. And No10 has warned that Westminster could have to step in and impose direct rule on the region for the first time in more than a decade. Mr Blair today said Theresa May must give the Northern Ireland peace process her \u0027full focus\u0027 to end the current impasse, Tony Blair warned today.The ex-Labour PM said the Good Friday Agreement had been the start of a long journey away from the Troubles.And he warned that the process still needed the \u0027full focus\u0027 of the current Prime Minister at the most crucial moments.Devolved powersharing in Belfast has been on ice for more than a year after a breakdown in relations between the Unionist DUP and Republican Sinn Fein.Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton has warned that the hand of history will be \u0027heavy and unforgiving\u0027 if Brexit is allowed to \u0027undermine\u0027 the Good Friday Agreement.           Tony Blair voiced disbelief at the remark made by Barry Gardiner, saying \u0027I don\u0027t know how anyone can say that\u0027The former US secretary of state - whose husband Bill helped create the 1998 peace deal, which was signed 20 years ago today - said that reinstating a hard border would be an \u0027enormous setback\u0027 that could lead to a return to the \u0027bad old days\u0027.Britain and the EU are yet to find a solution to the question of whether there will be a hard border between the UK and Ireland after Brexit. Progress is due by the summer and failure strike an agreement acceptable to Dublin could scupper hopes of any deal at the crucial October summit. Mr Corbyn  said: \u0027The Good Friday Agreement was a defining moment in Irish history which allowed peace to prevail. It was a great achievement and I pay tribute to the work done by Tony Blair, Mo Mowlam and Paul Murphy, as well as those on all sides in Ireland, north and south, in achieving the crucial breakthrough of the peace process.\u0027No one wants to be marking the twentieth anniversary of the agreement while the assembly at Stormont remains suspended. Efforts must be redoubled to restore the assembly, and to ensure a lasting open border as part of the Brexit negotiations.\u0027There must be no return to a hard border between north and south, and no return to the horrors of the troubles. All of us on both sides of the Irish Sea have a responsibility to maintain hope for the future.\u0027The history of Ireland is a great teacher of oppression and brutality, imagination and poetry. For Irish communities everywhere – including in my own constituency – the Good Friday Agreement will always embody their hopes for peace and justice. We must cherish and learn from it for the future.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/10/14/4B038E3F00000578-0-image-m-24_1523365696636.jpg","title":"Barack Obama WONT going Prince Harry Meghans wedding","story":"    Prince Harry watches the Wheelchair Basketball finals with Barack Obama at the Invictus Games 2017 at Toronto Pan Am Centre last September          President Obama and his wife, Michelle, will not be guests at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding next month - and nor will President Donald Trump\u0027He makes my heart happy!\u0027 Dog with two legs leaves This...Israeli soldiers CHEER as a sniper shoots \u0027unarmed\u0027...‘We’re from England, go back to Algeria’: Woman SPITS at...Share this articlePresident Obama and his wife, Michelle, both friends of Harry, have also failed to make the cut, sources confirmed last night.The situation has left royal watchers wondering whether the Obamas, who are close to the prince, may have done the ‘decent thing’ and stepped aside so as not to ruffle the feathers of Mr Trump.Kensington Palace confirmed yesterday that the 600 guests invited to watch the couple exchange vows on May 19 at St George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle would all be those with a direct relationship with Meghan and Harry.          Prince Harry interviews former US President Barack Obama as part of his guest editorship of BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme in December‘This is very much about them getting married surrounded by their families and friends,’ a source said.‘It is not a big state occasion in any way. It is an intimate family wedding. Well, as intimate as a royal wedding can be.’The prince’s spokesman said the Queen backed her grandson’s decision not to invite politicians or foreign dignitaries for the sake of it.          The couple have decided not to invite any political leaders both from the UK and abroad, which means that even British Prime Minister Theresa May isn\u0027t on the list. Pictured is Prince Harry and Barack Obama at the Invictus Games in Canada last yearKensington Palace said: ‘It has been decided that an official list of political leaders – both UK and international – is not required for Prince Harry and Miss Markle’s wedding. Her Majesty’s Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by The Royal Household.’ Government sources said Theresa May ‘wasn’t expecting an invitation’.Despite the wedding being an important national occasion, Harry is not in the direct line of succession – unlike his elder brother, Prince William, who had no choice but to invite dozens of politicians and Commonwealth representatives to his 2011 Westminster Abbey nuptials.Harry is currently fifth in line to the throne, but after the birth of his third niece or nephew later this month, will slip to sixth, behind the Cambridges’ three children.Prince Harry and Miss Markle have also chosen a much smaller venue than William and Kate, who were able to fit around 1,200 guests into Westminster Abbey, including then-Prime Minister David Cameron.

But what is the Belfast Agreement?What is the Good Friday Agreement?The Good Friday Agreement helped to end 30 years of sectarian conflict, that were also known as \u0027The Troubles\u0027. This conflict began when Northern Ireland separated from the rest of Ireland in the 1920s and away from British rule.Northern Ireland was then ided in two groups, the Unionists or the Loyalists, who wanted to remain a part of the UK and the Nationalists or the Republicans, who preferred the independence. Catholics protested after being discriminated against in the predominantly Protestant north and from the 1970s, violence erupted between armed groups on both sides. British troops were sent to the area, but came up against the largest of the Republican groups, the Irish Republican Army, or the IRA.The IRA bombed areas of Britain and Northern Ireland and Loyalists in groups like the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) were also responsible for many deaths. In 1972, the situation became markedly more serious as the IRA began targeting police officers and British army soldiers on the street.  Davis: The border impasse has become harder to resolve since Leo Varadkar became Irish PM14 people were killed by British troops during a peaceful protest led by the Catholics and Republicans in Derry and in a day that became known as Bloody Sunday, dampening hope that Northern Ireland would ever be peaceful again.However, in the 1990s, the IRA announced a ceasefire and after two years of discussions and 30 years of the Troubles, the Good Friday agreement was signed.A new government was formed with power being shared between the Unionists and the Nationalists in a group called the Northern Ireland Assembly. Every house in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was sent a copy of the agreement before the referendum was held in May 1998.The two countries voted in favour of the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland Assembly took their seats in December. However, those who were against the peace, continued violence and in 2002, the Assembly was suspended and the UK government had to take over decision-making.In 2007, power was returned and the British army ended its operations in Northern Ireland, but ten years later, the deal collapsed and has yet to be restored.When was the Belfast Agreement signed?The Belfast Agreement was signed on Friday, April 10, 1998 at 5:30pm and on the day the deal was reached, US Special Envoy for Northern Ireland George Mitchell stated: ‘I am pleased to announce that the two governments and the political parties in Northern Ireland have reached an agreement.’Who signed the Good Friday Agreement?The Good Friday Agreement was signed by Prime Minister Tony Blair, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, SDLP leader John Hume, Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams, Sinn Féin member Martin McGuinness and Labour Party politician Marjorie \u0027Mo\u0027 Mowlam.          David Davis said the Irish government had been influenced by Sinn Féin in its Brexit policyWhy did the DUP oppose the Belfast Agreement?Despite the GFA deal gaining widespread support across Ireland, Ian Paisley’s DUP was the only major party to oppose it, believing it would scupper a union between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.However, distrust between parties caused problems when the agreement was first put in place, but Tony Blair managed to win over Ian Paisley. Issues also arose in 2017 when Martin McGuinness resigned as Sinn Fein deputy first minister after accusing the DUP of ‘arrogance’ while handling an energy scheme.The DUP’s Arlene Foster resigned and the Assembly collapsed, with McGuinness dying later in March 2017. Despite offers of help from Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, the DUP and Sinn Fein remain at loggerheads.Speaking in Belfast on April 10 2018, former DUP leader Peter Robinson said that he was ‘right to oppose’ the Belfast Agreement.‘Most people when they talk about the Belfast Agreement are talking about a wider process - it seems to have taken on some of the events that took place almost four years before it and every agreement that happened afterwards.‘So if we are talking about a process that has at its heart compromise, partnership, people working together to make progress, then I think the whole community should support that. The specifics of the Belfast Agreement itself, clearly I opposed - I think I was right in opposing it.’Does the Tory-DUP alliance affect the Good Friday Agreement? Despite the UK government remaining impartial when dealing with the unionists and the nationalists, a direct alliance with the DUP would change this. Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams warned that a Tory-DUP alliance would lead to a \u0027coalition of chaos\u0027 and could put the GFA at risk. Alongside this, when writing for The Guardian, Jonathan Powell, the chief negotiator at the Belfast Agreement talks, said that the partnership was \u0027a terrible mistake with lasting consequences\u0027 that \u0027would risk undermining 20 years of hard work\u0027.Will Brexit be affected by the Belfast Agreement?Brexit secretary David Davis\u0027s comments about the Irish government being influenced by Sinn Féin in Britain\u0027s withdrawal from the EU could present some issues if a hard border is proposed. While Britain, Ireland and the EU have all stated that they want to avoid a hard border, many believe this is not possible with Theresa May\u0027s promise of a frictionless border while also leaving the EU customs border.While the DUP oppose a united Ireland as an alternative to remaining in the EU, Sinn Fein are touting it and officials fear that a return to before the Good Friday Agreement could occur, according to The Guardian. Former US Special Envoy for Northern Ireland George Mitchell warned that direct rule and a hard border could lead to a return of the violence seen from the 1970s on BBC\u0027s Today programme. George Mitchell said that a hard border would result in \u0027stereotyping resuming, demonisation resuming and people turn inward\u0027, and a lack of power-sharing could lead to \u0027regressive forces\u0027 becoming violent again.Leaders should see this as a \u0027dangerous signal...and act before there is a regression,\u0027 he added.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/03/15/04A301F4000003E8-0-image-a-175_1522766360623.jpg","title":"Charity owner praises Peter Kay used comeback appearance raise 35 000 children","story":"    Peter Kay, 44, who made a shock appearance in Blackpool on SaturdayA grieving mother has thanked Peter Kay for raising £34,000 for her charity after he made a shock appearance at a screening of his hit comedy Car Share, calling him \u0027a real star\u0027.The comedian had not been seen since cancelling his sell-out UK tour due to \u0027unforeseen family circumstances\u0027.But the 44-year-old stunned fans by appearing on stage at Blackpool Opera house on Saturday night as new episodes of his sitcom Car Share were aired.The Bolton-born Phoenix Nights star told the delighted crowd at the special fundraiser: \u0027Thanks for coming!\u0027And now campaigner Liz Curtis from Warlingham, Surrey, has thanked Kay for raising a staggering £34,000 for her charity The Lily Foundation.Liz, 43, set up the charity in 2007 to raise awareness of incurable mitochondrial disease, an inherited chronic illness.Peter Kay adds a THIRD screening of new Car Share episode...Share this articleHer eight-month-old daughter Lily died from the condition, which causes physical, developmental, cognitive and learning disabilities, organ failure and seizures.\u0027We can\u0027t thank Peter and his team enough for this incredibly generous donation.

After such entries as Howard Jacobson’s take on The Merchant of Venice, Shylock Is My Name, and Dunbar, Edward St Aubyn’s King Lear, we now have a Macbeth by the king of Scandi-noir crime, Jo Nesbø. It turns out to be rather an inspired choice: the bloody tragedy of political ambition translates well to a corrupt police department in a lawless town, where the cops are just one more armed gang.The Scottish play is here transplanted to a geographically agnostic place that mixes terms of Scottish and Scandinavian origin (the area is Fife, the sharpshooter named Olafson), along with allegorical touches: the capital city is known simply as the Capitol. But we spend most of our time in a grim northern town where industry has shut down and it nearly always rains. From one clue we deduce that the story is set in 1970. (It turns out to be helpful to avoid the characters having mobile phones.) Nesbø piles on the forbidding atmosphere, writing of “the soot and poison that lay like a constant lid of mist over the town”, and several chapters open with the equivalent of an establishing shot in cinema, as the prose follows a single raindrop or seagull over the blasted town before happening upon major characters who are about to speak.Macbeth leads a paramilitary Swat unit. He is a man of the people, unnaturally strong, with a thing for daggers: admittedly an unusual detail amid these modern warriors fitted out with assault rifles and sniper scopes. (He is so good at throwing knives, we\u0026nbspare told, that he once nearly joined the circus.) Duncan, meanwhile, is the chief commissioner of the police and Malcolm his deputy. The leader of the narcotics unit, perhaps to avoid too many Scottish-sounding prefixes, is here known simply as Duff.The police are at semi-permanent war with a biker gang known as the Norse Riders, who serve as couriers for the top bad guy. This is Hecate: rather than Shakespeare’s queen of the witches, he is the town’s untouchable drug lord, an old man also known as the “Invisible Hand”. (The reference to the political economy of Adam Smith is deliberate.) He manufactures a\u0026nbspdrug called “brew”: not the alcohol whose effects Shakespeare’s hungover Porter wryly describes, but a\u0026nbspcrack-like substance to which half the town is addicted. Three of Hecate’s henchwomen play the role of the witches, promising that Macbeth will get the top job if he does nothing to interfere with the drug business. (In a nice touch, these women are also rumoured to use “toads’ glands, bumble bee wings, juice from rat’s tails” when cooking the drug.)It’s not long, then, until the murders start, with Macbeth egged on by his paramour, here known simply as “Lady”: a flame-haired femme fatale who runs a casino. Her scheme for him to murder Duncan is the same as Lady Macbeth’s, stabbing him while he sleeps and blaming it on his bodyguards –\u0026nbsparguably a terrible plan in the context of 20th-century forensics. But Macbeth gets away with it, and so wades deeper into the sea of blood that must finally engulf him.There follows much edgy paranoia within the police department and some excellent action sequences involving cars and guns. (A person is shot with “the sound of a thud like hammer on meat”.) Nesbø orchestrates scenes of blackmail and fighting with the slickness of a writer who has sold 36m crime novels. There are odd touches of the supernatural, sometimes with a naturalistic alternative explanation. (The ghost of the murdered Banquo turns up at a dinner, but Macbeth might just be hallucinating because he’s high.) Nesbø finds some clever twists, too, on the source material. It would be invidious to give\u0026nbspaway what plays the role of Birnam Wood, but\u0026nbspthe sequence is majestically satisfying.At times the novel strains credulity: no one notices the possible connection between the manner of Duncan’s murder and Macbeth’s fondness for daggers for quite a while, and when the newly promoted Macbeth gives a press conference explaining how his team have just shot dozens of people, the assembled journalists lap it up uncritically. The book’s style, in\u0026nbspDon Bartlett’s translation from the Norwegian, is\u0026nbspworkmanlike, but from the combination of simple materials a thought can arise that seems authentically, blackly bardic: “For eternal loyalty is inhuman and betrayal is human.”This is in the end a deliciously oppressive page-turner that, like The Tragedy of Macbeth itself, seems to harbour something ineradicably evil at its core. The main effect, indeed, of all the differences between this book and a standard modern potboiler is to remind you how weirdly nightmarish the original play is: what Shakespeare brewed up is still almost too over-the-top for modern, ultraviolent mass entertainment.• Macbeth is published by Hogarth.

It was created by Swiss chocolatier Barry Callebaut - the world’s largest cocoa processor - which spent more than a decade unlocking and experimenting with the beans’ colours and flavours. The flavour is described by the company as “a tension between berry-fruitiness and luscious smoothness” but no extra colours or flavours are added to create the pinky hue, which instead comes from a powder extracted during the processing. It is not as sweet as milk chocolate, according to its creators, with a lighter flavour instead.Ruby chocolate – a fourth chocolate after traditional dark, milk and white – has been attracting huge interest from chocolate connoisseurs throughout the world since it was first revealed in September last year. It is claimed to be the first new natural colour for chocolate since Nestlé unveiled white chocolate more than 80 years ago.The new KitKat was introduced earlier this year in Japan and Korea, where consumers are no strangers to unusual variations of the popular confectionery. In Japan the varieties on sale at any given time stretch to dozens, including purple sweet potato, edamame bean and wasabi. In the UK it will go on sale in branches of Tesco on 16 April. “We know that a new type of KitKat is a really big deal and we are very excited to be able to offer a different type of chocolate for fans to try” said Alex Gonnella, marketing director for Nestlé’s UK confectionery business. “Ruby chocolate is a big innovation in confectionery and we are very proud that KitKat is the first major brand in the UK to feature this exciting new chocolate.”Pablo Perversi, chief innovation, quality and sustainability officer at Barry Callebaut, said: “I am very pleased to see the result of our partnership with Nestlé – the iconic four-finger KitKat made with our ruby chocolate. Consumers across the world will be intrigued by the unique taste of this crispy delight.”Following the UK launch, the product will go on sale across Europe and the US.

An average of 11 stores a day opened, while 16 a day closed. The data does not include independent shops.Fashion and footwear stores were the hardest hit in 2017, according to LDC, as shoppers’ freedom to spend on non-essentials was diminished by rising food price inflation, partly fuelled by the fall in the value of the pound after the vote for Brexit in 2016.However, there was a net rise in the number of beauty stores in 2017, while cafes, coffee shops, ice-cream parlours and bookstores also increased in number, according to the LDC data.The pace of closures increased substantially in the second half of last year, reflecting the switch to online shopping, combined with rising staff and business rates costs. Shoppers reined in spending, with consumer confidence reaching a four-year low in December. Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC, said: “2017 was tough for the British retail industry, particularly the second half of the year. We saw volatility from month to month and across different sectors as wage growth failed to keep up with inflation, forcing many shoppers to think more carefully about their spending habits.”The problems have continued into the first quarter of 2018, which PwC said was the toughest first quarter since the last recession in 2009-10. Big names including Toys R Us and Bargain Booze owner Conviviality have fallen into administration, while New Look is closing dozens of stores in a major restructure. Mothercare, Carpetright and Homebase are all considering closing dozens of stores. On Tuesday, lingerie brand Ultimo confirmed that it is to be wound up, blaming “more cautious consumer spending”.Shoe chains Brantano and Jones Bootmaker called in administrators last year, resulting in the closure of about 170 stores in total, while discount fashion chain Store Twenty One went into liquidation, closing 125 outlets. Jaeger and Style Group, which includes Jacques Vert and Windsmoor, also closed some shops despite being rescued from administration.Some bigger chains including Clarks, Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Debenhams have closed a handful of stores as shoppers increasingly opt to browse and buy clothing via their smartphone or laptop.Glen Took, consumer insight director at Kantar, said clothing and footwear retailers’ troubles reflected a change in culture towards enjoying experiences rather than buying products. “People are trying to make the most of their time doing something with family or friends and then they go shopping on a Sunday evening on the internet. If you look at social media culture, if you are going to have an amazing time doing something you can put on Instagram, what is going to give? It could be you are going to wear the same shoes you wore last week.”The Works discount bookshop chain drove the growth in bookstores, while WH Smith has been adding new specialist book sites as readers return to physical books while sales of ebooks have slowed.But the rise of online services spurred a dramatic drop in the number of banks, travel agents and estate agents on British high streets last year. Travel agency chains were hit by the highest number of net closures - 326 - while 201 banks, including more than 60 HSBC branches, shut their doors. With the ability to access goods and services quickly from home, families have less reason to hit the high street and are more likely to buy items only when they need them rather than picking up something on impulse or planning ahead. High street expert Mary Portas said the government could help by cutting business rates, but retailers needed to adapt or die. “We are going through a massive transition. Businesses that are going down are sometimes too big to be nimble and responsive and sometimes they are just mediocre and they haven’t invested in what consumers want. It is about being innovative and creative.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7d4f348889ac862f23b75a69ed81ffa05414c10/0_106_5038_3023/master/5038.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=283aea16436a7975e1871582c2d03aba 1240w","title":"trinity mirror deal for express and star faces competition scrutiny","story":"£200m media buyout to be investigated by the competition regulator and culture secretaryThe £200m deal struck by the publisher of the Mirror titles to buy Richard Desmond’s Express and Star newspapers is to be investigated by the competition regulator and referred to Matt Hancock, the culture secretary, over potential concerns it will reduce media plurality in the national newspaper market.Trinity Mirror shareholders voted in February to approve the deal to add the Daily Express, Sunday Express, Daily Star and Daily Star Sunday newspapers, as well as magazines including celebrity title OK!, to its national titles the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People.The Competition and Markets Authority said on Wednesday that it was launching a phase one inquiry which will look at whether the deal will result in a “substantial lessening of competition” in the national newspaper sales or advertising market. The CMA said it has until 7 June to decide whether to move to a fully fledged phase two competition investigation.The CMA has also referred the deal to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media \u0026amp Sport to examine, saying it “considered that the transaction may raise public interest considerations”. Hancock will now weigh up whether the deal triggers media plurality concerns under the Enterprise Act 2002, which states that there is a need “in relation to every different audience in the United Kingdom or in a particular area or locality of the United Kingdom, for there to be a sufficient plurality of persons with control of the media enterprises serving that audience”. If he believes there may be concerns, he can ask Ofcom to look at whether the public will lose too much from a reduction in plurality with Trinity Mirror controlling so many national newspaper titles.Simon Fox, the Trinity Mirror chief executive, has repeatedly pledged that his Labour-supporting Daily and Sunday Mirror will keep Desmond’s Brexit-supporting titles editorially independent. “The Mirror is not going to go rightwing and the Express is not going to go leftwing,” he said. “They will absolutely all have editorial independence.”As the deal completed, however, the editors of the Daily Express and Daily Star resigned.

Will it work?It’s Good Friday in Brisbane and most of the city is dead quiet, with pubs and clubs not opening until midnight due to Easter trading laws. In the inner suburb of West End, however, something very noisy is stirring.On a makeshift stage in a large room, a three-piece band called Hexmere is playing a raucous, raw brand of grindcore punk to a small crowd. There’s another gig planned for the following night, with many more people expected.These all-ages shows are being sporadically staged by the Outer Space art collective, which won the Brisbane city council’s tender to operate this 300-capacity venue for two years, rent-free. The space needs work. But it represents an experiment, a gamble and a new hope for the city’s youth culture.The fact that the city council chose to make the space available is important. Despite a rich history, live music in Brisbane, as in so many other cities around the world, struggles to survive against the pressures of gentrification, regulation and competition.The music industry’s inextricable links to alcohol and bars has left a dearth of venues accessible to under-18s, raising concerns about how the complex ecosystem that sustains a vibrant local music scene – comprising everything from record shops to independent labels to public radio – will reproduce itself without engaging audiences from a young age.Live from Outer Space is an attempt to buck that trend in Brisbane. Coordinator Alex Campbell watches Hexmere as sound technician Hannah buzzes around the room, checking noise levels and sonic balance. Campbell says she has encouraged women and non-binary people to get involved in the male-dominated space of sound engineering especially.In the crowd tonight are the three members of the Goon Sax, back home in Brisbane after seven months in Berlin. Their 19-year-old frontman, Louis Forster, is the son of the Go-Betweens’ Robert – less than half a mile from the venue, the Go Between Bridge s the Brisbane river. But surfing the city’s next wave hasn’t been easy, even for a band with such pedigree.While the Goon Sax’s members were under 18, the venues they played required them to be accompanied by a parent and to leave immediately after their set, while their friends were unable to attend.Guardian Cities is dedicating a week to exploring the opportunities and challenges of Australia\u0027s rapidly growing cities. The nation of nearly 25 million has one of the fastest-rising populations of all OECD countries, overwhelmingly focused on its biggest cities: Sydney and Melbourne. But with car dependence, urban sprawl and unaffordable housing threatening their famed liveability, are they ready for the challenge? Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Brisbane face similar issues, while nationwide, poor indigenous consultation is a growing urban issue. Australian Cities Week, a collaboration with Guardian Australia, seeks to reveal and celebrate the culture, architecture, wildlife and character that bolster these cities\u0027 reputations as unique and desirable places to live.“It’s cool something like this has opened up,” says Forster. “I know my sister’s psyched about it – she’s 16 and she’s coming tomorrow night. I was pretty frustrated by it when I was a kid growing up. I remember going to soundchecks and standing outside venues and listening, stuff like that.”Brisbane takes some pride in its musical past – another international export, the Saints, are the subject of a mural celebrating their achievements on the other side of the river, and the band’s guitarist Ed Kuepper has a local park named after him. But the council’s decision to back Outer Space represents a recognition of the need to invest in the city’s cultural future.“There’s all these young kids who don’t have any places to go,” says Louis Whelan, who is director of Outer Space’s all-ages live-music programme and also plays in his own band, the Mouldy Lovers. “Most events are really alcohol-focused. Playing somewhere where people are just going to get wasted, it’s not the same thing as playing where people want to see music.“If there’s a whole new generation of people who are much more engaged with the arts and music, then when they get out and they have disposable incomes, they’re going to go to galleries, to venues, to buy local bands’ music and start their own labels. I think there’s a lot of value in it.”It’s not just kids who are struggling to find places to play. In Sydney – once a live-music Mecca to rival London or New York – bands now struggle to play at all, with venues under pressure from soaring real estate prices, noise complaints, punitive regulations and a cosy relationship between government and developers. The city’s longest-serving live venue, The Basement – which, over 45 years, has hosted artists from Dizzy Gillespie to Prince – closed last week, though its owners are hopeful of finding other premises.The situation has become so difficult that the state of New South Wales is now holding a parliamentary inquiry. Dave Faulkner, singer and songwriter of enduring Australian garage band the Hoodoo Gurus, told the inquiry that live music was treated like the sex industry, “as something to be shunned. We employ so many people, we generate incredible amounts of money throughout the economy – and yet we’re treated so badly.”Faced with similar issues, music scenes around the world have been forced underground, into house parties or often illegal warehouse gigs, accessible only to those in the know. “It starts to get a bit worrying when kids are in those scenes,” says Emily Collins, managing director of the government-funded advocacy body MusicNSW. “We’d much rather them be in venues where we can make sure it’s safe and they can learn to love music in a safe and supporting environment. At warehouse parties there are no security guards, there’s no regulation, no one monitoring alcohol consumption. And they’re more focused on over-18 activities anyway – not that anyone is checking ID.”All-ages shows have a twofold benefit, says Collins: they foster a self-sustaining community of audiences and performers that in turn helps nurture a creative city. The sticking point, particularly in Australia, is breaking the nexus between music and alcohol.Venues, already under severe financial duress, are reluctant to put on events where no money is coming over the bar and the regulatory environment is forbidding. “There are multiple bodies that need to be satisfied, so there is considerable complexity, high costs and red tape in running a compliant venue,” says Julian Knowles, chair of MusicNSW and a professor of music at Macquarie University.“There is no ‘agent of change’ law in New South Wales that puts the responsibility on developers to soundproof new developments near music venues. If new residents make noise complaints, the venue is held accountable and must meet acoustic treatment costs, so it’s very risky for venue operators. At best, it erodes business confidence and at worst it can shut down venues entirely.”The introduction of controversial lockout laws in 2014, imposing curfews on venues in a bid to curb alcohol-related violence more associated with nightclubs than live music events, have been relaxed to some degree, but otherwise only worsened the operating environment.Against this backdrop, MusicNSW offers funding to promoters and venues to stage all-ages shows, but Collins says applications are few. “People say it’s too hard as a venue – $15,000 won’t cut it.”Often bands are paid literally out of beer takings. “They’re basically saying: the more heavy drinkers attend your gig, the better you’ll get paid,” says Ray Ahn, bass player of another longstanding punk band, the Hard-Ons. “With that kind of a working model, it’s harder to organise all-ages shows. Where’s the money going to come from?”The parliamentary inquiry underlines what a cautionary tale Sydney has become. Dave Faulkner said the city’s culture was dying. “When people come to Sydney they don’t just come to see the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, they also go to have a night out and to see music – it’s what I do when I go to London or New York. But Sydney has been doing everything it can to destroy those places of entertainment and turn them into apartment buildings.”In the late 70s and early 80s, hundreds of pubs and clubs throughout the city and suburbs kept artists busy, with major Australian bands such as Midnight Oil honing their live skills by playing upwards of 200 shows a year.From the late 80s to the early 90s, Ahn says, the Hard-Ons would often play an all-ages show in the afternoon and another for over-18s in the evening. Now, they might have played one all-ages show in Australia in the last 10 years. When the band tour Europe or Japan, though, it’s a different story.“A lot of the shows we do in Europe are in purpose-built halls that have the bar on the outside,” Ahn says. “Inside, there is no bar – it’s like a flat-ceilinged room with a massive PA and volunteers running around everywhere. So where are they getting the money from? They’re getting it from the city council.”The environment in Germany was more easygoing, says Louis Forster, even when he was younger. “I spent a lot of time there growing up, and I could always get into venues – it was never a problem. Parents would bring their kids to shows, which was really fantastic.”In Australia, Melbourne actively promotes itself as the live-music capital, and with good reason. A Deloitte study in 2011 valued the sector’s economic contribution at over half a billion dollars, with small venues providing the bulk of revenue and employment. Though many venues have closed in recent years, the value of investing in the live-music sector at grassroots level has long been recognised.The Push, a not-for-profit youth music organisation, has been operating in Victoria since 1986, providing a launch platform for countless bands. As well as all-ages shows, it puts on mentoring programmes and skills workshops.Shaad D’Souza, a music journalist who used to coordinate all-ages events for the organisation, notes that it is a cultural investment as well as a financial one. “Lots of kids, when they grow up they’ll only really go to big festivals or big arena shows because that’s all they’ve had access to,” he says. “Whereas if you’re investing in all-ages shows, they develop a relationship with venues, they develop a relationship with artists, and then they know: ‘I want to support my local scene.’ They want to go to smaller venues they don’t just want to go to arena shows or festivals.”At the end of the night, Alex Campbell’s band, Bad Bangers, will launch their EP. The band are in their 20s now. “But that’s kind of why we started this – because there weren’t many all-ages spaces when we were younger.”In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

But for many it has a pervasive dark side: a city once branded as a sunny place for shady people.One of Australia’s most revered writers once told me he comes here to have his breakdowns. On a visit in 1997, Prince Charles was reported to have said its gaudy skyscrapers contributed to the “uglification” of one of the world’s top holiday spots. In 1984, the prominent Sydney architect Neville Gruzman suggested the city should be bulldozed into the surf.Today, the Gold Coast seems to be attempting that reinvention itself. It is Australia’s fastest growing city and larger than three of its capital cities (Canberra, Hobart and Darwin), with the 2018 Commonwealth Games doubtless accelerating a maturation already under way.Every month or so there’s a new hip place to be seen, an old high rise disappears and a shiny new one soars. Every week some new claim is made for the ultimate in gastronomic happiness.Do these ventures live up to the hype? Sometimes. But it hardly matters. The Gold Coast is a city built on hype, on rise and fall. As a longtime resident, I’ve experienced several waves of self-proclaimed urban renaissance and learned that, while the spin exists largely to generate the sale of sky homes, each growth phase possesses a grain of truth.The Gold Coast wants to grow up. But is that possible when the rest of the country’s estimations of it are so rigid?Unlike many major Australian cities, the Gold Coast does not retain much evidence of a colonial urban sensibility, in part because of rampant redevelopment and erasure, but largely because it never really got started.The urban vision was always more closely linked to a 20th-century American aesthetic. The influence of the strip cities of Miami, Los Angeles and particularly Las Vegas are in evidence as well as, more recently, nods to the 21st-century architectural ambition of Dubai and Shanghai. While each of these cities have marked differences they all share a postwar history of urban expansion and proliferation.All have grown at phenomenal rates, new frontier cities that owe less to major port affiliations or centrifugal notions of planning than they do to strip formations, late capitalism and experimental development. The big-ticket architecture says so.The $1bn luxury Jewel project currently under development epitomises this push for opulent new millennium design. An example of continuing high-end investment in architectural innovation, the development is a six-star three-tower structure modelled on shards of smoky quartz crystals found on a mountain in the region. The interpretation is refreshingly abstract compared with the ubiquitous “palm tree, primary colour” resort styling the Gold Coast has leaned so much on in the past.Across many sectors, the city is shrugging off the declarative localism it has played to in exchange for a more sophisticated spin on where it sits in the world. It will be interesting to note how the international spotlight will burn. In 2016, international tourism figures peaked at one million. Tourists from Asia make up the majority of those, as they have for decades. People from Singapore get the Gold Coast, as do people people from Hong Kong and Dubai – they are all cities that share a new frontier urban aesthetic.The real opposition to the Gold Coast’s ambition is national. Australians often experience the city in hyperactive mode, arriving to soak up the sun and get away with what they’re less likely to at home raging down streets like no one lives here, hiring mopeds and tuk tuks blasting Justin Bieber or ACDC, high on party drugs or table-sized martinis.

Or they may have vibrant memories of flying through the hyperreal universes of the Dreamworld, Movieworld and Seaworld theme parks as kids. It’s these off-kilter experiences – the combination of bright lights, sunburnt skin and cringey recollections – twinned with the consistent media overplay that continue to define national opinions of a city locals affectionately refer to as “the Goldie”.It is not unusual for major cities to have underworlds: corrupt power centres and schlocky, sometimes violent nightclub strips. It’s just that the depiction of such things erupting on Australia’s Gold Coast makes great trash TV. Stock footage proliferates of schoolies vomiting in bins, bikies brawling in restaurants, meter maids in gold bikinis and bare-knuckle violence – but these things exist as a fraction of a much larger whole.The burgeoning arts scene is emblematic of the city’s evolution. Twenty years ago, arts visibility, policy and recognition barely existed, and certainly not at levels that could match commercial imperatives. Today, the Gold Coast can hold its own. Under the directives of the Culture Strategy 2023, the city council has invested $7m in the development of an arts and cultural programme for Festival 2018, linked to the Commonwealth Games, while a $365m cultural precinct funded by all levels of government will be launched in stages. Yet the attitude of the rest of Australia towards the city, even though it is now one of the top five tourist destinations nationally, seems to be: “We want you to stay in your box.” Evidence of the Gold Coast’s continuing appeal as a preferred place to holiday and live goes largely unacknowledged.In part, this paradox is related to class. Australia prides itself on being an egalitarian society, but it can be highly parochial and territorial. The rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne is legendary neither would ever consider the Gold Coast as worthy of debate.The city’s location in Queensland doesn’t help. From 1968 to 1987, the state was under the corrupt rule of the disgraced premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, known as the “hillbilly dictator”, who fostered the creation of a police state and opposed homosexuality, abortion, demonstrations against anti-apartheid and even the 40-hour work week. Perceptions of Queenslanders have been affected ever since.This is no different from the idea that Parisians are all rude or New Yorkers unfriendly. The Gold Coast is more dynamic than its enduring mythologies suggest. It does not so much resemble an overgrown Porpoise Spit, the mythical town made famous by the film Muriel’s Wedding: an acrylic land of hoop earrings, dumb surfers and undone housewives burning down backyards.Cities have moods and boroughs, and things only locals know. They are at their best when they surprise when you sink in to the city and relate to it on its own terms. The Gold Coast has been allowed to be trashy, glitzy and even obscene, as long as it doesn’t gatecrash the VIP party – one smoky quartz slipper already dangerously close to the rope. In any case, this won’t be the city’s last renaissance.In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

A case in point, as has become sharply evident this week, is the much-vaunted “deconfliction” arrangement between Russia and Israel after the former entered the war in Syria on the side of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.Negotiated between Vladimir Putin and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, it was held up at first as evidence of the latter’s diplomatic skills – an arrangement that allowed Israel a free hand against weapons transfers from Iran to Hezbollah and maintained Israeli deterrence on its northern border.Over seven years, the civil war has dragged in multiple foreign nations, turning what started as a pro-democracy uprising into a quagmire of overlapping conflicts.Global powerhouses including Iran, Israel, Russia, Turkey, and the United States have all, to different extents, engaged their militaries in the conflict. At the same time, they have supported warring factions on the ground, including Iran-allied Hezbollah, Kurdish militia, and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces alliance. Islamic State and al-Qaida are also present.If that arrangement has for long looked very shaky, the reaction of Russia and Iran to Israeli strikes this week on an airbase in Syria, killing seven Iranian advisers, has brutally exposed the assumptions that underlie it, not least Moscow’s tolerance for Israel’s assumption of its freedom of action.The reality is that Israel – and Netanyahu in particular – has badly misread the trajectory of Russia’s re-engagement in the Middle East, which has created in the very kindest interpretation the context for Iran’s projection of its influence ever further west and ever closer to Israel’s borders.Why all this matters in the current febrile context following the latest alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria, is that Israel’s misjudgments sit at one corner of a dangerous matrix of unpredictability, perhaps unseen – as James Hohmann argued in the Washington Post – since the secretary of state Dean Acheson suggested in 1950 that Korea was outside the core defence perimeter of the US.On the American side that uncertainty around intentions has seen Donald Trump flip-flop so dramatically that in a handful of days he has somersaulted from suggesting first that his country was rushing for the exit on Syria to a situation where military strikes seem likely.In Israel, a wounded Netanyahu – who has built an entire political career on promising to be a bulwark against Iran – is now being confronted with his rhetoric and the consequence of his actions, not least his bloody public pricking of Iran in a way that Tehran may now find hard to discount.In the final corner there is Putin, whose calculations are opaque because that is his intention – not least over his ambitions and red lines.The result is a highly combustible situation in which no party to the conflict – direct or otherwise – can be certain of the assumptions that the others are operating under.All of which has created what Stephen Pinker describes in his illuminating book on violence and war, The Better Angels of Our Nature, as a classic “security” or “Hobbesian” dilemma, a situation where actions by a state ostensibly to heighten their security can prompt other states to act pre-emptively, risking a fugue of escalation. As more violence seems likely, what is also troubling is that the key mechanism for avoiding such an escalation – the UN security council – seems profoundly weakened by the further weaponisation of the US and Russian vetoes under both Trump and Putin.History teaches us that wars – from the first world war to Korea, the six-day war and the Falklands – are often fuelled by failures of messaging and interpretation.Looking around the Middle East today never has that felt more true. And never have wise heads been in such short supply.• Peter Beaumont is a Guardian reporter and former Jerusalem correspondent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1492e0e13c7dc32017a66fbc6e33bdd8e853eb6/628_1529_2880_1728/master/2880.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dc75e04c19daf1588f4fbce39f5ae99f 1240w","title":"tiny violins moaning pretty being beautiful blessing curse samantha brick","story":"Being beautiful mainly seems a blessing. But it can be a curse – and the main problem is that you are just not allowed to complain about itIt’s tough being beautiful. Other women, women who are not so genetically blessed, despise you, you see. They worry you will steal their husband. They get together with their average-looking friends and say nasty things behind your inordinately elegant back. They think that, just because you have flawless skin, you don’t have feelings. But you do have feelings: tragically, the world can’t look past your cut-glass cheekbones and understand that.If you have ever wondered What It’s Like to Go Through Life As a Really Beautiful Woman, this is about the sum of it, apparently. At least, according to an article published last week on New York magazine’s lifestyle website, the Cut. In it, an anonymous woman in her late 50s explains that being attractive opened a lot of doors for her in life, but also made women hate her. I’m fairly sure the beautiful-but-damned subject of the article wasn’t Samantha Brick, but it is very much reminiscent of her infamous 2012 magnum opus in the Daily Mail, There are Downsides to Looking This Pretty: Why Women Hate Me for Being Beautiful. And, like Brick’s much-laughed-at lament, it was immediately and mercilessly mocked on social media.Rightly so. The article reads like a parody, parroting tiresome tropes about jealous, catty women. Yet it’s a shame the response to the piece descended so swiftly into jeers. There is an interesting and important conversation to be had about what it’s like to go through life as a really beautiful woman – or a very handsome man. Looks aren’t everything, but count for a lot. We might not like to admit it, but we are all prone to treating people differently according to their appearance. Studies show that even babies prefer looking at more attractive faces. But while we are all affected by beauty biases, I’m not sure we are often prompted to examine and curb them – and they have real repercussions.But while beauty mainly seems to be a blessing, it can also be a curse. Being considered attractive works against you if you are a woman applying for a traditionally “masculine” job, for example. In 2015, a study from University College London’s School of Management found that while handsome men are seen as more competent, this makes them less likely to be hired in competitive workplaces because they are perceived as a threat. Funny, isn’t it? Despite there being clear evidence that men can be threatened by other men’s looks, they are rarely accused of same-sex jealousy in the way women are. It is almost as if society goes out of its way to pit women against each other.Ultimately, it seems that the main problem with being attractive is that people are not allowed to complain about it. As articles like the one in the Cut make clear, nothing brings out the sarcastic tiny violins faster than someone moaning about the pitfalls of aesthetic perfection. While that may be understandable, I think it is also worth understanding that society sometimes penalises prettiness. Let’s not be so quick to hate on people just because they write op-eds about being beautiful.It’s a big week for Mark Zuckerberg, who is appearing in front of Congress to apologise for inadvertently undermining democracy. Facebook reportedly prepared for this personal responsibility (PR) exercise by bringing in an army of experts to give its CEO a “crash course” in charm – a quality the ZuckBot is not known for.What does this charm curriculum comprise? If I happened to control a complex system of mass surveillance or was as good at hacking as certain Tory MPs, I would be able to tell you in detail. Sadly, this is not the case. So, I can only speculate that preparations kicked off with careful scrutiny of the personal data of all the politicians Zuck will be meeting. People like it when you ask them about themselves, Mark! Why not try asking that congressman – you know, the one who has been having a secret affair for the past three months – how he liked the new carbonara recipe he tried the other day?Facebook being Facebook, I imagine some fancy tech was involved in updating MZ’s interpersonal operating system. An empathy algorithm, perhaps, devised to recommend meaningful semantic structures that build a sense of genuine community. Or maybe there is proprietary communication code that prompts Zuckerberg to nod and say “yes” at regular intervals to make it seem as if he is actually listening and not just counting the minutes until he can escape from having to interact with mere mortals.Or maybe charm training was a little more analogue than that. Perhaps Zuckerberg was just advised to take off that unflattering T-shirt and wear a suit. Perhaps he was told to say the word “sorry” a statistically significant number of times. After all, if you repeat any old nonsense long enough, people will believe it. Facebook knows that better than just about anyone.One day you tweet a question about whether snakes fart, the next you’ve landed a book deal about animal flatulence. Well, Dani Rabaiotti knows how it is, anyway. Last year, the environmental scientist sent a tweet that turned into a viral hashtag (#doesitfart) that turned into a book called Does It Fart: the Definitive Field Guide to Animal Flatulence. This includes must-know information such as the fact that sloths don’t break wind. Meanwhile, seal farts smell like fish, while herrings use their liberated gas to communicate with each other, much like small children. The book only came out in the US last week, but it was released in Britain last year. I guess the UK is inordinately receptive to hot air."},{"url":null,"title":"mark zuckerbergs facebook hearing sham","story":"Now that the initial show trial is done, we need the real dealOn Tuesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was in the hot seat. Cameras surrounded him. The energy in the room – and on Twitter – was electric. At last, the reluctant CEO is made to answer some questions!Except it failed. It was designed to fail. It was a show designed to get Zuckerberg off the hook after only a few hours in Washington DC. It was a show that gave the pretense of a hearing without a real hearing. It was designed to deflect and confuse.Each senator was given less than five minutes for questions. That meant that there was no room for follow-ups, no chance for big discoveries and many frustratingly half-developed ideas. Compare that to Bill Gates’ hearing on Microsoft, where he faced lawyers and staff for several days, or the Kefauver hearings, which were over a year. By design, you can’t do a hearing of this magnitude in a day. The worst moments of the hearing for us, as citizens, were when senators asked if Zuckerberg would support legislation that would regulate Facebook. I don’t care whether Zuckerberg supports Honest Ads, or privacy laws, or GDPR. By asking him if he would support legislation, the senators elevated him to a kind of co-equal philosopher king whose view on Facebook regulation carried special weight. It shouldn’t.Facebook is a known behemoth corporate monopoly. It has exposed at least 87 million people’s data, enabled foreign propaganda, and perpetuated discrimination. We shouldn’t be begging for Facebook’s endorsement of laws, or for Mark Zuckerberg’s promises of self-regulation. We should treat him as a danger to democracy, and demand our senators get a real hearing.The best senators understood this was a show, and used it as such. “Your user agreement sucks,” said Senator John Kennedy. “Are you a monopoly?” asked Senator Lindsey Graham (Zuckerberg comically responded that he didn’t “feel” like it.) Senator Richard Blumenthal said we needed laws, not promises or apologies.Because each senator was limited to under five minutes, Zuckerberg tried to run the clock by talking about mission, or philosophy, or what he believed in. There were some good questions, but there was little chance for follow up. You could almost see him, well-trained to count the minutes, playing for time when things got a little hot. Senators Hironi and Booker, for instance, both pointed out the damning reporting by Julia Angwin at ProProblica, which showed that employers and landlords were using Facebook for discriminatory ads. Zuckerberg defended the company by saying they were hard to flag, and that they depend on community flagging to stop them. The tools Facebook provides make discrimination easy. Facebook has monopoly profit margins, so it could easily provide real staffing to protect against discrimination, if it wanted to. It doesn’t want to. Hironi and Booker could have shown that, but, like the rest of the senators, they each had only a few minutes for a line of questioning. Zuckerberg replied with vague answers about how their comments were “important” or “interesting” or “an important conversation to have”.Some of the hearing seemed designed to figure out whether Zuckerberg is a good or bad man, or whether he has a good or bad – or bizarre – political philosophy. Zuckerberg strikes me as reliably self-serving. That doesn’t make him that interesting as the CEO of a corporate monopoly it makes him a run-of-the-mill robber baron. Asking Zuckerberg philosophical questions, such as how he thinks we should deal with questions of hate speech, treat him as a thought leader. Accepting his failures to catch discriminatory housing ads, for instance, treats him as a good-hearted actor with limited resources, instead of someone who is making monopoly margins and billions in profits.In my view, we need to break up Facebook from Instagram and the other potential competitors that Facebook bought up. We need to – at a minimum – move towards opt-in, we need to hold Facebook responsible for enabling discrimination, and we need to require interoperability.But that’s not enough. There is so much we don’t know about Facebook. We know we have a corporate monopoly that has repeated serious violations that are threatening our democracy. We don’t know how their algorithm treats news organizations or content producers, how Facebook uses its own information about Facebook users or how tracking across platforms works, to just give a few examples. Now that the initial show trial is done, we need the real deal, one where no senator gets cut off after a few minutes.

Its buried are not men and women, but the carcasses of 13 nuclear submarines. Some have been dead for decades, such as the HMS Conqueror, which sank the Belgrano 36 years ago. Nine still have nuclear fuel rods, and there have been repeated leaks of radioactive waste. The Ministry of Defence claims all are safe. Then again, it sometimes doesn’t even disclose breaches until months later, when MPs and journalists have had to winch out the truth.All this runs true to local history. For nigh-on five decades, Devonport had its own Berlin Wall, with 50 acres of land walled up by the military. Complete with barbed wire running around the top, it was loathed by locals. It was only toppled in 2007. “The navy, the army, the air force: they come in, they do what they want, and take away the bits of the city they want for themselves,” says councillor Chris Penberthy, who grew up near the dockyard.“People do things to Plymouth,” he says. “Plymouth hasn’t often been allowed to do things for itself.” He is referring to the blitz, followed by the imposition of an Abercrombie city plan and the throwing up of shoddy housing. He also means the way in which well-meaning policy experts will today pitch up with some cash and pilot their brainwaves in Devonport and the impoverished west of the city. They come with a grand scheme to deal with household budgeting or child malnutrition and stay for a few months until the money runs out. Then they hurry off. A 60s baby, Penberthy grew up to the smell of Farley’s Rusks baking nearby. It joined Clarks’ shoes on a long rollcall of big local businesses. This is the Plymouth that residents liken to a northern mill town or a Welsh mining village. Just like them, the industry left decades ago. Just like them, it voted for Brexit.Representing the ward next door to Devonport, Penberthy sees ingrained deprivation in one of the richest countries in human history. Primary schools hold “brushing clubs” to help children look after their teeth, and “for some of those kids, aged eight or nine, it’ll be the first time they use a toothbrush”. Ahead of next month’s local elections, women on doorsteps say, “I vote how my husband tells me.” Families ripped off by the benefits office and bilked of desperately-needed cash for their disabled children sigh, “They must be right – they are the government.”What lends this even greater piquancy is Plymouth’s naval history, still celebrated in the breakfast rooms of a hundred lodging houses, with their paintings of Francis Drake on a bowling green. Before the dockyard became a radioactive burial ground, it employed tens of thousands of men. Today that figure is about 2,500.Post-industrial, post-imperial, post-Suez, Plymouth is no ordinary city it is a place where the furs in which Britain wraps itself are revealed as so many rags. Which makes what it does instead important not just locally but nationally. What it is doing is one of the most intriguing experiments I have seen in any British city. However far from perfect, it shows what can happen when a council tries to shape how business behaves in its backyard. It is what a city doing things for itself looks like. And it starts neither in the council chamber nor the city centre, but in a knackered hall in Devonport. Dotted across Devonport are the grand Regency buildings that remind visitors of its vast previous wealth and pre-1914 status as an independent town. Most imposing of all is the Guildhall, with its massive Doric pillars. By the mid-2000s, it had lain empty for years, being far too large for the now-shrunken local economy. Then, to councillors’ relief, along came a regional group called the Real Ideas Organisation (Rio).“The conversation began, ‘Do you think it needs to be a community centre, a business centre or an arts centre?’” recalls Rio chief executive Lyndsey Hall. “By the end, it was, ‘We don’t care what you do – just take it away.’” With a £1.75m grant, Hall did just that. Today, it’s not just a centre for community or business or arts: it’s all three – and more. “No one’s going to get rich out of running a building like this,” says Hall’s colleague Ed Whitelaw. “Why would any private company want to take it on?”But Hall and Whitelaw don’t run a standard business. Theirs is a social enterprise, a company that uses its profits and assets for public good. Rio derives an income from the Guildhall, but it doesn’t sweat the building for every last penny.To wander around the Guildhall is to see that ethos in action: the main hall with its stained-glass windows has just been vacated by a team of cheerleaders, and is let out for free to community groups. Other social enterprises rent office space and use the basement jail cells as meeting rooms. In the corner is a cafe and bakery.When the council met Rio in the late 2000s, social enterprises were still a novelty. Hall had been inspired by a visit to Toronto and seeing everything from supermarket chains to the giant Harbourfront arts centre operating as community businesses. But in the UK, social enterprises, or community interest companies, were only legally recognised in 2005. A product of fag-end Blairism, they came bearing that ideology’s virtues and vices: a desire to tackle age-old social problems in new ways and a bewildered wonderment at the magic that could somehow be worked by entrepreneurs. That haze hangs over the 2005 act, which establishes a watchdog for the new businesses – but says its “power should be exercised only to the extent necessary to maintain confidence in community interest companies”. As for how exactly communities were to be served by these companies – well, that was usually left for the companies themselves to define. Whether returning £10m or 10p to society – that’s up to them. “Some social enterprises we go, ‘brilliant, fabulous’,” says Rio’s Hall. “Other things named as social enterprises we go, ‘ugh’.”Yet consider the possibilities that a new form of entrepreneurship offers Plymouth, which faces the same huge challenge as numberless towns and cities across Britain and the west: how to get capital and power to stay local. One answer adopted by Chris Penberthy and the other Labour politicians voted in to lead the council in 2012 was to grow a different kind of business. The next year, Plymouth raced Bristol to become the first social enterprise city in the UK.“How do we grow our economy and grow ourselves a future? By finding companies who will do more than corporate social responsibility,” says Penberthy, who was put in charge of growing social enterprise in the city, a post then unknown to local government.“There was a lot of banging desks and ‘Do it now!’” recalls Alistair Macpherson, who worked at the council for years. In another municipal rarity, Penberthy set up a public fund to kickstart new social enterprises. More than largesse or political vision, this was a way for a local authority with dwindling budgets to fill in the gaps that big business wouldn’t touch.Those gaps are not just the dead buildings brought back to life by Rio, which is now at work on a £7m project to turn Devonport’s abandoned market hall into a high-tech centre for virtual reality. They’re also the solar farm that Macpherson built as head of Plymouth Energy Community on contaminated land next door to a bomb dump. And they’re in the city centre’s abandoned shops, such as the one now occupied by Moments Cafe which, as well as selling mugs of tea and ham omelettes, helps dementia sufferers and their carers. Run by nurse Kate Smith, the cafe’s staff has been trained to look out for memory problems or distress among customers.What drew Luke into the cafe was a sign reading “Memory Matters”. It was like a personal message. Last July, surgeons had removed a brain tumour by cutting out part of a lobe, and now he could no longer remember basic things, whether afternoon plans or people’s names. At the till he didn’t ask for a coffee: “I just wanted a number. A number for me to ring to speak about my memory.”Instead, Kate took him upstairs for a quiet chat – then it all came out. How the tumour meant he’d lost his building business and split from the mother of his four-year-old girl. How his head still hurt so much, despite all the heavy-duty meds. The attempts to kill himself. How the council had stuck him in a house-share with two other men, both threatening to beat him up. How he’d run away, with nowhere else to go. “I just bawled my eyes out,” says Luke, and not because of how much trouble he was in. “It was the acceptance from Kate. She listened and understood.”“You can’t leave him,” Smith remembers thinking to herself. “He’ll die.” So she lobbied council officers, drafted in support from Luke’s doctors, and got him a diary. Flip it open and the pages teem with Smith’s neatly written reminders to visit the hospital, phone the bank. It was a week’s work, reckons Smith. “And the rest,” laughs Luke. It paid off: he is now in a Travelodge while the council sorts out a permanent home. An amazing story, but it leaves you wondering why a just-opened cafe is picking up the pieces dropped by the NHS and the council – and whether tears over coffee and long hours ringing around a civic centre can ever form an actual business model. At the same time, it’s impossible to imagine such stories coming out of the mammoth Costa just a few doors down.Plymouth now has more than 150 social enterprises employing over 7,000 workers earning a combined income of over £500m. For a city of 250,000 people, which only adopted social enterprise five years ago, that’s remarkable growth. Even more surprising is the politics. Political control over Plymouth council changes only slightly less frequently than the tide, yet the Tory administration that took over in 2016 has also encouraged and funded social enterprise. If, as looks likely, Labour returns to power next month, it is committed to doubling the city’s co-operative economy by 2025. With neither side threatening to pull the plug, national charities such as Esmee Fairbairn and Power To Change have the security they need to plough millions into the city’s sector.To see what social enterprise could look like, walk 10 minutes west from Moments Cafe to yet another local graveyard. Once heaving with pubs and clubs, Union Street is now silent and shut. Yet inside The Clipper, once open all hours, Hannah Sloggett and Wendy Hart have plans to open a covered market and turn the two flats above into affordable homes for single fathers who lack the bedrooms for their visiting kids.I’m reminded of a remark from Rio’s Hall. “There was that moment on television when you’d have Alan Sugar doing The Apprentice and getting people to behave as badly as possible. Then an hour afterwards, it’d be The Secret Millionaire – with all these tycoons making people cry by giving them money out of the goodness of their hearts. “And that’s – that’s just wrong!” Her head crashes into her palms. “Why are we creating a culture where it’s OK to make money behaving as badly as possible in order for people to give it away? That’s the culture we’ve got to change. I don’t care whether it’s called social enterprise, or anything else.”Additional reporting by Tom Wright"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19947f4bcd6c7418621a575f904a74fb77f13bde/0_109_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5b6a9384f83d3338a2c84817ddf1bc73 1240w","title":"viktor orban aleksandar vucic europe eu","story":"The danger of leaders like Viktor Orbán and Aleksandar Vučić isn’t just ideology but the ruthlessness with which they exploit public opinionTwo weeks before securing his latest electoral victory, Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister, travelled to the northern Serbian town of Subotica to meet his close friend, Aleksandar Vučić, the president of Serbia. Outside the region, few people pay much attention to the bond between these two men. Yet overlooking it would be hazardous. A close look at this duo can reveal a lot about the nexus, in today’s Europe, between political engineering, nationalism, and how demagogues can thrive.Orbán and Vučić like each other because they have much in common, although one has made the EU an enemy while being part of it, while the other remains outside and aspires to join the club. They’re roughly of the same generation – one that entered politics in the turbulent era of the crumbling of the communist bloc. They both pander to nationalist sentiment, while toeing a fine line trying to preserve a functional relationship with important players within the EU – not least in Germany. And they are strongmen, with little interest indeed for checks and balances, liberal democracy or free media.But what is most fascinating – and also very telling of this particularly inchoate phase of European politics – is how Orbán and Vučić have managed to reinvent themselves spectacularly over the years. Their recipe for political survival and entrenchment lies in being perfect chameleons. They may infuse state-controlled television with constant ideology, but they hardly hold deep beliefs. Slogans are to them just a dress code that can be replaced, whenever convenient. They draw their strength from having a good nose for where the wind of public opinion may blow – and how that can best be exploited.Look at their careers. Orbán went from a late-1980s poster-child of democratic transition, to a trailblazer of Europe’s current national-populist nightmares. Vučić was once a staunch admirer of Serbia’s blood-drenched warlords in the 1990s Balkans, and at one point he joined Slobodan Milošević’s propaganda outfit as information minister. But by the 2010s, he had mutated into a seemingly reasonable, eager pro-European. He had well understood that dreams of a “Greater Serbia” had collapsed in national exhaustion and defeat.Just as Orbán had detected that Brussels’ attractiveness was waning and decided it was time to cast his political net elsewhere, Vučić saw opportunity in self-transformation. He tacked on to a formally pro-European course, while Orbán opted to go the other way. The directions seem opposite, but the motivation is the same: to secure power. To be sure, Machiavellian manoeuvring is hardly rare currency in politics. Orbán and Vučić are just good at it. But what matters here is the impact these shifts may have on Europe’s future – and whether there’s any possibility of further and perhaps altogether different shifts.These two men matter. Orbán’s Hungary is a magnet for the far right elsewhere on the continent. Serbia holds the key to the stability of the Balkans – a region that forms Europe’s strategic, vulnerable underbelly, and which Winston Churchill once described as “producing more history than it can consume”.In his book on Europe, Postwar, the historian Tony Judt played down the role of intellectual dissident groups in consolidating the 1989 revolutions of central Europe. He pointed, rather, to how “party functionaries and bureaucrats transformed themselves in a matter of months from nomenklatura yes-men to glib practitioners of pluralist party politics”.“Survival,” Judt wrote, “depended on recalibrating one’s allegiances.” “Market economy”, “democratisation” and “civil society” (or “Europe”, which encompassed all three) became the buzzwords. This is something Orbán himself experienced. In Yugoslavia, unlike in Hungary, things were different, because various populations were so intermingled. Nationalism became Milošević’s way of securing a hold on power. That’s a story Vučić became part of.So what about today? I happened to be in Belgrade shortly after Orbán and Vučić met in Subotica. The talk among politicians and civil society activists was all about passions flaring up again over Kosovo. Speculation ran high as to whether Vučić might choose to play on tensions in the region to recast himself as a territory-grabbing ultra-nationalist. It could be his way of compensating for a loss of personal legitimacy if EU membership prospects don’t materialise.Interestingly, there were also comments about Orbán’s interest in the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina (many of whom voted last Sunday, as dual citizens), where Subotica is located. The most pessimistic take I heard was this: that Orbán and Vučić will next engage in a game of revisiting borders, playing on Hungarian grievances about the 1920 treaty of Trianon and Serbian obsessions over Kosovo. For all the talk about democratic backsliding, ethnic and territorial questions may be the next looming crisis for Europe, as far-fetched as it may seem.The EU has only one tool to prevent such worst-case scenarios, which is to stick together and defend its principles by using its soft power of pressures and incitements. It needs to keep opportunist demagogues from giving way to their darkest temptations – and to act now. Remember, these are chameleons, they adapt to circumstance. Just as they changed their colour before, they might just change it again. The question is how."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e03bbd60797530ef17ee2396f14b22fc28f61e88/0_324_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4945b08b6e0b26b730216f5c6771747e 1240w","title":"rules working from home never wear pyjamas","story":"If you’re dressed for bed, your brain will think it’s bedtime. ‘Cheering’ tracksuit bottoms and slim-fit jumpers are far better for your home-working wardrobe, says our fashion guru in her weekly columnI’ve recently started to work from home. What should I wear?Sara, by emailAn excellent question and one I ask myself most days, because I generally work from home and while working from home does remove certain quandaries from your life – such as: “How long can I tolerate this commute until sweet death releases me?” and: “Sweet Jesus, how many times is Geoff from Accounts going to clear his throat, does he have a literal frog down there and, if so, can I go over and pull it out with my fist?” – others take their place. Nature, vacuum, etc.So while I no longer, thank goodness, have to endure the London tube every rush hour, I do find myself facing daily existential questions such as: “How do I stop myself from snacking from the fridge literally all goddamn day?” and: “If I’m not actually leaving the house, do I have to leave my bed?”Questions, questions. Clothing, of course, comes under this umbrella of new questions. Why bother to dress if you’re not going outside? To quote that famous philosophical saying, “If you wear an unironed shirt and no one sees it, was the shirt actually ironed?”The new homeworker tends to go through three phases with their clothes before settling down into something that works. The first is the pyjama phase, when you’re so excited about no longer having to go into an office that you celebrate by staying in your pyjamas for a day, three days, maybe five – what does it matter, right?But the thrill quickly wanes, partly because the postman starts giving you looks (and, as a homeworker, you will now be the drop-off depot for all of your neighbours’ Amazon, Asos, Argos, Ikea, Boots and John Lewis deliveries, so you will see an awful lot of your postman). But mainly because it starts to feel gross. Working in your pyjamas is a lot like working from bed (and the two often go together): it seems like such a great idea when you start, but you realise that if you’re dressed for bed, your brain will thinks it’s bedtime and totally fuzz out. So, not pyjamas is the first rule of homeworking.The next phase is when you react against pyjamas by dressing up – as if you’re going to work. This works for some people. Putting on a suit or smart dress gets them in the work mindset, I guess. I have a friend who likes to work from home in party dresses, as they make her feel like she is a) on it and b) having fun, even though she is sitting in her living room and knocking out more advertising copy.And that’s great – give that a go, see if it works for you. It absolutely never did for me. It just felt silly, as if I was some pathetic character in a movie, possibly one directed by the Coen brothers, who had been sacked and now sat at home in his suit, pretending nothing had happened.So, as I tend to do in all things, I go for the middle option (#centristhomeworker) and dress in clothes that are as comfortable as pyjamas but aren’t actually pyjamas. For me, this means cheering tracksuit bottoms, T-shirts, and slim-fitting jumpers. What do I mean by “cheering tracksuit bottoms”? Glad you asked! Ones that are not shapeless and depressing, but fit nicely, are colourful, and maybe even have rainbow stripes down the side. Asos.com is your answer here, and as you now work from home you’ll be there to accept its deliveries. I find that wearing a slim-fitting jumper – not a massive baggy thing that flops annoyingly over your hands when you’re typing – makes the tracksuit feel a little smarter so your brain doesn’t go into fuzz-out mode.As a kid, when I imagined my adult life, I sort of imagined myself as dressing like Melanie Griffith in Working Girl, striding around in a skirt suit. Instead, I sit around at home all day in a tracksuit. And because I’m such an adult, I’m good with that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caadf5acdd0c474aa110c72fcfb8c50056ca8156/0_185_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2d2190d4084e47ec1f05e57cc734cf51 1240w","title":"its not a miracle its something bigger italian press hails roma win","story":"The Italian newspapers were full of praise for Roma after their win over Barcelona, with Corriere dello Sport giving every player 10 out of 10Not even in a moment of shared exhilaration could Italy’s football writers find consensus. “Miracles, in football, do exist,” ran the opening line of La Repubblica’s match report for Roma’s Champions League triumph over Barcelona. Corriere della Sera had a different take. “This isn’t a miracle,” wrote Luca Valdiserri. “It’s something bigger than that.”The front pages told their own story, Gazzetta dello Sport hailing a new Roman empire, while Corriere dello Sport declared that this Roma would go down in legend. Wittier might have been the cover of France’s L’Equipe, which played off Barcelona’s “Remuntada” against Paris Saint-Germain last season to define this instead as a “Romantada” instead (though variations on the gag were already doing the rounds last night …).“Maybe impossible is only a mental construction,” pondered La Repubblica’s Maurizio Crosetti. “Maybe it’s a limit that men put on themselves to fight fear … In 90 minutes, the grand narrative of us and them: we, the poor fallen Italians and they the rich Spanish – masters of technique, tactics and finance – were reduced to ashes. Lies, because only the pitch can tell us a story worth listening to. It is written by people, not algorithms.”Of course, it was these same newspapers who had been pushing the inferiority narrative just 24 hours before. Monday’s Gazzetta featured a two-page spread illustrating countless ways in which Spanish football had left the Italians behind, from on-pitch success through to sponsorship deals and social media following. Luigi Garlando reminded us of that context in his editorial for the pink paper on Wednesday.“Roma turn over Barcelona and burst triumphantly into the semi-finals, in the face of bank balances, academy systems, tiki-taka and Messi’s five Ballon d’Ors. We are still alive, there will be a little bit of Italy among the best four teams in Europe. Three goals against the legendary armada who rewrote the rules of modern football and who have won three of the last 10 Champions Leagues.“A night which will become history, epic and to be retold as such. There were Romans (De Rossi) and Greeks (Manolas), there was that giant Dzeko who put Roma on his shoulders like Anchises did with his son Aeneas. Messi might have sanctified the idea of the ‘false nine’, but when a ‘true nine’ does everything that Edin did yesterday, with or without the ball, with strength or with his touch, by running or standing still, it’s a joy for the eyes, the glorification of football.”Dzeko was singled out for praise across the board, his decision not to leave for Chelsea in January celebrated anew. “He harpoons balls and turns them into nightmares,” was the verdict accompanying his nine out of 10 in La Repubblica’s player ratings. “A goal, a penalty, a thousand other things.”Corriere dello Sport could not bring themselves to rank any Roma player higher than another, instead awarding every one of them 10 out of 10. The manager, though, merited, a special mention, as did the people in the stands. “This was an authentic masterpiece by Di Francesco, who did not make a single mistake,” wrote Alessandro Vocalelli. “He earned with full marks the right to be considered a manager of an exceptional international level. But this was also, and above all, the great victory of the fans, who dragged Roma on against the Spanish superstars, as well as against a referee who tried to block the way with an endless series of back-to-front decisions.” In Turin, they hoped that this result could serve as an example to Juventus, who need a miracle of their own at the Bernabéu after losing 3-0 at home to Real Madrid. “To believe is a bit stupid, in the circumstances,” wrote Guido Vaciago in a front-page editorial. “But to believe is also a moral duty, given the feat pulled off against Barcelona by an enormous and moving Roma.”More broadly, there was hope that this most defiant of victories could serve as a new rallying point for football in a country still recovering from its failure to qualify for the World Cup. “Thank you Roma, thank you Di Francesco, thank you for this example,” added Sebastiano Vernazza in Gazzetta. “Si, se puede. Yes, we can.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25d227c0f56aa02b19f52bda1aad6678f94afc72/370_14_1175_705/master/1175.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=aeee67bd1d70d97a6c328c5ff1e69d14 1240w","title":"chris coleman seinfeld sunderland","story":"If we had to slap a name on this era in football, we could do worse than the Rise of the Quants. These days, there is a widespread belief that even the mascot needs to have read Moneyball, and not simply be able to critique the movie. The biggest clubs employ armies of data analysts, while advanced metrics and tactical analytics are the adornment of increasing amounts of commentary. Privately, you might think some of your friends speak the language of football statistics much as Andy Gray once spoke the language of Spanish, when he inquired of a La Manga hotel receptionist: “Eh senoreo, where’s the fucking taxio?” But like Andy, they certainly have a go, and forcefully so.In this occasionally stifling and frequently deeply boring atmosphere, it’s refreshing to hear of idiosyncratic tactical approaches. All respect to Chris Coleman, then, who this week gave the media a glimpse into his forward planning. “We just need to look and see what’s happened in the last five years,” the Sunderland manager explained, “and then do the opposite.”Obviously, Coleman was not being completely serious but there was something cheerily liberated about his comments. Liberation is what he is aiming for, what with Sunderland trapped in the Championship relegation zone. Perhaps Chris will turn out to be a counterculture hero – football’s equivalent of The Diceman, the protagonist of Luke Rhinehart’s cult anti-analysis novel, who makes all his decisions on the throw of a dice.An even closer analogue to the Sunderland manager’s “do the opposite” approach exists. There’s a Seinfeld episode called The Opposite, where George Costanza bemoans what feels like a lifelong losing streak. “It became very clear to me sitting out there today,” he tells Jerry and Elaine, “that every decision I’ve ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat … It’s all been wrong.”“If every instinct you have is wrong,” reasons Jerry, not entirely reasonably, “then the opposite would have to be right.” George duly decides to fight his natural impulses and see what happens, and is immediately rewarded when a beautiful woman agrees to a date, despite the fact he introduced himself to her with the words: “I’m unemployed and live with my parents.”As Coleman freely admits, this will basically be Sunderland’s approach to potential new signings – we’ve got a wantaway owner and you need to take a guess what ision we’ll be playing in next season.It’s not just fictional sitcom characters failing to give absolute primacy to tactical science, though – real football people are at it too. A year or so ago, the former Borussia Mönchengladbach coach Dieter Hecking let daylight in on magic when he said tactics were important “but you must not make any secret science out of it”. Many of the secrets that observers scientifically ined each week were quite beyond him. “Today there are even websites, presenting alleged thoughts of us coaches after the game,” Hecking marvelled. “I have read them once after a Wolfsburg game. I was wondering: ‘Am I supposed to have come up with these highly complex things?’”Soon after, the German FA’s head of coaching education, Frank Wormuth, declared tactics “overrated” and less important than the quality of players. Wormuth compared the fetishisation of modern tactical analysis to some pretentious art exhibition preview, “where people are seized by a canvas with colour patches, wondering what the painter wanted to tell them, and afterwards pay a lot of money for it. What did the painter want to tell us? Nothing. Perhaps he had just had a bad day.”At the England level, we are always encouraged to believe we have come a long way technically in the past 25 years or so. At the start of our journey, horrified documentary viewers were able to watch Graham Taylor’s tactical plan unfold as he judged a game was “made for Wrighty”, or bellowed rhetorically: “Can we not knock it?” At the end of our journey, we were deep in the realms of the FA elite development director Dan Ashworth’s spreadsheets. And yet, looking at England’s last major tournament exit to Iceland, you could be forgiven for thinking we had perhaps not journeyed anywhere at all but were simply knowing the place for the first time.As for Coleman’s do-the-opposite dossier, how might it pan out? I’m not sure if one is permitted to run so-called spoilers to Seinfeld episodes – the other day a chap wrote crossly to me saying I’d spoiled a plot point of Return of the Jedi (1983) for him, because he’d only got up to Star Wars: A New Hope (1977).But let’s live dangerously: at the end of The Opposite, George gets a coveted sporting job of his own, hired by the New York Yankees. The next episode opens with him offering batting advice and, though it’s not explicitly clear this is the continuation of do-the-opposite policy, George promptly approaches management with a creatively destructive scheme. The Yankees, he says, would be advantaged by switching from playing in polyester uniforms to cotton. Unfortunately, the cotton kits shrink, the Yankees end up running like penguins, and … well, spoilers.

It is tale of determination, how, as a teenager from Gafsa, in south-west Tunisia, on the edge of the Sahara desert, he realised his dream of becoming a footballer, and now, having earned his stripes in the non-league game, he is carving out a reputation as a manager.A gregarious character, Maamria, a former striker for Stevenage and the former assistant manager under Graham Westley, makes compelling company over an hour’s conversation, much of which revolves around his unorthodox journey to England, including how Brian Miller, the former Burnley scout on holiday at the time, offered him a two-week trial after spotting him playing against Étoile Sportive du Sahel, a team from Sousse, a tourist resort in the north.Maamria was playing for La Marsa, near Tunis, on the back of another trial, afforded to him after a lorry driver parking up overnight at the nearby wheat factory scribbled his name on the back of a matchstick box. “I was playing, bare feet as a 15- or 16-year-old. Somebody approached me and said: ‘Can I have your name please?’” He has not looked back since arriving at Turf Moor 23 years ago.“From a very young age, I wanted to be a footballer,” he says. “My teacher would have a go at me for saying that because they thought I should be a doctor or something. When I told people I was going to be a footballer, they laughed. I get it, those people who said I had no chance, because at that time there was no chance to go from the desert to the city – to be at one of the top clubs, it was impossible.”The youngest of seven siblings – he has five brothers and one sister – his upbringing was tough (they would run the 20-mile round trip to school in Lalla) – but one of which he is proud. “I came from a very poor background, I was born in a tent … but there is no shame in that. I lived in a tent until I was four, so that tells you where I have come from. We used to share a bed, my brothers and me, we would top and tail. Yes, I was poor but I loved it and I wouldn’t swap it for the world.“As a boy, I lived in a tent with a couple of goats, and one of them I used to call Gary, because of Gary Lineker. It is normal to have goats or camels in the south of Tunisia, where it’s very dry and they can survive the heat and go without drinking for days. We would use the goat’s milk for breakfast. Leo now, my little boy, I tell him about the story and he always says: ‘Daddy I want a goat for my birthday.’ I take him and my daughter, Maya, home every year to see my family and all the rest of it.”His late father, Youssef, worked in the phosphate mines – “a dangerous job that did not pay a lot” – but it was a conversation he overheard between his mother, Zara, and a neighbour, a couple of weeks before his baccalaureate exams, that spurred him. “They asked: ‘Why is he not studying and revising like everybody else?’ My mum said: ‘He is going to be a footballer.’ My neighbour laughed at her, I always remember that and that gave me that drive.”Maamria has always been captivated by football, inspired since he was a seven-year-old hearing history on the radio from the 1978 World Cup, Tunisia’s maiden appearance in the finals. His bold smile broadens as he rattles off their results with pride, particularly that 0-0 draw with West Germany. “We played on dirt tracks, wherever we could, with rocks either side – that was our goals. Tunisia is a third-world country but we are obsessed with football. North Africa is mad about football: Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Egypt, there is a big rivalry. Growing up, they were big games. It’s good Tunisia have got England, 18 June … I am ready for that already.”Maamria is adamant he is more famous in the UK than in his homeland and admits that, while he has embraced the culture, England has “looked after” him, he says with sincerity. “I remember the first time I came to Burnley,” Maamria says, breaking into laughter. “Back then in England if you go for a drink, you go to a pub. In Tunisia there is a coffee culture but in Burnley everywhere was shut at 5pm. I was like: ‘What is going on here, it is 5pm, and for us it is just the start of the evening.’ So, I had to go to the pub to have a cup of coffee and people were looking at me funny.”A thirst to learn meant Maamria started his coaching badges in his mid-20s while out with a broken leg at Burnley. He worked with Jay Rodriguez and Richard Chaplow, all the time improving his language skills. After Northwich Victoria, Southport and Nuneaton Town – whom he left to return to Stevenage last month – Maamria is relishing his fourth manager’s job and the task at hand at a club 15th in League Two. “I am quite proud because I am probably the first African and the first Muslim to be a manager in the Football League. I am proud of that, but I am not going to sit on that, I want to kick on as well.”• How much better can it get for Fulham or Millwall, 20 and 16 games unbeaten respectively?

He explains how he created a career out of nothing, and how it may be coming to an early endIt wasn’t easy being the biggest record collector in Cluj, says 65-year-old Rodion Rosça. The Romanian authorities would keep files on you, search your mail, make your business their business. Worse still was the suspicion that fell on anyone daring to grow their hair or wear some version of western fashion.“Romania was a village country, you know what I mean?” he says. “There were a lot of peasants living in villages, who were working in the Securitate and Politia. They did not like the students and the people who were following the fashions like long hair. Also they were very angry against the people in the cities. They only liked folk music. And they were very, very angry against the people who were listening to other kinds of music. A lot of parents made the mistake of cutting the hair of their sons when they were sleeping – a big trauma for young people. This was the reason for lots of crime made by children against their parents. This is a fact. They made a very big mistake cutting the hair of some people. There were people who committed suicide.”Rosça wasn’t just a record collector, he was a musician. As Rodion GA – “Romania’s first one-man band,” as he calls it – he recorded several albums’ worth of extraordinary music in the late 1970s and the 80s, giving up in 1989 after the death of his mother, Rozalia. Rodion GA managed to be prog, psychedelia, metal, electronica, often in the same song. Despite Rosça being Cluj’s leading record collector, Rodion GA sounds like he learned about music from hearing someone describe it in their second language, drunk. It sounds like nothing else: wrong in all the right ways. A clip on YouTube – said to have been broadcast on New Year’s Eve 1982 – is a good example. It shows Rosça and the band he had recruited on what appears to be a Romanian light entertainment show. Men in jackets, ties and moustaches dance with their frilly-bloused girlfriends to a song that begins with a synth fanfare before a martial drum roll introduces hugely distorted powerchords.Rosça learned music as a child, but Rodion GA’s peculiar sound owed more to his experiments with electronics, which were the result of necessity: in a country where consumer goods were a rarity, Rosça had to learn the skills to improvise in making and repairing equipment (“There is no loudspeaker in the world that I cannot repair. I made coils, I made cones from paper, and replacement parts”) and in recording himself with a Tesla two-track reel-to-reel recorder. He was writing songs on guitars and began recording them in 1975. “A lot of people said I am mad, and from madman came mad music,” he says. “I was not a good instrument player, but for me it was very important to record my ideas. The main reason to record my music was to memorise my songs. Then, I am very, very selfish, and this selfish attitude made me want to fight against the other groups and conquer them. It was a competition. The third reason is that I suffer from grandomania, and when I made a very nice song I was so excited, and this made me each time make another song.” I never wrote lyrics against the regime. Why? Because my mother had already lost two children and I was the only one left for herA few of his songs were released on compilations on the state record label, Electrecord. And though there were no singles, Rosça says he had No 1 songs based on radio play. “My mother was so happy that her boy at last was recognised. When she found that the radio station was transmitting my music, she dressed herself and went to the neighbours and told them: ‘Today my boy will sing on the radio! Listen at five o’clock! He’s the best in Romania!’” The latest Rodion GA collection, Rozalia, is a memorial to his mother, decided on after he went to visit her grave and found the headstone gone. “This cemetery stole my mother’s gravestone. Can you imagine what a trauma it was for me? Going to my mother’s grave with flowers and I find another name. I have to buy another one.”In 1971, Ceaușescu’s July Theses demanded culture be focused on celebrating national values. To ensure they were acceptable to the state censors, many Romanian musicians, Rosça among them, would use pre-existing approved poetry as their lyrics. “We never had problems with the authorities singing this music because I never used lyrics against the regime. Why? Because my mother had two children and she lost them and I was the only one left for her. My goal was not to put my life in danger and to destroy my mother. Fighting against the regime was not possible for me.” For his own lyrics, he says, “there was an organisation that supervised permission to sing songs. We had to write down lyrics three times for approval.”By 1979, Rodion GA was sufficiently popular that Rosça formed a band to perform live (more than 30 musicians were part of the group over the following decade one sacked member was so furious at his treatment that he denounced Rosça to the Securitate). Before they played, he says, “each listener imagined we are a very, very powerful group with a lot of instruments, like Grand Funk Railroad. But it was very hard to achieve this sound live, because it was necessary to have two synthesisers, two solo guitars, but we had no two guitars and no two synthesisers.”He remembers an appearance at a festival in the seaside resort of Costinești, where the reality of performing to a live audience butted up against his imagination of what playing shows would be like. “While we were singing I was expecting the people to shout like when the stars are singing. But this did not happen. And I was very, very, very distraught. Somehow I felt this was a total fiasco. The people were clapping their hands and they liked it. But they were not shouting. I began to sweat, and I was very nervous. After we finished playing, the bass guitarist came to me: ‘Rodi, it was very good!’ he said. I thought, ‘How can you tell it was good? The people were angry that we were not playing nice music, they were not impressed.’ ‘No, Rodi, you are wrong! They were fascinated by this music and they were listening. The people had never heard this kind of sound and they were listening.’”When Rozalia died in 1989, Rosça was heartbroken – “I have no reason for things” – and couldn’t see the point in carrying on. There were other reasons, too, familiar to scores of musicians. “We got not enough money from this activity. It was not nice, so I had no reason to continue.” He regrets giving up now – “It was one of the big mistakes of my life. I stopped playing music when I was the best” – but he has been delighted by the interest in his music since it began to be compiled and released in 2013. Before the Rozalia compilation were the albums The Lost Tapes and Behind the Curtain, and the soundtrack Misiunea Spațială Delta (Delta Space Mission).There have been comeback gigs, too. But the career of Rodion GA seems likely to peter out, even as it has been revived. “It’s a pity to tell you now that I have cancer,” he says. “I have tumour on my liver, but the doctors were not sure if it was malignant. Today they have found out that the tumour on my liver is cancer. I am very, very sad now.” There’s no way to answer that, other than to mumble condolences. And to reflect inwardly what a loss to music it is that someone can be lost, found and then lost again so soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1354e6722e5d64f06234e94fc5455a27a8a842f7/0_0_6211_3727/master/6211.jpg?w=6000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1107848ad701d780d22d762227155593 12000w","title":"commonwealth uk brexit leaving eu","story":"As director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, I know what this institution does – and the notion that it can pick up the slack when the UK leaves the EU is nonsense. By  Philip Murphy‘So, Professor Murphy,” said the voice at the end of the line. “What does the Commonwealth mean to you?” It was 2014, and I had agreed to do a live interview about the Commonwealth for a radio talk show. Media interest had been sparked by the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, and while I waited, phone in hand, for my turn to speak, the presenter was busily soliciting Commonwealth-related thoughts from anyone he could find on Glasgow’s streets that morning.Finally, just as the clock was ticking towards the very end of the show, the presenter turned his attentions to me. But I was stumped by the question. What does the Commonwealth mean to me? It was only since I had become director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies (ICwS) a few years earlier that it had “meant” anything much at all. And what was that meaning? Lots of drinks receptions in the hollowed-out citadels of Britain’s former imperial power? Endless well-meaning conferences exploring how the Commonwealth could achieve its “true potential”?In the three-and-a-half seconds while all this was racing through my head, the presenter correctly anticipated that a cheery anecdote would not be forthcoming, and moved on to the more concrete question: “What does the Commonwealth actually do?” I blurted out something spectacularly feeble along the lines of: “Well, it doesn’t do very much, but then it doesn’t cost very much.” And that was it – straight into the 10 o’clock news and traffic roundup. Not my finest hour.With the Commonwealth Games taking place at the moment and the biennial Commonwealth heads of government meeting opening in London next week, my institute will again be fielding a high volume of press enquiries. And this time, I’ll be ready for the “What does it mean to you?” question. Back in 2014, I wasn’t. But it was a variant of another question that I had regularly been asked in the five years since I became director of the ICwS: “How did you become interested in the Commonwealth?” There was always an assumption that some element of my upbringing or family history must have sparked my interest in this unique organisation, one that is very largely made up of former parts of the British empire. It currently has 53 members, including Britain itself, which range in size from India, with a population of more than 1.3 billion people, to the tiny Pacific island states of Tuvalu and Nauru, with populations of about 11,000 and 13,000 respectively. But there was nothing I could really point to. I grew up in Hull. Very occasionally we did go overseas on family holidays – but only to the Isle of Man. I can’t remember anyone even mentioning Commonwealth Day while I was at school in the 1970s and 80s. Had they been fee-paying public schools, where a good smattering of the families would probably have had records of imperial service, the situation might have been different. But they most decidedly were not.Later, as a postgraduate student studying how the Conservative party reacted to the decolonisation of Africa, I became familiar with the idea of the Commonwealth as a great, soothing comfort blanket for the party’s dwindling band of post-second world war imperial enthusiasts. They could reassure themselves that the sad business of granting independence to British colonies wasn’t really the end of the line. Like the souls of the faithful departed, these countries would simply join the heavenly throng of the Commonwealth and live in eternal peace and harmony.For the next 20 years or so, insofar as I thought about the Commonwealth, it was largely as a relatively minor aspect of British foreign policy. During the postwar period, the organisation had moved from being seen as an essential prop of Britain’s “great power” status to representing a puzzle, then an irritant, and finally a constant source of disappointment. It has maintained a loyal band of supporters, mostly concentrated in a series of London-based affiliated organisations. Yet even they often seem unable to provide any very convincing reasons for their enthusiasm.Suddenly, people started to talk about the Commonwealth again. The trouble was that most of what they were saying was nonsense.In the weeks after Britain voted for Brexit, as I tried to come to terms with what seemed to me an unmitigated disaster, there were always sympathetic friends on hand to make matters worse. “You’re at the centre of things now,” they said. “You must be very busy. Apparently the Commonwealth is the way of the future.” To which, as the director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, my response was: “If the Commonwealth is the future, then we’re in even more trouble than I thought.”Despite the leave campaign’s best efforts to turn the Commonwealth into a symbol of Britain’s ability to stand on the international stage independently of the EU, its power and influence has long been on the wane. Just a year before the Brexit referendum, the party manifestos for the UK general election reflected the Commonwealth’s diminished importance. In place of Labour’s 1997 vow to give renewed priority to this “unique network of contacts linked by history, language and legal systems”, the party now barely mentioned it. The Conservatives were a little more forthcoming, although they largely cut and pasted the words from their 2010 document. Ukip, predictably, scattered in references far more frequently than anyone else. Yet even they had dropped a startlingly ambitious proposal that had featured in its 2010 manifesto, to establish “a Commonwealth Free Trade Area” with the other Commonwealth countries.So, how exactly did it manage to shuffle its way back into the political conversation? For the leave campaign, depicting the Commonwealth as a huge potential trading opportunity for the UK was a useful fiction. This was reassuring mood music for a campaign keen to demonstrate that Britain would not be left helpless and isolated after Brexit. Yet beyond a few hand-me-down figures about its supposed economic potential, there were few clues about how or why the volume of trade with Commonwealth member states would be increased.Although the Commonwealth featured as an element in the snake oil sold to voters by the leave campaign, it was by no means the most potent ingredient. Indeed, many Brexiters struggled with the whole concept of the Commonwealth. On the one hand, it fed into their arguments that Britain had the opportunity to engage more actively with growing economies outside the EU. But it also sat uneasily within a campaign that had focused sharply on the issue of immigration.Once the result was announced, some of Britain’s most prominent Commonwealth enthusiasts began celebrating. Less than a week after the vote, the Daily Telegraph carried an article by David Howell, then chairman of the Royal Commonwealth Society, under the headline “A bright future awaits Britain post-Brexit in the Commonwealth markets”. It rehearsed a series of arguments that had been regularly trotted out for two decades, including the idea of a “Commonwealth advantage” in terms of the ease and cost of trade, and the notion that the world’s future growth areas would be outside the EU: “It is to Asia, Africa and Latin America we need to look for the big prizes, and the Commonwealth network is the gateway to many of these fast-growing new economies,” Lord Howell wrote.Given the ever more certain prospect that we will, indeed, leave the EU, it is worth looking closely at whether there is anything to this view. The origins of Howell’s argument go back to a brief and not very well-substantiated 1994 article by the Australian scholar Katherine West, titled “Britain, the Commonwealth and the Global Economy”, which was published in the the Commonwealth Journal of International Affairs. The piece began with the proposition that, for the UK, Europe had “become an economic black spot, with double-digit unemployment and the lowest rates of growth in the developed world”. It suggested that the British government’s “Eurocentric political rhetoric” tended to disguise the importance to Britain of markets outside the EU. West then moved to note “the spectacular economic growth” of Asian markets, suggesting again that “myopic concentration” on Europe on the part of British policymakers was an impediment to the exploitation of these markets.Tony Blair’s New Labour government, which took office in May 1997, initially seemed keen to run with this idea. The UK was about to host a Commonwealth heads of government meeting for the first time in 20 years, and the idea of the Commonwealth as an instrument to promote British trade seemed a useful way of fitting this rather creaking institution into New Labour’s modernising agenda.This new commercially minded love affair between the Blair government and the Commonwealth was, however, fairly shortlived. In the short term, Blair himself seemed disillusioned from virtually his first sight of the Commonwealth in action, irritated by the drawn-out and inconclusive nature of the Edinburgh Commonwealth heads of government meeting. In the longer term, and particularly after 911, Blair’s attentions focused on Anglo-American relations and the Middle East.Nevertheless, it was clear that promoting the notion of the Commonwealth as an under-utilised business asset was a way of persuading the British government to take it seriously. During the next two decades, bodies such as the Royal Commonwealth Society, the Commonwealth Business Council and the Commonwealth Secretariat pushed the idea vigorously. In particular, they suggested that there was a “Commonwealth effect” that rendered intra-Commonwealth trade cheaper and easier – an idea that can be traced directly to West’s 1994 article.These figures are now regularly rehearsed at Commonwealth gatherings, but there has been little objective analysis of this report, and we might well be cautious in reading too much into them. First, as the study notes, there are wide variations in the extent to which inidual Commonwealth countries trade with others. For some, the proportion is relatively low. The UK and Canada are mentioned in this context as countries “positioned close to large non-Commonwealth markets”. By contrast, there are other member states, including Singapore and Malaysia, that enjoy greater geographical proximity to major Commonwealth trading partners, and so conduct a much higher proportion of intra-Commonwealth trade. Given this, and the fact that there are huge variations in the levels of trade conducted by inidual member states, it is difficult to see what we can actually learn from an average figure for “Commonwealth advantage” between two notional Commonwealth states.It is worth noting, too, that in the run-up to the referendum, Commonwealth member states were virtually as one in wishing Britain to remain part of the EU. Behind this uncharacteristic outbreak of unanimity is the simple fact that Brexit throws the UK’s future trading relationships into confusion. The working assumption is that the current EU agreements, which allow many developing Commonwealth countries access to the UK market on advantageous terms, will lapse in Britain at the moment that Brexit takes effect. It will only be after that point that the UK has the legal capacity to negotiate trade agreements independently of the EU.This means many less-developed Commonwealth countries that currently conduct a significant proportion of their trade with the UK risk being hit by an immediate tariff hike. Given the finite resources available to the UK government for complex trade negotiations, and that attention is likely to be focused on the more lucrative markets of Europe, Asia and North America, Commonwealth countries quite reasonably fear that they will be a relatively low priority for Brexit Britain. The UK is also a major contributor to the EU aid budget, from which many Commonwealth countries benefit, and British overseas dependencies face the prospect of losing access to this important source of development funding altogether.In October 2010, Michael Ancram – then the former Conservative shadow foreign secretary – published a pamphlet setting out a new agenda for British foreign policy. The document, titled Farewell to Drift: A New Foreign Policy for a Network World, showed the influence of David Howell’s worldview: the forces of globalisation were steadily undermining the significance of old-fashioned power blocs such as the EU. Conversely, the Commonwealth, with its lack of treaty or constitution and its emphasis on collaboration and mutual support, was “a readymade vehicle for positive action”.“For too long the Commonwealth has been under-funded and underappreciated by many of its members, including the UK,” Ancram wrote. “For us it costs only 20p per person per year, while the EU costs £52 per person per year. It urgently needs, with British help, encouragement and involvement to become a bolder organisation that recognises its own strengths. It could have associate members as well as new members indeed some of the giants of the world like Japan could become interested, especially if it is based in the emerging powerhouse of India. It is in our interest to encourage such countries to become involved in the Commonwealth in one way or another.”During the 2016 referendum campaign, Ancram duly pinned his colours firmly to the leave mast. His encomium nicely encapsulated many elements of the British myth of the Commonwealth. This includes the tension between wishing to use the organisation more effectively, and disavowing any wish to lead it. Ancram was not the first Commonwealth enthusiast to recommend moving its headquarters to India, the most populous member state – but, more than seven years since the publication of his pamphlet, that prospect is no less remote. With many members of India’s policymaking elite seeing the Commonwealth as little more than a quaint relic of British imperialism, there is little chance of them offering it this sort of flag of convenience. There was also something familiar in Ancram’s ambiguous contrast between the supposed 20p cost of the Commonwealth, against the EU’s £52. Were we supposed to conclude that the Commonwealth is better value for money, or simply that it is under-resourced?Commonwealth enthusiasts generally want to have it both ways: the Commonwealth has supposedly vast potential (thus the idea of Japan joining as an associate member), which could be augmented further with a little additional funding, yet membership will always remain cheaper than the EU, and not only in terms of the UK’s direct financial contribution. Somehow, this mythical Commonwealth of the future will cost less than the EU in terms of the vast number of hours required to negotiate its treaties and other formal agreements it will not require members to make significant concessions in return for some collective good and it will have only the most rudimentary of mechanisms to enforce its will.In this light, the Commonwealth is the international relations equivalent of a homeopathic remedy – a cadre of staff so small as to be almost invisible when dissolved across a body comprising 2.4 billion people, which nevertheless does or could achieve miraculous results. But the promise of the Commonwealth can be seen in another, arguably far more realistic way. It is based on the prospect offered by charlatans and quacks throughout the ages – that of something for nothing.In the decades since the second world war, the process of devising and agreeing mechanisms for European cooperation has indeed been time-consuming and expensive. But it has resulted in a series of concrete achievements, above all the creation of the world’s largest free-trading bloc. Decisions made at an EU level affect the texture of daily life in its member states in the way that the Commonwealth’s empty pronouncements do not. As a result, any contemporary survey of international relations since 1945 is likely to devote considerable space to the EU and little or none to the Commonwealth. Frankly, the EU matters, in a way that the Commonwealth does not.This has long been apparent to those within the UK government who engage directly with the Commonwealth. It is far less obvious, however, to the vast majority of people in the UK, who know the organisation largely through occasional high-profile events such as the Commonwealth Games, and through the annual round-robin delivered in the Queen’s speech. It is at this level, and in this specifically British context, that the myth of the Commonwealth is arguably most dangerous. It encourages perceptions of the organisation as some sort of genuine global network with the UK at its centre, the other members ready to fall into line and embrace the prodigal mother whenever Britain finally decides that it is time to resume a guiding role.It was this combination of a widespread unfamiliarity with how the modern Commonwealth actually functions, and a lingering sense that it is in some way a special asset to the UK, that allowed some in the leave camp to present it during the 2016 referendum campaign as a direct alternative to the EU. This was despite the fact that the vast majority of Commonwealth members, and indeed the secretary general, Patricia Scotland, emphasised that membership of both organisations was not only wholly compatible but also mutually beneficial. The referendum result marked the point when the Commonwealth ceased to be simply a puzzle in Whitehall – an itch the civil service didn’t quite know how or where to scratch – and became a contributory factor in, arguably, Britain’s greatest foreign policy disaster since the end of the second world war.What, then, should be the basis of the UK’s future relationship with the Commonwealth? It could be argued that the referendum result has already ordained that this relationship will be an ever-closer one. But I doubt that. Brexit is unlikely to enhance British trade with Commonwealth countries. Indeed, in the short term, it might actually reduce it, as the UK struggles to replicate deals already in place under its EU membership. There may be closer trading and diplomatic relations with Australia and New Zealand, which represent the acceptable face of the organisation to those leave supporters who continue to regard the citizens of the notional white Commonwealth as “kith and kin”. But when it comes to the genuinely vast potential of the Indian market, a UK government driven by the anti-immigration agenda of leave voters is unlikely to make great strides in that direction. For example, India seems likely to want a relaxation of visa restrictions on its nationals in return for trade liberalisation. Certainly, the issue of immigration overshadowed Theresa May’s visit there in November 2016, leading to accusations that the UK wanted India’s business, but not its people. And whatever the future holds, invoking the name of the Commonwealth is unlikely to oil the wheels of any trade deal.As the Commonwealth summit in London approaches, get ready to hear about the long list of good causes – from ending war and poverty to tackling climate change, and from spreading democracy to promoting gender equality – that the organisation champions. All of this is, indeed, laudable. But given the Commonwealth’s record in recent years, one would need a great deal of faith and a remarkably short memory to believe that the organisation really can make a significant contribution in any of these areas. What is surely beyond doubt is that the Commonwealth cannot rescue the UK from the grievous, self-inflicted wound of Brexit. And any suggestion that it can will only serve to rob the organisation of whatever last vestiges of credibility it still possesses.Adapted from The Empire’s New Clothes: The Myth of the Commonwealth by Philip Murphy, published by Hurst on 19 April• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03a632d876fb78849be5f4912c8570f88e65fb16/0_0_3187_1993/master/3187.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa1484b55260c53ac1a2dd83991088cc 1010w","title":"decoding your cat real meaning behind purring padding peeing royal canin kitten","story":"Being a cat owner is a wonderfully confusing thing – you think you finally understand them, only for your puss to pee in your favourite trainers. From flattened ears to affectionate bum-flashing, a cat behaviouralist reveals what it all meansAs the first cat was domesticated more than 4,000 years ago, you’d think we’d have them figured out by now. But no. We still expect them to fit in with our modern lives with zero compatibility issues, despite the fact that cats are fundamentally solitary hunters so naturally they behave differently – it’s in their DNA. To hone your animal instincts, animal behaviourist, cat expert and author Anneleen Bru decodes cat behaviour for beginners.What they do: rub around your legsWhat it means: ‘I feel good’“Often a cat will do this if you are preparing their food,” says Bru. “It means: ‘I like this person, I feel safe, I’m happy.’”Cats use pheromones in a very clever way – think of it as leaving scented Post-It notes around their core living space. Rubbing against certain furniture is reinforcing a message that it’s their happy place.What they do: flash their bumWhat it means: ‘I like you’When a cat flashes its derriere to another cat they are being really welcoming.“It’s their way of saying to another cat: ‘Hello, I like you,’” explains Bru. “So, when they do that to us, their humans, it means the same thing.”What they do: purrWhat usually means: ‘I’m happy and chilled’What it sometimes means: ‘I’m stressed and in pain’“Mostly, purring is pure contentment, but sometimes it can be a sign of stress, anxiety, or illness. Cats don’t show pain, but they exhibit subtle changes in their behaviour instead. In these instances, purring offers relief to an anxious or stressed cat, in effect they are trying to self-soothe.”Tip: If your cat has always purred and stops, see a vet as it could indicate a health issue. Equally, if it doesn’t normally purr, but starts, see your vet. Any sudden behaviour changes could be a sign your cat needs veterinary treatment.What they do: sleep in weird placesWhat it means: ‘I’m keeping myself safe’“As a solitary hunter, cats like to sleep up high so they are safe and aware of their surroundings,” says Bru. “Sleeping up high, or in hidden places, like cardboard boxes or in cupboards or drawers, is in their DNA. It’s how they survive. Let them do it.”What they do: padWhat it means: ‘I’m chilling and really enjoying myself’“This is real self-soothing behaviour that goes back to kittenhood,” says Bru. “It’s the action that kittens do to release the milk at their mother’s teats, often this action can send them into a real trance and cats will do this until their final years. It’s the epitome of a happy cat.”What they do: close their eyes, while sitting close to youWhat it means: ‘I love you’“This is the equivalent of a cat’s kiss,” says Bru. “If you open your eyes wide and close them while looking at your cat, it’s telling them you love them back. It’s cat whispering. Try it.”What they do: flatten their whiskersWhat it means: ‘Leave me alone’Whiskers are super-sensitive radar devices for cats as they struggle to focus on anything an arm’s length from their face. Their long, coarse whiskers have highly sensitive nerve endings at the roots – they can determine if prey is close by and what space is around them.What they do: stare at other catsWhat it means: ‘I hate them’“This is the feline equivalent of giving the other the middle finger,” says Bru. “Don’t ever think that two cats staring at each other is going to lead to anything gentle. It won’t.”What they do: drop their tailWhat it means: ‘Leave me alone’“A straight up tail, or one held in a question-mark shape, is the sign of a happy cat,” says Bru. “This is the complete opposite.”What they do: flatten their earsWhat it means: ‘Leave me alone’ (sensing a pattern?)The most obvious sign you have an unhappy cat. Combine it with an arched back, bushy coat, flattened ears, erect bushy tail, deep moaning and you have a very, very grumpy cat.What they do: pee in your trainersWhat it means: ‘You need to sort out my litter tray situation’“In the wild, cats will pee and poo in different places,” explains Bru. “A cat is programmed to bury its poo to hide from predators, its pee is less of an issue so it will do that elsewhere. Also, cats prefer to use a litter tray that is high up and hidden so they feel less vulnerable. Look at your litter tray setup and change it accordingly.”What they do: spray urine on vertical areasWhat it means: ‘I’m worried about something in this place’“If not neutered, your cat, male or female, will spray as a sexual marking,” says Bru, “If neutered, this is a stress sign – look at what may have changed in the environment, such as the threat of other (unfamiliar) cats who may be able to enter or stare into the house.”What they do: yawnWhat is means: ‘I’m chilled’Usually a yawn is a relaxed signal of your cat releasing stress and relaxing. This is another chance for you to communicate with them. Yawn back and see what happens.What they do: gently bite you during petting What it means: ‘This is gooood’A gentle nibble means serious appreciation a harder one may suggest your cat is a little over-stimulated, so perhaps give them some space.What they do: bring you dead animalsWhat it means: ‘You’re a terrible hunter’Bringing home a kill is often more common in females than males, some research suggests by bringing home the kill, the cat has adopted you as part of its family and its DNA says it has to feed you and teach you how to hunt. However, it’s also just what they do, cats are hardwired to hunt – some more so than others. Bringing home a kill actually has nothing to do with you, says Bru. “Cats will stalk and kill prey, even when they don’t have the intention of eating it. They will bring it to their core area, because this is where they feel safe.”You don’t need to be a mind reader or body language expert to know what your cat needs to eat – at every stage of life, they require food tailored to them.

Get set with everything from advice on finding your feline friend and turning your pad into a puss-worthy palace to grooming and getting them ready for the outside world. They grow up so fast …Getting you and your pad kitten-ready need not be a drama, as long as you get to grips with just what they need to feel safe and secure. Understanding how young cats work is the key to making their transition from kittenhood to a much-loved family member as smooth as possible.“Do you need eyes in the back of your head? Maybe,” laughs registered feline behaviourist, Lucy Hoile. “But knowing how a kitten matures helps us understand their behaviour, which means fewer surprises (hopefully) and you can build a solid foundation for a lifetime of wonderful feline companionship.”Finding your new kittenIf you are responding to an advert for a kitten, there are a few pointers to be aware of to ensure you are buying from a reputable breeder.“Unlike dog breeding, there isn’t the same legislation in place for cats, so it’s best to ensure you can see the mother and her litter,” explains Hoile. “Expect to be asked a lot of information about your home setup – a caring breeder will want to know where their kitten is going.”Equally, most animal shelters have lots of unwanted kittens that need rehoming, so it is often a great place to start your search. Try the RSPCA, Cats Protection League, Battersea Dogs and Cats Home or Blue Cross for more information.Prepping your padInside, tape up any gaps that could intrigue your new kitten, such as that tiny space in between your washing machine and tumble dryer. “It’s incredible the tiny gaps your kitten can squeeze through, so better safe than sorry,” says Hoile. “Kittens are programmed to explore – they’re hunters by nature, so every new thing is an adventure. In these early weeks they have less fear than when they are a little older – they really are fearless.”You may also have noticed by now that cats can climb, so don’t presume your fencing will retain them. Kittens won’t be as strong, but they can still scale a decent height. Ensure you can keep your kitten in until they have had their first set of vaccinations (about eight weeks), before letting them explore the area around their new manor.Tip: Discuss neutering with your vet as soon as you bring your cat home – a female cat can get pregnant at around six months and an unneutered Tom is not an ideal family pet.Getting the right kitWhen it comes to shopping, less is generally more, but some specific kit is essential for settling in a kitten. “You do need to buy kitten-sized kit,” advises Hoile. “It may sound obvious but a high-sided litter tray will prevent a kitten from using it, the wrong-sized litter will be sore on a kitten’s paws and a food bowl that’s too deep will deter it from feeding adequately,” advises Hoile.As a starter kit you will need:“Buying a climbingscratchinghiding kit might seem excessive, but it’s not,” says Hoile. “Kittens climb, explore and want to hone their physical ability, if they don’t have something to climb they will shoot up your curtains, along your carpet, round your sofa … they’re programmed to train their bodies, so they need an outlet to do it.”Feeding“Kittens need to be fed little and often,” says Hoile. “Ask your breeder what foods your kitten has been used to and follow suit, making sure it is age and weight appropriate. If in doubt, ask your vet.”Myth buster: kittens and cats should not be given cow’s milk. “They can’t tolerate it and it’s a myth they crave it,” says Hoile. “Kittens and cats need fresh water in the wild they would drink from fresh running water, so they prefer to drink water fresh from the tap. Wet food is good for cats as it contains water – cats need water in their diet as they often have kidney and urine issues in later life without adequate quantities.”Worming and vaccinationsA responsible breeder or animal shelter will already have wormed your cat or will raise the issue of vaccinations with you.“Once you have your kitten, book a visit to your vet as soon as possible. Many vets hold kitten days now, they will check your kitten’s health and weight and advise on the worming, flea and vaccination programme. It is also a great way for your kitten to get accustomed to a vet’s visit. The more they are exposed to as kittens, the easier they will be to handle as adults.”GroomingGrooming isn’t just for a sleek coat, it also helps us get to know our cat’s physical shape and allows us to spot any health issues as soon as possible. Short-haired cats need grooming once a week to ensure the coat is kept free of dead hair and it helps you to bond with your cat. Longer-haired cats, such as persians, need to be groomed daily.“Otherwise, the damage to their coat and their skin can be devastating,” says Hoile. “Long-haired varieties very quickly get matted and this causes problems that go beyond just a matted coat – it can lead to skin infections and more.”House-trainingIf you get your kitten at between eight and 12 weeks, they will probably have been litter trained already.“Provide a kitten-friendly tray, with kitten-sized litter and ensure it is kept clean and accessible at all times,” says Hoile. “If your kitten isn’t using it, chances are it’s not big enough, not clean enough, or the litter is either a) too highly scented or b) too big for the kitten to rake easily.”Cats are very clean animals by nature. Once your kitten is old enough to go outside, move the litter tray outside during the day and, at night, leave a clean litter tray by the door.Going outsideYour kitten should be vaccinated before it ventures outside under supervision. International Cat Care recommends your kitten is four months old and also neutered before going into the great outdoors on its own. Most vets will microchip your kitten when they are neutered, before then a kitten safety collar with a name tag is a good idea just in case they escape – and it’s not the worst idea to keep a safety collar with a home address disc on, especially in these early days. When they are ready to go outside, monitor short trips into and around the gardensurrounding spaces.Tips for a (relatively) stress-free first-timer:Of course, not all cats love the outdoors, some are happier as house cats – if you’re unsure what’s best for your cat, speak with your vet.Whether they’re in, out or – most likely – all about, an energetic new cat needs food tailored to them.

She reflects on the hard-won highs that come with sharing a home – and a heart – with a felineIf cats are capricious, the humans who love them are worse. To be a cat lover is to embrace confusion, rejection, austerity, frustration and chaos. To share your home with a cat is to seek comfort, beauty, affection and joy, but accept that such delights will be tightly rationed, allocated seemingly at random, and frequently withheld altogether. Cat lovers are philosophers, poets and perverts, and I wouldn’t be anything else.Contrary as they are, cat lovers mistrust the undiscerning affection and allegiance of dogs. Naturally it’s possible to appreciate all animals, and I genuinely love dogs, but when a labrador bounds up to me like I’m some sort of human holy grail, I’m reminded of the words of Groucho Marx: “I don’t want to belong to any club that will accept me as a member.”My cat, Elvis, by contrast, makes me feel like I have something to prove. Elvis keeps me on my toes he holds me accountable for my actions. My cat makes me want to be a better human. And, like all pack animals, I respond well to being kept in check by my tiny furry overlord.It’s been six months since Elvis came into my life, as an eight-month-old black longhair rescue. Speaking to the shelter, I explained that I didn’t care about colour, age or gender, but specifically requested a “dog-cat”. Dog-cats share some of the genial qualities more regularly attributed to a dog, by being social, confident and affectionate. Throughout my childhood, my mother excelled at selecting dog-cats: non-skittish, friendly little moggies who could handle the aggressive adulation and clumsy affection of three small children. Gingie, Coke and Parsley were all dog-cats. Now I’m an adult, I made certain that the first cat I chose was a dog-cat.Elvis waits by the window when I return home from work in the evening. He thoughtfully inspects every new visitor to my flat, as if they are a second-hand Volvo he’s considering purchasing. He’s every inch the alpha, striding confidently into the room, announcing his presence with a succession of meows.Green-eyed, long-haired and graceful, at times Elvis resembles a moving sculpture, and he is quite the prettiest object in my home. He’s also a breathing, purring hot water bottle, and his weight, warmth and rhythmic breathing make my shoulders slacken and my pulse slow at the end of a frantic day. He frequently makes me laugh out loud, play-fighting with my left foot, lolling voluptuously on the sofa, or playing football with purloined biros across the wooden floorboards. Sometimes he glares at me with barely disguised contempt and disapproval, when I come home late, smelling of another animal. It’s nice to know that he cares enough to be cross.But Elvis allows me my independence. I’m permitted my frequent work trips, providing that I supply a temporary giant slave woman during my absence. When I come back, I stretch out on the sofa and he falls asleep on my chest, and then I know that the cat-sitter has not replaced me in his affections. One of the joys of owning a cat is building these little rituals together. Rituals that nobody else understands but Elvis and I.Adopting a rescue cat like Elvis makes the owner-cat journey even more of an emotional melodrama. I watched him grow from being a slightly cagey kitten to a confident, strutting alpha cat. Today he acts like he doesn’t need me, but I take comfort in the knowledge that it was my love, attention and steady supply of edibles that turned him into the independent young man that he is. I don’t know anything about his background we prefer not to dwell on the past, Elvis and I, and just look to our happy future together.If you’re embarking on your own cat-owner journey, get off to happy, healthy and – here’s hoping – affectionate start with our advice on everything from prepping your home to the early days of kitten development and training, and make sure you start by feeding them correctly.

The shriek of agony said as much and Eddie Jones knew only too well that the prognosis was not good, seconding Richard Wigglesworth within minutes of the final whistle.“I got a bit of stick for the yelp,” says Youngs. “Sometimes it is the fear of what it might be, especially when it is your knee. When something like that happens you fear the worst. But I certainly feel like I dodged a bullet. The results of the scan showed that I didn’t need an operation and that ice and corrective rehab would get me right, and I knew that I would still be able to play at the back-end of the season.”It is too simplistic to pin England’s subsequent stumbles on one single factor – the breakdown, Billy Vunipola’s absence or fatigue, for example – but of all the excuses offered up, Youngs’ injury seems as valid as any. Danny Care had nowhere near the impact he tends to when habitually replacing Youngs after an hour and Wigglesworth, truth be told, toiled on his international comeback. Leicester’s head coach, Matt O’Connor, was not exaggerating when he remarked that Youngs had been “drastically missed”.Youngs chose to keep his distance from the England squad during his lay-off, opting against fulfilling any commercial duties at Twickenham or offering any advice in the WhatsApp group, instead watching from the sofa with the knee in a brace. The road to recovery has been a smooth one – surgery was avoided – and he is ready to make his comeback against Northampton on Saturday with Leicester currently third and, as they always tend to do, timing their play-off push perfectly.“I was in a brace, sleeping in it, in it 24-7. I was on crutches, I couldn’t really do a lot so I would have been completely in the way. It was my decision to watch from home – you see a lot more on the TV. I’m not one that gets up and down and starts throwing things but I get a little bit animated. I care about that group.”If England have keenly felt Youngs’ absence, however, Leicester have not. The Tigers have won their last five in the Premiership, having ended 2017 with a run of six straight defeats. Indeed, it was not so long ago that O’Connor’s position was under threat but Youngs pinpoints the victory at Saracens in February as the seminal moment of the season. Furthermore Leicester have a habit of improving as winter turns to spring – since the Premiership adopted a four-team format for the 2005-06 season the Tigers have been ever-present. And victory over their east Midlands rival Northampton would go a long way to securing their place this season.“We just seem to start randomly at the beginning of the year, then we get our act together,” says Youngs. “I think the pride that we’ve always made the top four helps. Even when we’ve had seasons when it’s been really disruptive and we’ve had coaches come and go, we’ve still always had that resilience. We’ve been able to do that even when we were faced with adversity.”Land Rover, the official vehicle partner of Premiership Rugby, is celebrating 10 seasons of supporting grassroots rugby in the UK.

Thus Anthony McGrath has stepped up from number two, with the popular Dimi Mascarenhas joining the staff. On the field they bring in Peter Siddle for early overseas duties, before Neil Wagner returns to send them down from mid-May. Matt Coles, from Kent, is their other significant addition. A blend of experience and youth suggests another challenge, especially if Simon Harmer and Jamie Porter pick up where they left off.T20 Blast eight in South GroupStarting like a train last summer before grinding to a halt, Hampshire have since bolstered their batting by drafting in Hashim Amla as their early overseas player and winning the race to sign Sam Northeast from Kent. The latter appears primed for the step up to Division One and is freed from captaincy duties, so if runs flow then England chatter may well follow. Dale Steyn is due for a two-match stint in June and a possible return later in the season but much depends on his fitness. Reece Topley will be white-ball only and Mason Crane is out for two months.Royal London Cup sixth in South GroupDurham were raided over the winter, with Keaton Jennings and Graham Onions bolstering a side that surpassed expectations last summer and appear to be shaping up for a title challenge. Onions replaces Kyle Jarvis, who has given up Kolpak status to return to Zimbabwe, but Shiv Chanderpaul returns in this capacity, aged 43, after averaging 51 last season. Liam Livingstone steps up as captain although he will be pushing for a Test place, while the experienced Australian seamer Joe Mennie arrives as overseas player. Haseeb Hameed, Alex Davies and Saqib Mahmood are due strong seasons.T20 Blast: seventh in North GroupNotts’ return to the top-flight comes after a golden summer that saw both white-ball trophies lifted. The previous two times promotion has been achieved the title has followed but consolidation would be fine given the retirements of Chris Read and Michael Lumb, and Alex Hales going limited-overs only. In come the veteran Chris Nash from Sussex and Ross Taylor as the early overseas player. Tom Moores gets his chance with the gloves while Steven Mullaney steps up as captain. A long-term injury to Paul Coughlin, after the all-rounder signed from Durham, is a blow but Jake Ball returns from the Ashes with a point to prove.Last summer’s great escape followed a title challenge the previous year, so which way Somerset go this time around is tricky to gauge, especially as they are under new management. The pitch at Taunton – aka Ciderabad – will likely continue to be a strong asset although how much they see of Jack Leach will now hinge on England’s requirements. Jamie Overton’s return from injury and his twin Craig’s confidence from international honours are plusses, although Cameron Bancroft has seen his overseas deal scrapped for his role in the Australian ball-tampering scandal. Tom Abell just about survived his first year as captain and should be better for it.Rory Burns replaces Gareth Batty as captain and could push for England honours if the opener adds more centuries to his already consistent returns. Kumar Sangakkara’s departure leaves a 1,491-run hole to fill – Virat Kohli may possibly fill this for three matches – while their overseas deal for Mitchell Marsh has been scuppered by ankle surgery. Tom Curran has gone to the IPL but a reinforcement comes in the shape of Morne Morkel, signed on a two-year Kolpak deal. Vikram Solanki, Ryan Sidebottom and Chris Taylor have all joined the coaching staff.The Pears are newly promoted but under new management, with the Steve Rhodes era now ended. In come Kevin Sharp and the former New Road favourite Alan Richardson to run the show. Steve Magoffin has arrived from Sussex to take the new ball (citing the latter as inspiration), while a fellow Australian, Travis Head, is their overseas player. Otherwise it is over to homegrown talent again, with Daryl Mitchell looking to replicate last year’s four-figure summer and Joe Clarke getting a chance to nudge the England selectors in Division One. Two away games to begin with are handy given the latest flooding to hit New Road.County Championship: first Division TwoGeoffrey Boycott has already pooh-poohed the appointment of a sports psychologist to address falling returns from the batsmen in first-class cricket last year. But the diagnosis is at least accurate, with Gary Ballance’s average of 67 some 30 runs higher than the next best. Two old favourites return to share overseas duties, with Cheteshwar Pujara – Steve to his team-mates – signed up until June and Kane Williamson thereafter. To the annoyance of those in charge, David Willey and Liam Plunkett have been lost to the IPL at the 11th hour, while Adil Rashid has signed a white-ball only deal.Last season’s extra focus on Twenty20 cricket, hiring John Wright as specialist coach, returned a second-place group stage finish only for Derbyshire be marmalised by Hampshire in the quarter-finals. Ravi Rampaul, on a Kolpak deal from Surrey, represents one of two additions to last season, with South African seamer Duane Olivier filling the overseas slot for the first half of the season. All-rounder Shiv Thakor has left following his conviction for two charges of indecent exposure. Runs from the top order and an injury-free season for Hardus Viljoen are needed.Freed from the shackles of their draconian points deductions but having lost another three key first-team players, Durham will once again look to their production line of local talent under the stewardship of the evergreen Paul Collingwood. Aiden Markram, the palindromic South African opener, looks a shrewd signing until mid-May after a bumper start to his Test career, after which New Zealander Tom Latham arrives and will lead the 50-over side. The Indian spin-bowling all-rounder Axar Patel finishes off the season.The arrival of Shaun Marsh as overseas player for the season, fresh from reasserting himself as a Test cricketer, looks a coup for Glamorgan, who saw some incremental improvement across last summer. Their semi-final Blast finish was the highlight and now under the stewardship of Colin Ingram, the Kolpak white-ball cricketer, they should be strong in the limited-overs formats. Championship-wise, it is a question of whether the likes of Aneurin Donald and Andrew Salter turn talent into consistent returns.The opener Chris Dent has taken over the captaincy of a side that regressed slightly last summer. Runs were the main issue but the club has switched to signing a bowler as their overseas player, with the livewire South Australia seamer Daniel Worral joining until mid-July. The batsmen will, however, get some extra support from Chris Rogers in a two-month coaching role. The all-rounder Ryan Higgins has joined from Middlesex and the bowling will be lead by last year’s player of the season, the seamer Liam Norwell. Andrew Tye and Michael Klinger are strong overseas players for the Blast, where their best chance of success appears.The departures of Sam Northeast to Hampshire and Matt Coles to Essex were significant blows over the winter. The likeable Sam Billings takes over the captaincy from the former (once he returns from the IPL) while the South African Heino Kuhn arrives on a Kolpak deal to shore up the batting. Seamer Harry Podmore has also come in from Middlesex, with Matt Henry, a Kiwi quick, their overseas player for the first half of the season. The former ECB managing director Paul Downton is now running the club too.The Foxes have undergone their latest reboot, with club favourite Paul Nixon expected to inject fresh energy as head coach – and some T20 nous from his two Caribbean Premier League titles – and Michael Carberry arriving from Hampshire to lead the side in all formats. The Indian seamer Varun Aaron and the highly-rated Zak Chappell could combine for the quickest pairing in the ision but will need support, as will the batting mainstay Mark Cosgrove, who returns to the ranks after a disappointing spell in charge results-wise.All the talk last summer was of hitting the reset button after lifting the title in 2016 but instead Middlesex flopped on all fronts. Dawid Malan’s rise to the captaincy is likely to be stop-start given his England commitments, while Eoin Morgan was due to be available for 12 championship matches but misses at least three with a broken thumb. Nick Compton, previously told he would not feature as the club look to the future, may yet receive a lifeline. The Australian all-rounder Hilton Cartwright arrives as early season cover.White-ball specialism made way for a stronger first-class campaign last summer and the club has made some interesting signings over the winter. The seamer Brett Hutton gets his chance after sitting in reserve for long spells at Notts, while the South African wicketkeeper Ricardo Vasconcelos (holder of an EU passport) is highly rated in his home country. Rory Kleinveldt returns as overseas player from mid-May, with the New Zealand seamer Doug Bracewell covering until then. Ben Duckett misses the early championship rounds after finger surgery.Few can argue that Sussex have pulled off a coup in luring Jason Gillespie back to county cricket. The architect of Yorkshire’s two most recent titles arrives after winning the Big Bash League with Adelaide Strikers. Big things are expected from Ben Brown, the new captain, and Michael Burgess, while Luke Wells will look to build on last year’s 1,292-run season. Rashid Khan could be the signing of the summer when the Afghan leg-spinner arrives for the Blast and India’s Ishant Sharma is in place for the first two months.The silver-lining of reaching the Blast final thanks to a switch of captaincy from Ian Bell to Grant Elliott and an injection of youth, could not detract from the black cloud of relegation. An ageing squad of high wages but diminishing returns was to blame – the bowling and fitness coaches inexplicably carried the can – but the rebuild at least began early, with the mid-season signings of Dom Sibley, Adam Hose and Will Rhodes. Jeetan Patel takes over as captain and the hope is that Bell can find form in Division Two. Promotion is demanded."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/599d1758aa11eebef996eb2e863d58cfc05fffbb/45_56_2478_1487/master/2478.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c9e510971fa1e34dfb47a67fbddc7ba8 1240w","title":"wisden three women world cup winners 2017","story":"• England’s Knight, Shrubsole and Sciver take the honours• Essex’s Jamie Porter and Shai Hope of West Indies make up quintetA hat-trick of World Cup winners sees women make up the majority of Wisden’s cricketers of the year for the first time in the award’s history, with Heather Knight, Anya Shrubsole and Nat Sciver all named in the famous five for 2018.Only twice before have female cricketers been among the list of leading players from the previous English summer – Claire Taylor broke new ground in 2009, Charlotte Edwards followed five years later – but that heady day last July, when Knight lifted the trophy at a packed Lord’s, has seen the floodgates open.Making up the quintet are Jamie Porter, whose 75 wickets propelled Essex to their first County Championship title since 1992, and Shai Hope, scorer of twin hundreds as an unheralded West Indies side pulled off a shock five-wicket victory over England in the second Test at Headingley.Indeed, it is the first time since 2002 that no current England men’s international has made the list. The 130-year-old award can only be won once in a career, of course, although it is perhaps Tammy Beaumont, leading scorer and player of the women’s World Cup, whose case was strongest among those to miss out.Describing Knight’s achievement as “the culmination of a personal tour de force that helped change women’s cricket for ever”, Wisden’s editor, Lawrence Booth, noted the 27-year-old’s captaincy throughout a campaign in which she scored 364 runs at an average of 45, including a century against Pakistan.It is Shrubsole who is on the cover of the 155th edition, however, after the seamer lit up a Lord’s final that had been slipping away from the home side with a spell of five for 11, in figures of six for 46, that derailed India’s chase of 229 and, according to Booth, secured “national hero status”.Sciver, meanwhile, is credited for producing the most memorable shot of 2017 – the deliberate clip between her legs that was dubbed “The Natmeg” in some quarters – but is described as “more than a one-trick pony”, given her 346 runs in the tournament and figures of three for three with the ball against West Indies.New to Wisden this year is the introduction of an award for the leading Twenty20 cricketer in the world. It is another sign of the times, too, both in terms of the format’s recognition, some 15 years on from its inception, and the nationality of the winner: Afghanistan’s leg-spinning sensation, Rashid Khan.The 19-year-old has emerged as one of the most in-demand Twenty20 cricketers on the circuit – Wisden describes his googly as “one of the most dangerous deliveries in the world game” – with 80 wickets in 2017 at just 14 apiece. An economy-rate of 5.53 was equally impressive.This short-format award complements the existing men and women’s leading cricketer in the world categories, which this year are India’s two captains: Virat Kohli and Mithali Raj. Their sides lost their respective global finals – the Champions Trophy and the Women’s World Cup – but they enjoyed stellar returns personally.For Kohli it is the second year in succession he has topped the lot, with his 2,818 runs across all formats more than 700 ahead of Joe Root in second place. Raj, meanwhile, surpassed Edwards as the all-time leading run scorer in women’s ODIs and scored a record seven successive half-centuries.Elsewhere in Wisden, which is published on Thursday, Booth uses his notes to warn the England and Wales Cricket Board not to take the Ashes for granted after the winter’s 4-0 defeat in Australia amid a record run of 13 away Tests without a victory for the national team.The ECB’s chief executive, Tom Harrison, also sets out his vision for the new Twenty20 tournament from 2020 onwards – with the counter argument presented by ESPNCricinfo’s George Dobell – while Tanya Aldred has written on both sexism in cricket and the sport’s relationship with the environment.Among the index of unusual occurrences in this year’s edition is the tantalising “Groundstaff forced home in underpants”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ee4e78120b90f00c445606983041832832b6918/203_243_3005_1803/master/3005.jpg?w=3000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=785b4979e52a5b3573a669487f6b660f 6000w","title":"commonwealth games day six in pictures","story":"All the latest pictures from the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast as cyclists, boxers, ers and athletes battle for medals"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c43493fa1a6b00b3e06e45cc623f619d2fa89b2/0_0_3276_2184/master/3276.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d85e3056cf0e7210e750adec7a02762 1010w","title":"commonwealth games 2018 day seven netball beach volleyball hockey and more live","story":"They are having some evening, Starc, the brother of the Aussie cricketer Mitchell, brings home another medal.Isis Holt, the 16-year-old, takes victory with an electric run of 13.58secs. She celebrates with a little jiving rendition with her fellow Aussies. Maria Lyle, of Scotland, takes silver, Brianna Coop takes bronze. All of the competitors in this discipline have cerebral palsy.Are Australia heading for their 49th gold of the Games? Brandon Starc has made a rip-roaring start to the men’s long jump, with a mammoth 2.32m.Leon Reid is into tomorrow’s men’s 200m final, where he will join the silky, speeding Zharnel Hughes. “My mum has come all this way – she couldn’t come here for nothing – so I had to get it done,” he says. “She’s going to be buzzing, I can’t wait to go and see here.” Hughes adds: “I know what I can do, and I’m focused, ready to go.”England’s Jack Laugher, who clinched gold a little earlier, has been speaking. “I’ve been struggling with injuries all year, it’s been a really terrible time,” he told the BBC. “I’ve only had a couple of w weeks training, and defending a title is so tough, so I’m really proud.”The island country take gold in the team final. Malaysia take silver, Australia bronze. After four rotations, it’s Cyprus who come out on top.The men’s 200m semi-finals are in full swing, with Richard Kilty the first to miss out. The top two from each heat, plus the two fastest losers, will go through to the final. Zharnel Hughes goes in the second semi, Northern Ireland’s Leon Reid in the third. Usain Bolt, present on the Gold Coast for these Games, of course, set the world record in Berlin in 2009, 19.19secs.Not a great Commonwealth Games debut for Robbie Grabarz, who is out of the men’s high jump after fluffing three straight attempts. The 30-year-old, a bronze medalist at London 2012, will be gutted with that. Scotland’s Allan Smith has half a chance of nabbing a medal, though.Kathryn Mitchell is up on the podium to collect her javelin gold in front a home crowd. She looks totally made up, taking deep breaths and close to tears through the Australian national anthem, cradling the Games’ mascot Borobi, the koala, all the way through. What’s next? The men’s long jump and shot put will be upon us in a minute, while the women’s 400m will wrap up the athletics on day seven. Elsewhere, the women’s synchronised 10m platform final kicks off in an hour, with England’s hopes resting on Birch and Toulson. Australia, meanwhile, have two double-acts involved in the latter.Jack Laugher defends his crown, with a stonking score of 438.00 at the Optus Aquatics Centre. James Connor takes silver for Australia, while James Heatly picks up bronze, and another medal for Scotland. Laugher will be back on Thursday, in the 3m, in search of more silverware. Double success for England: Dina Asher-Smith is into tomorrow’s 200m final, breezing through the semis. “I’m really excited, I’m looking to go quicker and I really want to do well here and do England proud.” In the long jump, Jazmin Sawyers joins Shara Proctor in the final. Kathryn Mitchell storms to victory, and even a foul on her final throw doesn’t dampen the enthusiasm around a rocking Carrara Stadium, in front of a deafening home crowd. A brilliant atmosphere. A brilliant gold medal for Aisha Praught, getting over the line in 9.21.00. That’s some result, with Chespol of Kenya forced to take silver and bronze, with Rosie Clarke, of England, taking fourth. “It was a great race to be a part of,” Clarke says. “We are trying to whittle our way towards Kenya, but hopefully in the next couple of years we can push on.”In the ing, Jack Laugher is cruising, in the lead with a score of 217.50. Ross Haslam, one of two Haslam brothers in the 1m springboard, is in the running to take silver while Heatly’s down in sixth. All to play for yet too. To the women’s 3000m steeplechase, with Iona Lake and Rosie Clarke running for England. There are two Australians in the field too, but Kenya have three representations, and they’ll fancy their chances. Jack Laugher is setting the tone here, making easy work, but Australia’s Kurtis Matthews and James Connor recording impressive scores with four es still to come. Over in the track and field, Shara Proctor, a silver medalist in 2015, is into the long jump final. We’re under way at the Aquatics Centre, with the Australian 17-year-old Matthew Carter setting the early pace with a brilliant score of 67.60. Ross Haslam ed well this morning, and his first e produces a solid score of just over 62. In the boxing ring, Oriyomi threw in the towel, handing McNaul a route through from the quarter-finals.Before we jump into the pool for the 1m springboard final, more boxing, with Aylsat Oriyomi, of Nigeria taking on Northern Ireland’s Carly McNaul. After years operating in Nicola Adams’ shadow, Lisa Whiteside finally steps out into the limelight and beats Pinki Rani of India via split decision (2-3) to guarantee a medal. She goes into the bronze-medal match. To the boxing now then, where Lisa Whiteside, of England, is taking on Pinki Rani, of India, in the 51kg quarter-finals. Whiteside has started well, with a series of direct hits, a couple of right-hand jabs. We have about a minute to go in the second, with a terrific reverse one-two by Rani taking Whiteside by surprise but the 32-year-old from Chorley looks in control.Lawn bowls kickstarts a flurry of medal events, with 10 golds to play for before day seven is out on the Gold Coast. That gets under way in half an hour or so, and after that, we will rattle through the athletics, including the javelin, shot put, high and long jump. Australia’s men have beaten New Zealand 2-1 in a very nervy hockey meeting between the two in Pool A. India duel with England shortly, while Canada take on South Africa, from the same group. Story of the day contender: Five Cameroonian athletes have been reported missing from the athletes village, with suspicion they have fled with the intention not to return home.In the badminton, Ciaran Chambers, of Northern Ireland, has been defeated by Sri Lanka in the round of 32, but earlier, Rajiv Ouseph got the better of Uganda’s Ekiring. In the women’s singles, it’s England v Jersey, with Chloe Birch taking on Elise Dixon. We are an hour away from Jack Laugher, the Olympic champion, defending his title. He’s in the 1m springboard final, after breezing through the preliminaries this morning. Laugher is one of five from the home nations in a 12-strong final. After that, Lois Toulson and Robyn Birch will be in action in the 10m women’s platform.The rhythmic gymnastics team finals are under way, with the first rotation in full swing. England and Wales are both in contention. All we can think of really, though, is this, right?In the netball, Uganda are getting the better of Scotland, to the tune of a 51-35 scoreline. A little earlier, also in Pool B, England toppled New Zealand 54-45, while in Pool A, Northern Ireland prospered against Fiji. Back at the Hockey Centre, Australia continue to edge out New Zealand.Good morning, good evening. What’s coming up in terms of medals? Before the athletics kicks in, in around an hour or so, in the pool, there’s the men’s 1m springboard final and, a little later, the women’s synchronised 10m platform medal event. Once we return to the track and field, we have the men’s high jump final, long jump and, lastly, the women’s 400m. Elsewhere, there will be plenty of fun and games in the shape of badminton, beach volleyball, hockey and table tennis. Men’s hockey: New Zealand miss a great chance to go ahead, Hugh Inglis missing an open-goal backhand shot from close range after Aussie keeper Tyler Lovell’s save of a penalty corner popped out to Inglis.And wouldn’t you know it, Australia go down the other end and open the scoring! And what a goal it was. Jacob Whetton picked up the ball on the right byline, dribbled into the circle and from an impossibly acute angle lifted the ball past the keeper and into the top side netting of the far post. That was eye of the needle stuff. So it’s 1-0 Australia with seven minutes remaining in the second quarter.And with that goal I shall pull stumps for the evening. Fear not, I leave you in the very capable hands of Ben Fisher. Enjoy your evening.Australia and New Zealand are 0-0 at the end of the first quarter of their Pool A men’s hockey clash. The Kookaburras came this close to opening the scoring from a penalty corner in the final minute of the opening quarter but Shea McAleese produced a brilliant block to deflect Jeremy Hayward’s vicious drive over the goal. Australia and New Zealand go into the game locked on 9 points. The winner of this will, in theory at least, get an easier draw during the knock-out stage.Australia have defeated England in the beach volleyball semifinal at Coolangatta Beach! The top seeds of Damien Schumann and Chris McHugh were too strong for the England pairing of Jake Sheaf and Chris Gregory, winning it in two sets: 21-13, 21-16. In netball Pool B action, Scotland trails Uganda 21-17 early in the second quarter. Earlier today, England defeated New Zealand 54-45 to leave the Silver Ferns in disarray. Also, South Africa steamrolled Barbados 85-25 and Northern Ireland defeated Fiji 73-46.For New Zealand - who suffered their worst loss defeat to England in their history - progress to the semis is now out of their hands. At Coolangatta Beach, in the men’s volleyball semifinal, Australia has taken the first set 21-13. They lead England 4-1 in the second after Schumann drops a canny cut shot past the England blocker.Scotland’s David McMath has outlasted and out-shot his competitors to win, with a Games record score of 74, the men’s double trap.The Isle of Man’s Tim Kneale finished with the silver medal ahead of India’s Ankur Mittal who took bronze.Back at the shooting, Scotland’s McMath has got his nose in front leading both Kneale and Mittal by two. All three are now guaranteed a medal Ashab Mohd having been the third man eliminated from the final six.Meanwhile, Australia and England have hit the Coolangatta Beach sand for the men’s beach volleyball semifinal. In the first set, Australia’s pairing of McHugh and Schumann lead England’s Gregory and Sheaf 6-4. Still at the men’s double trap final and it’s Pakistan’s Iqbal eliminated. Of the four shooters remaining Mittal maintains his lead with 3740. Scotland’s McMath and the Isle of Man’s Kneale still in the hunt, just two behind.Unfortunately for the home crowd, and himself, Willett is the first man eliminated from the final six. India’s Mittal leads with 28 from 30 shots, with McMath and Kneale on 26.India have put in a lot of resources into strengthening their shooting team and it’s paying off at these Games.We’re back at the Belmont Shooting Centre for the men’s double trap final. Australia’s James Willett is in the hunt alongside India’s Ankur Mittal and Ashab Mohd, Scotland’s David McMath, and the Isle of Man’s Tim Kneale. Also in action is Pakistan’s Aamer Iqbal.The way this final works is that after each round one shooter drops off and the remaining shooters go at it again. So, it’s pretty much like The Hunger Games. Or perhaps like Stephen King’s The Long Walk, a story about an endurance race in which competitors get shot dead when they drop below an assigned pace. The winner is the last man standing.In the men’s hockey Pakistan and Malaysia are 1-1 in their Pool B match as the fourth quarter gets underway. Australia and New Zealand will be banging heads in about 45 minutes.More updates from earlier action:Northern Ireland’s Kristina O’Hara won her semifinal in the women’s boxing 45-48kg ision meaning she will take on India’s MC Mery Kom for the gold on Saturday.In the shoot-off Singh hits both targets, while Cox hits only one. Gold to Singh! Cox will be shattered having taken a healthy lead into the final round. Even after a shaky start she needed to hit ‘just’ 7 of the last 12 targets to secure the gold but she hit only six, which meant a shoot-off was necessary.Singh’s consistency has seen her win India’s 12th gold medal of these Games.But Cox falters down the stretch, scoring 18 to Singh’s 25, which means she finishes level with Singh on 96! The pair will have a shoot-off for gold.Scotland’s Linda Pearson, meantime, has secured the bronze medal! The women’s double trap final is underway at the Belmont Shooting Centre. We’re in the fourth and final round and Australia’s Emma Cox, who was leading into the final round, is currently looking to overhaul India’s Shreyasi Singh who has completed her fourth round. Singh has 96 points in the bank after a final round 25.If you’re unfamiliar with the double trap, it’s that event where competitors, armed with a shotgun, aim to hit clay targets lobbed into the air. As the name suggests, in the double trap two clay targets are launched at a time which requires the shooter to nail the first target, scan the sky and hit the second before it drops to the ground. Cox is a school teacher in Victoria and clearly has a good eye. Are teachers still allowed to throw blackboard dusters are students like they did back in the day? You wouldn’t test Cox’s aim if they were.As I write, Cox draws to within 3 points of Singh and appears to have this one in the bag!Underway right now at the Coomera Indoor Sports Centre are qualifiers in rhythmic gymnastics. It really is remarkable what these young women and girls are able to do. Strength, speed, grace and the kind of hand eye coordination that would see them put in the first slip position were they to put their hand to cricket. Some of the catches are remarkable.In case you’ve missed it, five Cameroonian athletes have been reported as missing. Here’s our report:At 4.30pm today Australia’s Kookaburras (that’s the men’s hockey team, for those not familiar with the home nation’s penchant for naming their national sporting teams after native animals) will play New Zealand is the preliminary rounds. Before that, Malaysia will take on Pakistan. That match is due to get underway soon and I’ll endeavour to keep you posted.A reminder that women’s 3m synchro final was held earlier with Australia’s Esther Qin and Georgia Sheehan coming from the clouds to win the gold. They came good when it counted most, executing their final e with aplomb and nary asplash when their rivals faltered. One of those rivals was fellow Aussies Maddison Keeney and Anabelle Smith who recorded a failed e in their final round while in the gold medal position.As I mentioned, it’s been a good morning for Australia’s Daniel Repacholi who won gold in the 50m pistol event. In what was his last Commonwealth Games before retirement, the 35-year-old bear-of-a-man with a bushranger beard thick enough to house a family of marsupials backed up wins in Melbourne 2006 and Glasgow 2014 to take his third Commonwealth Games crown.He won with a 6.7-point margin from Bangladesh’s Shakil Ahmed and India’s Om Mitharval.“It’s f---ing awesome,” said Repacholi, who finished fourth in his only other event on Monday, the 10m air pistol.“I came here for two, but I got one. I can walk away with that and hold my head high.“The other day it didn’t work for me, it just wasn’t my time, but this time it worked fine.”Here we go again. It may be the seventh day but there is no rest in sight for the athletes of these Games, with another 15 gold medals up for grabs in the glorious Gold Coast sunshine.Two of those have already been secured: Daniel Repacholi, the Australian with the monster frame and a beard to match, won the 50m pistol final in a Games record at Belmont Shooting Centre in Brisbane and Esther Qin and Georgia Sheehan, also of Australia, claimed the women’s synchronised 3m springboard in the ing pool.The Australian pair won with a score of 284.10, ahead of England’s Alicia Blagg and Katherine Torrance in second. But it was agony for another Australian duo, Maddison Keeney and Anabelle Smith, who were left disappointed after recording a failed e while in the gold medal position.There has been a degree of drama on the netball court too, with New Zealand’s Silver Ferns going down to England 54-45 to cast doubt on their hopes of reaching a medal match. Various events in the badminton, boxing, ing, hockey, gymnastics, squash, table tennis and lawn bowling are also underway – we’ll keep you updated throughout the Queensland day.Coming up later we’ll be able to feast on athletics, beach volleyball and more netball. To think this is one of the “quieter” days of competition.As for those medals, here’s what is left to be won today:"},{"url":null,"title":"zuckerberg facebook testimony latest news regulation congress","story":"Facebook’s CEO appeared before Congress in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal to address concerns over users’ dataMark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, warned on Tuesday of an online propaganda “arms race” with Russia and vowed that fighting interference in elections around the world is now his top priority.The 33-year-old billionaire, during testimony that lasted nearly five hours, was speaking to Congress in what was widely seen as a moment of reckoning for America’s tech industry. It came in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which, Facebook has admitted, the personal information of up to 87 million users were harvested without their permission.Zuckerberg’s comments gave an insight into the unnerving reach and influence of Facebook in numerous democratic societies. “The most important thing I care about right now is making sure no one interferes in the various 2018 elections around the world,” he said under questioning by Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico.The senator made reference to a billboard displayed earlier in the hearing that showed images – including Trump, the Green Party candidate Jill Stein, and the Confederate flag – allegedly spread online by Russian operatives during the 2016 presidential election. He asked if Zuckerberg could guarantee such images would not appear on Facebook again.“Senator, no, I can’t guarantee that because this is an ongoing arms race,” the CEO said. “As long as there are people sitting in Russia whose job it is to try and interfere with elections around the world, this is going to be an ongoing conflict.”Earlier in the hearing, Zuckerberg acknowledged that “one of my greatest regrets in running the company” was being slow to uncover and act against disinformation campaigns by Russian trolls during the election.The blockbuster joint hearing of the US Senate’s commerce and judiciary committees on Capitol Hill was a humbling moment for the young entrepreneur. Wearing a suit, white shirt and sky blue tie instead of his customary T-shirt, he sat contrite and silent as senator after senator expressed deep concerns about the company’s gathering of personal information.Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat, told him: “Let me just cut to the chase. If you and other social media companies do not get your act in order, none of us are going to have any privacy any more. If Facebook and other online companies will not or cannot fix the privacy invasions, then we are going to have to. We, the Congress.”Senator John Thune, a Republican and the chairman of the Senate commerce committee, noted that Facebook’s business model offers a free service in exchange for personal data. “For this model to persist, both sides of the bargain need to know what’s involved,” he said. “I’m not convinced Facebook’s users have the information they need to make decisions.”Thune added: “Mr Zuckerberg, in many ways you and the company that you’ve created, the story you’ve created, represent the American dream ... At the same time, you have an obligation, and it’s up to you, to ensure that dream doesn’t become a privacy nightmare for the scores of people who use Facebook.”Zuckerberg and Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, have been on a media apology tour since the Cambridge Analytica story broke in the Observer, the Guardian’s sister Sunday newspaper in the UK, and he continued to apologize several times during Tuesday’s hearing.Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook should not have trusted Cambridge Analytica’s assurance that it would stop using the personal information it harvested. “In retrospect, that was a mistake. We shouldn’t have taken their word for it. We considered that a closed case.” He admitted that Facebook did not alert the Federal Trade Commission about the data collection. Under questioning, he promised that Facebook was conducting a “full investigation” into every app that has access to users’ information, numbering tens of thousands. “If we find they’re doing anything improper, we’ll ban them from Facebook,” he said.He also initially claimed that Cambridge Analytica had not been an advertiser in 2015 but, after a brief adjournment in which he consulted with staff, he corrected himself: it had indeed been an advertiser later that year and therefore could have been banned. When Zuckerberg, who was making his first appearance before Congress, first took his seat, surrounded by a thick forest of clicking cameras, he looked somewhat like a prisoner in the dock. But he seemed to grow in confidence as the afternoon wore on and tried to appear open and cooperative. He frequently used the respectful term “Senator” and complimented them for asking “important questions”, some of which he said “his team” would report back on later.Some senators tried to throw him off balance. John Kennedy of Louisiana said bluntly: “Your user agreement sucks.” Democrat Dick Durbin asked: “Would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?” There was a long pause before Zuckerberg replied: “No.” There was laughter in the room.Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal then almost gave him cause to regret it. He challenged Facebook’s contention that Aleksandr Kogan, a Moldovan-born researcher from Cambridge University, deceived the company when he harvested user data. Blumenthal had what he claimed was a previously undisclosed 2014 terms of service document that explicitly permitted Kogan to “sell, licence (by whatever means and on whatever terms) and archive your contribution and data”.Blumenthal said: “We’ve seen the apology tours before. You have refused to acknowledge even an ethical violation to report this violation of the FTC consent decree. My reservation about your testimony today is that I don’t see how you can change your business model unless there are specific rules of the road. Your business model is to maximise profit over privacy.”Several topics dominated the hearing, including the 2016 presidential election. Zuckerberg confirmed that Facebook officials have been interviewed by officials from the special counsel Robert Mueller, who has been investigating Russia’s role in meddling in the 2016 election. “I know we are working with them,” said Zuckerberg, acknowledging that “there may be” a subpoena but he was uncertain.Regulation was also brought up repeatedly, including by the Republican senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, who asked Zuckerberg whether Facebook was a monopoly. “It certainly doesn’t feel like that to me,” he replied, prompting mirth in the public gallery. Graham pressed him on the issue of regulation. Zuckerberg said: “My position is not that there should be no regulation.”Asked if Facebook would therefore embrace regulation, the CEO said: “If it’s the right regulation, then yes.” Graham: “Would you work with us?” Zuckerberg: “Absolutely.”Senator John Cornyn pushed him on whether Facebook is a neutral platform. Zuckerberg replied, “I agree that we are responsible for the content” – a significant concession that could open the way for Facebook to be held to the same legal standards as a traditional media company.Zuckerberg will face a second grilling on Wednesday from the US House energy and commerce committee."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37de9b683e104cf2334f25e9368a01c378638096/0_0_4175_2505/master/4175.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4c61167b8eed7b6e5255c6aa082da61e 1240w","title":"huawei matebook x pro laptop review slim macbook pro rival","story":"Beautiful screen, excellent keyboard, great trackpad – Huawei’s new machine shows it has what it takes to build a great laptopThe MateBook X Pro is Huawei’s more powerful follow up to last year’s excellent MateBook X, and as the name might imply it is aimed squarely at Apple’s MacBook Pro.PC laptops have come a long way in the last few years, with good design, build and performance – all hallmarks of Apple’s laptop line – now common in the £1,000-plus category.It would be fair to say that the MateBook X Pro has more than a passing resemblance to Apple’s top-end laptop. It’s not that it’s a carbon copy, more a machine that takes just the good bits.With the lid closed it looks like a fairly generic thin-and-light aluminium laptop with a gentle taper and a Huawei logo on the top, available in “space grey” and silver. Open it and you find a MacBook-like backlit keyboard, large trackpad, a power button and two side grilles.But the screen is the star of the show. It’s a beautiful and crisp 13.9in 3:2-ratio screen squeezed into the frame with very slim bezels all round. It’s easily one of the best on the market and is quite large by modern laptop standards, housed in a smaller body typically associated with a 12in-screen laptop.The build of the machine is generally very good, with chamfered edges and a good fit and finish. There’s no give or flex in the keyboard, but there is a little in the rest of the deck and at the sides. The screen also has a little bit of give when squeezed when closed, or twisted when open.The MateBook X Pro is available in a couple of configurations, with a choice of 8th generation Core i5 and i7 processors, 8 or 16GB of RAM and 256 or 512GB of storage.Most of that is par for the course, but the Huawei machine also comes with a discrete Nvidia GeForce MX150 graphics card with 2GB of dedicated memory, which is rare for a machine of this size.The MX150 won’t set the gaming world alight, but it is a significant step up in performance for things like editing photos and video, or even powering a 4K display over your typical integrated graphics chips. It’s worth noting that the MX150 comes in two versions and the MateBook X Pro is fitted with the lower power 10W version, which is less powerful but more frugal than the 25W version that some other machines have fitted.Overall the MateBook X Pro was one of the best performing laptops I’ve ever used, easily handling anything and everything from video editing and advanced photo editing, to a bit of light gaming and Chrome with as many tabs as you can fit on one screen.The MateBook X Pro might be thin, but it still has a single full-sized USB 3.0 port along side a USB-C port and a Thunderbolt 3 port. Either of the USB-C-shaped ports can be used to charge the machine, while there’s a traditional headphones socket, but no card reader.Huawei is well known for its battery life in smartphones. Unfortunately, while the MateBook X Pro has reasonable battery life it isn’t anywhere near class-leading. It will get you through a work day without needing the charger, but if you want to watch a video on the commute home you’ll be out of luck.In my testing the MateBook X Pro lasted just over eight hours between charges while performing regular office duties, which includes lots of email, around 15 browser tabs open in Chrome, some photo editing, listening to music via Bluetooth headphones and lots of writing into lightweight text editors. Heavier things such as gaming affected the battery life quite a bit, but generally speaking most users will plug the laptop in to game or perform similarly demanding tasks for any extended period.Performance aside, the MateBook X Pro is a lovely machine to use. It’s whisper-quiet for the most part, with its fans only spinning under sustained heavy load, and its brilliant screen is matched by an equally excellent keyboard and trackpad. The keyboard looks like a MacBook Pro keyboard, but with real key travel. It’s a satisfying typing experience that is rarer than you might think on even expensive laptops.The keyboard also hides one of the most interesting tricks I’ve seen on a laptop in a while. The key between F6 and F7 is actually a pop-up webcam. Press it and it reveals a one-megapixel camera, which certainly has a tendency for the up-the-nose shot, but simply doesn’t get in the way during normal use. If you’re one of the vast majority of laptop users that barely ever turn on their webcam, this is a great compromise and it means no one is going to be able to hack your webcam and spy on you. There’s even a mute switch for the microphones, so no one will be able to listen to you either.The large trackpad is silky smooth and responsive, making it one of the best in the industry – at no stage did I end up zooming when I tried to scroll, which is something many PC laptops still struggle with.The power button doubles as a fingerprint scanner and will recognise you and log you into Windows when switching on with one momentary press, taking about eight seconds to power on and be useable. The MateBook X Pro has a Dolby Atmos sound system with four speakers built into it: two tweeters at the back and two bass speakers at the front, not that there’s any visual indication that they’re there.I was sceptical, but the four-speaker system actually works very well. It’s louder, clearer and has a smidgeon more bass than most of the best of the rest, although the audio is less direct than it might be on a machine with front-facing speakers such as Microsoft’s Surface Pro.They’re still laptop speakers, so don’t expect true room-filling sound or the quality of a set of external speakers, but they’re capable of being clearly heard while cooking and provide solid impromptu movie-watching experience.The Huawei MateBook X Pro will cost €1,499 with a Core i5, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, €1,699 for the same processor and RAM but 512GB of storage, or €1,899 with a Core i7, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage – as tested.A UK launch and pricing has yet to be determined.For comparison, For comparison, Dell’s XPS 13 with a comparable screen and 8th generation Core i5 starts at £1,399, Microsoft’s Surface Laptop starts at £979, the Surface Book 2 starts at £1,499 and Apple’s MacBook Pro starts at £1,249.Models with discrete graphics cost more, with Microsoft’s Surface Book 2 starting at £1,999 and Apple’s 15in MacBook Pro starting at £2,349.The MateBook X Pro shows that Huawei has what it takes to build a great laptop.The screen is brilliant and the tiny bezels mean you get a very good sized display in a pretty small body – 14in, it turns out, is a great size for both work and play on a thin and light laptop. It’s not a one-trick pony, either. It has one of the best keyboards on the market, an excellent, large trackpad and solid connectivity, it is a do-it-all machine in a beautiful case.It’s not perfect, though. There’s give in the aluminium where I don’t think there should be, and the battery life is good but not class-leading. But on the whole Huawei has created something quite special here.Pros: beautiful screen, tiny bezels, slim, compact, excellent keyboard, great trackpad, USB-C, Thunderbolt 3, regular USB port, fingerprint scanner, discrete GPU, pop-up webcam, Dolby Atmos speakers that are goodCons: battery life not class-leading, no SD card slot, webcam has an up-nose angle, only two USB-C ports of which one has to charge the machine"},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

The government rejects the allegations and says it was defending itself against attacks from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army that took place in August.The Rohingya are Muslims who live in majority-Buddhist Myanmar. They are often described as the world\u0027s most persecuted minority.\u0026nbspNearly all of Myanmar\u0027s 1.1 million Rohingya live in the western coastal state of Rakhine. The government does not recognise them as citizens, effectively rendering them stateless.Extremist nationalist movements insist the group are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, although the Rohingya say they are native to Rakhine state.Rights groups accuse Burmese authorities of ethnic cleansing, systematically forcing Rohingya from the country through violence and persecution, a charge the government has denied.The two reporters have been held in Insein prison in Yangon since their arrest while facing hearings to determine whether the case will go to trial, with 17 out of 25 witnesses having given testimony.Their lawyers asked the court to dismiss the case last week, citing in part troubling discrepancies in witness statements, but the motion was swiftly rejected in a Yangon courtroom packed with supporters, family and media.“The court decided that the proposal from the defendants’ lawyer to release the defendants before all the witnesses were cross-examined has been rejected,” the judge, Ye Lwin, said.The pair had been investigating a massacre of 10 Rohingya men on 2 September in the Rakhine village of Inn Din that was carried out by security forces and local residents.The military admitted the atrocity took place and Reuters later published the story while the reporters were in prison.In a rare punishment in a country where the military has long operated with impunity, seven soldiers were sentenced to jail with hard labour for their part in the killings on Tuesday.The army has claimed the Rohingya men were terrorists, but has not presented any evidence to back up the claim. Wa Lone referred to the sentencing of the soldiers as he was being directed back into the police van after the hearing.“Those who killed people in the mass killing were given a sentence of 10 years. We were simply trying to find out the news and report this and we are facing a trial that could result in us going to prison for 14 years,” he said.One of his lawyers, Than Zaw Aung, also compared the cases: “My question is why are the journalists still in detention in prison if their report is true.”The case against the journalists has proceeded despite international calls for their release. Reuters announced last month that the prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney had joined the legal team.The president of Reuters, Stephen J Adler, said the company was deeply disappointed with the court’s decision.“We believe there are solid grounds for the court to dismiss this matter and to release our journalists. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were reporting on issues in Myanmar in an independent and impartial way,” he said. “They have not violated any laws in the course of their newsgathering and were simply doing their jobs.”Family members of the reporters were in tears after the ruling, but Wa Lone, who turned 32 on Wednesday and was brought cake by his friends, expressed optimism.“I believe in democracy. I also believe that one day we will be released because of freedom of expression,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4aff7ce1b81157c03caec0f549e180bde1d301bc/0_0_5456_3273/master/5456.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1c119d88cff786b9d0ed55b9fccb2ded 1240w","title":"new zealands human rights tribunal breaching human rights due to delays","story":"Tribunal’s chairman says system is on the brink of collapse and failing the most vulnerable because of an increase in cases The New Zealand human rights review tribunal is in crisis and on the brink of collapse because of an “exponential increase” in cases, according to a revealing letter from its chairman, who says he is overstretched and failing some of New Zealand’s most vulnerable people.Documents obtained by the New Zealand Herald include a letter from the tribunal chairman, Roger Haines, QC, to the incoming minister of justice, Andrew Little, saying the tribunal was experiencing massive delays hearing cases, had a backlog that would take five years to clear, and people’s human rights were at risk as they experienced long waits for their day in court.“The delays in the tribunal are reaching the point where the system is in danger of falling into disrepute if not collapsing,” Haines wrote.“Access to justice is being denied to almost all. For a tribunal charged with protecting human rights the situation is ironic, to say the least.”In a statement the ministry of justice said the government was reviewing how to rectify the situation, and the extreme load of responsibility on Haines who, by law, had to be a part of every panel that heard a case. The human rights review tribunal investigates alleged breaches of the human rights act, the privacy act and the health and disability act, largely relating to discrimination. In 2012-2013 the tribunal heard 36 cases, but by 2016-2017 this figure had leapt to 127. At the current rate, cases were taking 22 to 28 months from filing a complaint to first hearing, a delay Little said was not good enough. A human rights lawyer and Greens MP, Golriz Ghahraman, said the lengthy waiting time at the tribunal was a breach of human rights. “Having your case heard expediently is a human right, access to justice includes timely access to justice,” Ghahraman said.Little said there were likely to be provisions in the May budget to allow the court to function better, which may include additional employees, as well as planning for urgent legislative change before the end of the year that would allow deputies to chair hearings so the workload could be spread.“We certainly inherited this problem,” Little said. “The number of applications to the human rights review tribunal has increased quite significantly with more privacy complaints than ever before, and the resources have not been increased to allow them to do their job.”The opposition’s justice minister declined to comment.

The march of history towards economic liberalisation was irreversible, he said at another point, restating China’s commitment to free trade.Then he slipped in a Chinese proverb: “Heaven has its own law and those who embrace it will prosper.” The saying, meant to celebrate China’s unique blend of socialism and a market-driven economy, contained another message: that China would continue to play by its own rules.Xi’s remarks – his first public comments since Beijing and Washington began sparring over tariffs – at first appeared conciliatory. He pledged to further open up China’s financial services sector, lower tariffs on car imports, encourage other imports and better protect intellectual property – the latter issue being one of the key grievances of Donald Trump’s White House.But US investors and businesses have been hearing most of these promises for at least the past two years. Some of the pledges will have minimal impact. For instance, lowering import duties on cars will benefit relatively few US companies, most of which already produce and ship their vehicles from within China. Xi also promised to open up China’s shipbuilding and manufacturing sectors, though Andrew Collier, the managing director of Orient Capital Research, noted that manufacturing had been relatively accessible to foreign investors since China joined the World Trade Organisation in 2001. “Xi delivered a masterful, carefully framed, conciliatory response to Trump,” Collier said.The US president said on Tuesday after Xi’s speech that he was “very thankful” for the Chinese leader’s pledges on tariffs and the car industry. “We will make great progress together!” he tweeted.The US has threatened to impose tariffs on as much as $150bn (£105bn) of Chinese imports in response to what it says are unfair Chinese trade policies that protect domestic markets while forcing foreign companies to hand over their technology and intellectual property. China has responded with its own list of US goods it could levy, including soya beans, aircraft and other major US exports, many of which come from battleground states influential in upcoming midterm elections.“China seems to have gotten a lot of mileage from Xi’s rote statements and minor concessions that Trump has turned around and spun as evidence of his deal-making prowess,” said Eswar Prasad, a senior professor on trade policy at Cornell University in the US and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.Xi’s speech, which had been expected to set out bold reforms, was instead similar to his remarks in Davos last year. In that speech he framed China as the world’s new champion of free trade in an implicit rebuke to Trump. On Tuesday Xi again emphasised China’s commitment to economic openness. “China’s cheek is something to behold given that they are building a new international order alongside the one they pledged to leave undisturbed,” wrote Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. One of China’s key industrial policies is aimed at replacing foreign technology with domestically made components and establishing Chinese companies as global champions. Much of the White House’s tariffs target the policy, known as Made in China 2020.Xi’s comments, while offering little, may still be enough to tamp down escalating rhetoric. Some of the measures Xi named appear to be moving forward, which could also help. The People’s Bank of China said on Wednesday that previously announced moves to put foreign companies on an equal footing with domestic rivals in the financial services sector would be implemented by the end of the year.“China is laying a preliminary foundation to talk with the US,” said Pang Zhongying, a Beijing-based international relations expert. “I think the time is gradually coming for China and the US to negotiate.”Additional reporting by Wang Xueying "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb16424df71d0782e4c88c0a2c0ff3d65460dddb/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=860\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=36539f24a45ad6f9351ac39d614c18c1 1720w","title":"good news at last the world isnt as horrific as you think","story":"Training yourself how to put the news into perspective – practising ‘factfulness’ – will change your outlook for the betterThings are bad, and it feels like they are getting worse, right? War, violence, natural disasters, corruption. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer and we will soon run out of resources unless something drastic is done. That’s the picture most people in the west see in the media and carry around in their heads.I call it the overdramatic worldview. It’s stressful and misleading. In fact, the vast majority of the world’s population live somewhere in the middle of the income scale. Perhaps they are not what we think of as middle class, but they are not living in extreme poverty. Their girls go to school, their children get vaccinated. Perhaps not on every single measure, or every single year, but step by step, year by year, the world is improving. In the past two centuries, life expectancy has more than doubled. Although the world faces huge challenges, we have made tremendous progress.The overdramatic worldview draws people to the most negative answers. It is not caused simply by out-of-date knowledge. My experience, over decades of lecturing and testing, has finally brought me to see that the overdramatic worldview comes from the very way our brains work. The brain is a product of millions of years of evolution, and we are hard-wired with instincts that helped our ancestors to survive in small groups of hunters and gatherers. We crave sugar and fat, which used to be life-saving sources of energy when food was scarce. But today these cravings make obesity one of the biggest global health problems. In the same way, we are interested in gossip and dramatic stories, which used to be the only source of news and useful information. This craving for drama causes misconceptions and helps create an overdramatic worldview.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can follow up with our Further Reading guides and can also recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.comWe still need these dramatic instincts to give meaning to our world. If we sifted every input and analysed every decision rationally, a normal life would be impossible. Just as we should not cut out all sugar and fat, we should not ask a surgeon to remove the parts of our brain that deal with emotions. But we need to learn to control our drama intake.Our instinct to notice the bad more than the good is related to three things: the misremembering of the past selective reporting by journalists and activists and the feeling that as long as things are bad, it’s heartless to say they are getting better. For centuries, older people have romanticised their youths and insisted that things ain’t what they used to be. Well, that’s true. Most things used to be worse. This tendency to misremember is compounded by the never-ending negative news from across the world.Stories about gradual improvements rarely make the front page even when they occur on a dramatic scale and affect millions of people. And thanks to increasing press freedom and improving technology, we hear about more disasters than ever before. This improved reporting is itself a sign of human progress, but it creates the impression of the exact opposite. At the same time, activists and lobbyists manage to make every dip in an improving trend appear to be the end of the world, scaring us with alarmist exaggerations and prophecies. In the United States, the violent crime rate has been falling since 1990. But each time something horrific or shocking happened – pretty much every year – a crisis was reported. The majority of people believe that violent crime is getting worse.My guess is you feel that me saying that the world is getting better is like me telling you that everything is fine, and that feels ridiculous. I agree. Everything is not fine. We should still be very concerned. As long as there are plane crashes, preventable child deaths, endangered species, climate change sceptics, male chauvinists, crazy dictators, toxic waste, journalists in prison, and girls not getting an education, we cannot relax. But it is just as ridiculous to look away from the progress that has been made. The consequent loss of hope can be devastating. When people wrongly believe that nothing is improving, they may lose confidence in measures that actually work.How can we help our brains to realise that things are getting better? Think of the world as a very sick premature baby in an incubator. After a week, she is improving, but she has to stay in the incubator because her health is still critical. Does it make sense to say that the infant’s situation is improving? Yes. Does it make sense to say it is bad? Yes, absolutely. Does saying “things are improving” imply that everything is fine, and we should all not worry? Not at all: it’s both bad and better. That is how we must think about the current state of the world.Remember that the media and activists rely on drama to grab your attention that negative stories are more dramatic than positive ones and how simple it is to construct a story of crisis from a temporary dip pulled out of its context of a long-term improvement. When you hear about something terrible, calm yourself by asking: if there had been a positive improvement, would I have heard about that? Even if there had been hundreds of larger improvements, would I have heard?This is “factfulness”: understanding as a source of mental peace. Like a healthy diet and regular exercise, it can and should become part of people’s daily lives. Start to practise it, and you will make better decisions, stay alert to real dangers and possibilities, and avoid being constantly stressed about the wrong things.• Hans Rosling was a Swedish physician, academic and statistician, who died in 2017.

You don\u0027t get the tangy flavour in a lot of US cheeses which is more often than not made to put on pizzas.\u0026quot Australian party girl who faked cancer to get donations from friends and family jailed for ‘despicable’ scamTop investor who predicted recent share sell off says an \u0026#39earthquake\u0026#39 is about to hit marketsThe Syrian crisis: Is it safe to fly to Cyprus?Pope Francis comes face to face with shaggy llamas in middle of St Peter\u0026#39s SquareVictory for Bell End as council drops plans to change name of street Plastic uniforms and craft beer: A closer look at France\u0026#39s new \u0026#39airline for millennials\u0026#39Why Facebook\u0026#39s apology for fuelling anti-Rohingya violence in Burma is too little, too lateAlgeria plane crash: More than 250 killed in military jet disasterWestworld creators release funny spoof \u0026#39spoiler\u0026#39 video for season 2Burmese soldiers jailed for Rohingya massacre, as journalists who exposed atrocity remain behind bars China cracks down on bad jokes as \u0026#39vulgar\u0026#39 app shut downWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?Nottingham Cottage: Meghan and Harry\u0026#39s cosy two-bed home in KensingtonMeet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s parents and siblings who will become Prince Harry\u0026#39s familyWho is Meghan Markle?

We took time off work and planned the trip.”They set out from South Tyrol in February, walking up to 20 miles a day.“We were greeted with hospitality and a welcoming spirit,” Mr Mair said. “We were invited to stay at a number of monasteries on the route and also on private farms. The llamas need to graze and rest.”The pilgrims and their llamas are due to return home this week – but by truck, rather than retracing their route on foot.Please review our commenting policyAustralian party girl who faked cancer to get donations from friends and family jailed for ‘despicable’ scamTop investor who predicted recent share sell off says an \u0026#39earthquake\u0026#39 is about to hit marketsThe Syrian crisis: Is it safe to fly to Cyprus?Victory for Bell End as council drops plans to change name of street Plastic uniforms and craft beer: A closer look at France\u0026#39s new \u0026#39airline for millennials\u0026#39Why Facebook\u0026#39s apology for fuelling anti-Rohingya violence in Burma is too little, too lateAlgeria plane crash: More than 250 killed in military jet disasterWestworld creators release funny spoof \u0026#39spoiler\u0026#39 video for season 2Burmese soldiers jailed for Rohingya massacre, as journalists who exposed atrocity remain behind bars China cracks down on bad jokes as \u0026#39vulgar\u0026#39 app shut downWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?Nottingham Cottage: Meghan and Harry\u0026#39s cosy two-bed home in KensingtonMeet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s parents and siblings who will become Prince Harry\u0026#39s familyWho is Meghan Markle?

Moving forward to today, none of the residents and locals and those that have long standing family connections, that are known to me want this pointless change and in fact find the suggestion that it should be changed, deeply offensive.\u0026quotIf children are being bullied because of the name of their road, the problem is the bullying children, who need educating. Changing a road name will not stop their behaviour.\u0026quotLocals urged the council to leave Bell End aloneOther reports suggest the name of the road may come from a bell attached to a hunting lodge belonging to King John in the 12th century.Sandwell Council has said it has not received copies of either petition and does not have plans to change the name of the road.Labour Councillor Chris Tranter, who represents the Rowley ward, said: \u0026quotOf course it\u0027s been saved - nobody wants it changed.\u0026quotI have lived here for 40 years and I was born in the house next door.\u0026quotYou get the odd giggle on the phone, it is quite amusing really.\u0026quotOne resident, who did not want to be named, said last month: \u0026quotIt was all very funny until I heard a few of the children on the street were being bullied at school.\u0026quotIt\u0027s not their fault where they live. I think the road name should be changed to something less silly.\u0026quotIt does concern me that house prices are being undermined as well. I can understand the name might put some people off.\u0026quotThree years ago, the road - which has an average property value of £125,500 - was placed in the top 15 list for rude sounding place names.A study revealed that semi-detached homes on the street sell for £60,000 less than a similar property on nearby Uplands Avenue.Please review our commenting policySouth Korean kills neighbour\u0026#39s noisy corgi and feeds it to him unwittinglyAustralian party girl who faked cancer to get donations from friends and family jailed for ‘despicable’ scamTop investor who predicted recent share sell off says an \u0026#39earthquake\u0026#39 is about to hit marketsThe Syrian crisis: Is it safe to fly to Cyprus?Pope Francis comes face to face with shaggy llamas in middle of St Peter\u0026#39s SquarePlastic uniforms and craft beer: A closer look at France\u0026#39s new \u0026#39airline for millennials\u0026#39Why Facebook\u0026#39s apology for fuelling anti-Rohingya violence in Burma is too little, too lateAlgeria plane crash: More than 250 killed in military jet disasterWestworld creators release funny spoof \u0026#39spoiler\u0026#39 video for season 2Burmese soldiers jailed for Rohingya massacre, as journalists who exposed atrocity remain behind bars China cracks down on bad jokes as \u0026#39vulgar\u0026#39 app shut downWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?Nottingham Cottage: Meghan and Harry\u0026#39s cosy two-bed home in KensingtonMeet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s parents and siblings who will become Prince Harry\u0026#39s familyWho is Meghan Markle?
