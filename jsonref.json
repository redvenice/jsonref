He asked each participant to find a photograph of themselves with their lost loved one, and they returned to the location to replicate the image. The project aims to provide a platform, allowing others to acknowledge their loss, and to celebrate the person they loveDeath has a stigma and the burden of grief can hold us captive if we let it. May this be a process through which a loved one can be remembered and through which memories can be relived. Even though the pain of the loss may remain, may this go some way in relieving the hurt and the stigma of death and act as a public declaration that death has lost its sting.I ask each participant to find a photograph of themselves with their lost loved one. We then return to the location of the original photograph to replicate the image.It is a chance to think back and remember, to tell the story of that day and of the person that they have lost. Imagery allows for expression beyond what we can speak of. I hope it is an experience that contributes to the restorative process in overcoming the painful impact of loss.We all have a different experience of loss that can reveal itself in many ways. Sometimes it’s a response that is quite clear for those around you to see. Perhaps there are lots of emotions that they just don’t know how to let out, they’re not sure how they should be feeling or whether it’s right to be having certain angry or complicated thoughts.It’s not about having the best photo, saying the right thing or having the answers, I just want to give people a chance to speak about their experience of loss.My aim was that the combination of the photos we took and the conversations we had, we would be able to portray a deep personal story. This allows other people who are struggling and going through similar experiences to look through and find strength and comfort in the story, knowing that other people have been through it and are confident enough to share their story.I lost my father to prostate cancer in December 2009. When my dad died, it wounded me in the deepest part of my being. The loss shaped the following few years of my life and will continue to do so, but I don’t have to let it define who I am. Through this time, it was really helpful to be able to talk about my dad. I wanted to share with others about the person he was, the emotions I was feeling as I processed the grief, and talk about the influence he had – and continues to have – on my life. Those conversations were often hard and few and far between, mainly because people just didn’t quite know how to respond.I’m Alistair, and my dad was James. The original picture was from the beach at Swanage in Dorset. I’m not sure how old I was there, but it was a family holiday. We loved to go down there and find a pitch for the day, Mum and Dad would soak up the sun and me and Tim, my brother, would build sandcastles and splash around, and repeat until we had to go home.He was a very loving father, he provided for his family, looked after us. He taught me a lot of principles about always doing the best, always trying to be the nicest person and to make sure that others were looked after and cared for. When you look back you realise you’ve been prepared by your parents to live your life. Dad always just wanted to treat others how he’d want to be treated.When we got the dementia diagnosis, several years ago, we had noticed over time that he was getting more forgetful. He wouldn’t use my name, he was losing his hearing, his vision wasn’t great and I lost him as a dad over those years. I still loved him as my dad, but I knew I wasn’t necessarily going to get that reciprocated, which was tough. He still offered to help when I mentioned to him about moving flat he’d say “well let me know if you need a hand”. I think that’s just his character through and through and I always just try to emulate that.I went to see him in the care home and I said to the staff that I’d like to volunteer in the garden if possible, even if he wasn’t aware of me being there, I could just help out and spend some time with him, but then we went into lockdown and that was the last time I saw him when he was awake and alert.When the Covid thing came along, it was like losing him for a second time, but this time, obviously, for the last time. It was difficult because I had kind of processed losing him in a mental sense, and now I was losing him in a physical sense.I did get to see him before he passed away and it was just a completely different experience because I had to wear all the PPE. In the past, I’d just always assumed he’d be there for years to come and you don’t think about it ever being the last time, whereas I went there, got dressed up and they said you’ve got 15 minutes. It was horrible having this countdown clock, where you have this time limit on how long you have left with someone. I just set it on my watch and it’s just counting down. I was thinking, I’ve got 30 seconds left with my dad, 20 seconds left, 10 seconds left. What do I do? What do I say? And I just panicked.It made me reflect on how many times I’ve seen or called my parents and thought that maybe I’m quite busy and I haven’t really got time for this, but I’ll see them next week. I’ve gone away thinking that it’s OK that I didn’t see them for very long today because I’ll see them in the future.It’s given me a real appreciation for just taking a second to appreciate that when you’re with family or a friend, that you don’t know necessarily when you might see them again and that’s why you have to make the most of the time you have with them. I’m trying to act on it in a positive way, rather than just thinking about why I feel that way because of Dad.It’s absolutely OK to cry and be a blubbering mess sometimes. If you try to stop it, you’ll feel a lot worse. I know that particularly for men there’s this societal pressure to be a strong support and a rock for people, but for your own sake, for men and women, to let your body do what it needs to do. You want to cry because your brain is telling you that you need to process this, to not fight it but to let it happen, then you’ll feel that pressure is unloaded.My name is Jonathan. The picture of myself and dad was taken on Christmas Eve 2019. We’d had Christmas together for the previous 54 years and it was a tradition we never broke. It was a fabulous event, we went out for a meal and then came back and exchanged gifts here.My dad was 88 and he was getting old, things were failing. As a son it’s really upsetting when parents get older. I would do anything to try and make his life easier. I saw that he was walking badly and he said that the flesh on his feet was getting thinner and thinner and it was painful to walk. He’d never been into a Nike store, but he hobbled in, and then pretty soon we were having him trying on lots of pairs and we fitted him up with a pair of Nike Air Max. He was virtually running around the store, which was really lovely, really heartening. I felt as though I’d knocked off 10 or 15 years!He was so busy, I couldn’t keep up with him. I’m half his age, but he was out every night of the week. He would attend choirs, he was in the Greater Manchester Police Choir, the church choir, he was in Probus. I just don’t think he liked being at home.He was the person I’d known longest in my life, he was always there. He was a bit like Switzerland, he never really offered a view, but he was always there to support me and catch me if I fell or tripped. It’s three months since he died and I’ve spent the last three months going to call him every day. So it’s been difficult.He was the 12th coronavirus victim in the UK, so it was right at the very start. The health service and society as a whole didn’t know what to do. They didn’t know how to process and deal with the virus at that stage. So that was really difficult, because we couldn’t go to see him. We were only allowed to see him at the very end with lots of protective equipment, but if he hadn’t have had the coronavirus he probably would have been here today, because they would have treated his underlying health issues. It’s really, really difficult.He died on Friday 13th, which I just couldn’t believe. The last time I saw him, we’d had a chat and I’d said what a cool dad he was, that he’d done a really good job, and he said, “No, I don’t think I was that good”, which I thought was really sweet. I said goodbye to him and went into the anteroom, where I had to take off all the protective equipment. I was halfway through taking it off and he called me back, but I couldn’t go back because the room had a positive air pressure, so I’ll never know what he wanted me for. That went with him to the grave.It sounds really strange, but it’ll be very odd when the pandemic ends, because it has felt like a very intimate time, in that we went into shutdown and I could think about my dad’s experience, but it was like a shared experience with the whole of the world. I dread to think of other families going through the same thing that we went through. When someone dies of cancer or a heart attack, it’s dreadful, but that’s the moment. Whereas my dad died on the 13 March and from that point on, coronavirus has been on the news every minute of every hour of every day. It was like someone sticking a knife into the wound all the time, there was no escaping from it. As a family we felt properly battered.Normally if you suffer a bereavement you have the support of family and friends, and we couldn’t go and see anyone. We were in lockdown before the country, in our own lockdown, so it’s been a very lonely time. Every step along the way was difficult, it felt as though we were unfortunate pioneers. The first funeral director that we went to wouldn’t deal with us. It’s been unusual.At his funeral, we only had 10 people there and I liked it because it was nice and quiet. I’d discovered tapes of him singing so we actually played him singing a song on the way out and it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. That was really magical.My name is Philip and the photograph is of me and my parents. We bought this caravan in 2016, and they were very much part of our lives, so they would come for a weekend. We are in the very north of Anglesey. If you think of the island as a clock, then we’re at 1 o’clock, overlooking the most northerly lighthouse, Point Lynas.My dad was a travelling salesman for James Stewart and Co in Ardwick, opposite Manchester Apollo. His turf was Moss Side. He used to sell from a catalogue going door to door and he was well known in the area. He did that for 30-odd years.My mum brought us up, two boys who liked to fight and liked to be boys. She was also the bursar at the Ryleys school in Alderley Edge, and was very into amateur dramatics, so was part of the Wilmslow Green Room Society. She was in a lot of plays, then did a lot of backstage and in her older years did a lot of wardrobe, so there’s a team of six that meet every Tuesday to talk and sort the wardrobes out.Mum had coughs, she definitely had Covid.She was fit and healthy, walking a mile a day, in the drama group. Dad was playing golf and doing the garden, but he died of a broken heart, basically. Even though he did test positive, he never had a cough or any real symptoms. I lost both parents in 48 hours. My family is my world, so the only reassurance is that we were telling them to stay in, eat and have the paracetamol and do what the doctor says, that they’d get through it and to be strong.My brother still lived with my parents and had to give CPR to both of them. They were in lockdown, so even after both parents dying, Peter had to stay in the house for another five days and we weren’t allowed to visit. It’s all that stuff that you don’t hear about and have no idea what people are going through. To this day, he has not had any symptoms. He’s never been tested, nobody approached him, but he’s never had a day of illness. We were only allowed 10 people at the funeral when we could have had 200. We printed 100 orders of service and posted them out to different people, just so there was something for them to share on the day. We did a video, so we can share that with people, but obviously nobody got the funeral that they wanted.For the first three weeks after my parents died, I became a bit of a counsellor. People would ring me up and I’d have to explain everything and say well, we have to look for the silver lining in it all, we have to find something every day that helps and is a positive. We’ve done that, we have managed to find that glimmer, even little quirky things, memories of them, thoughts of them.I suppose the only comfort is that there isn’t an answer. There isn’t something that we could or should have done to make the result anything different than what it was, because nobody had that knowledge. Everybody was scared and there are still friends of my mum and dad that haven’t gone out.We summed it up quite nicely in that if somebody else came into the room, that person became the most important person. So it was never about them, they were the host and hostess. Drop everything, someone’s come in, what can I do for you, get you a drink, something to eat, oven on, and we’ll look after you, tell us what’s going on in your life, is there something we can help with?I used to sit and watch every United game with my dad, we were avid football fans and we’d chat away, so the first time I watched United I put a glass of white wine next to me. That’s what makes it tough sometimes, those chats, those little bits that fill in your week. It’s good to talk it out, you have to do that.I’m just so pleased that they saw both my daughters get firsts, graduate and be in the jobs they want to be in. They burst with pride about my girls. I’ve tried to do the best to acknowledge them and pay them tribute, and if we can be half the people they were, then we’re doing a good job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d7e0bf020385a47d51b259f390f24c6b68ddad6/419_222_2721_1632/master/2721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4632d1b8d55753fa79efb627847a603","title":"picture essay america 1930s post office murals","story":"Photographer Justin Hamel stumbled on a Great Depression-era mural one day in a New York post office, and was intrigued to learn there are 1,200 of them across the countryThe instinct to try to boost morale during a time of hardship and suffering resonates today as we face the pandemic and economic recession.Modeled on the 1933 Public Works Art Project, the federal government created the Treasury Section of Painting and Sculpture a year later (the name was subsequently changed to the Section of Fine Arts).These programs were designed to employ artists.The mission of the post office murals was multifaceted – to boost morale in communities, employ artists by the thousands and create world-class art that was accessible to everyone. The murals revolved around local folklore, landscapes, industry and, unsurprisingly, mail delivery. They told the story of life across the United States.The first mural I photographed occurred by happenstance – I stumbled upon a mural depicting the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. From there the project slowly grew, as I traveled around the country seeking out the unique art of the post office mural.I’ve now photographed about 325 inidual murals though I don’t have an actual tally.From the magnificent depiction of steam engines being built in the post office in Willard, Ohio, to a serene pondside landscape hanging in the sheriff’s office in Dale county, Alabama, or covered wagons crossing a stream in Crawford, Nebraska, each new mural I discovered offered an engaging view into the local histories of the world around us.In small towns everywhere, history was painted by people who arrived in America seeking a better life. Many of the artists employed by the Section were immigrants. José Aceves, a Mexican-American artist, painted the classic western scene Big City News in Borger, Texas.New and Old Methods of Transportation, showing how the rapid pace at which technology was changing rural towns, was painted by the Polish-American Bernard Zakheim in Mineola, Texas. In a Virginia post office lobby, you’ll find a factory valley landscape entitled Appalachia by Lucienne Bloch, a Swiss-born immigrant.As today’s national discussion in the US has shifted towards institutional racism and the place of art and statues commemorating the United States’ racist history, many post office murals are coming under scrutiny for the way they portray the colonization and slavery. Hollis Holbrook’s John Elliot Speaks to the Natick Indians depicts Native Americans enslaved by Puritans while John Elliot preaches Christianity to them.The city of Natick was founded as the first of many “praying towns” by the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where Native Americans would be forced to learn Christianity.However, the controversy surrounding post office murals is arguably nothing new. In the 1950s, a handful of artists were made to testify under the House committee on un-American activities for their celebration of labor and political undertones.Victor Arnautoff’s historic 10-panel The Life of Washington mural at the George Washington high school in San Francisco is in the midst of a fierce fight to be preserved, hidden or destroyed due to its depictions of George Washington as a slave owner and the dead Native Americans the country was founded upon. Hundreds of murals created under the Section of Fine Arts and the broader Works Progress Administration have been lost or purposely destroyed over the years.The Section of Fine Arts created roughly 1,400 murals and sculptures in federal buildings, not entirely post offices. The PWAP, Treasury Relief Art and Federal Art Project commissioned thousands of other paintings, posters, general art classes, etc, including post office murals.All wrapped into one, it is undoubtedly the largest public art project in the US. The most recent politicization of the post office has brought renewed focus to the ways the postal service is crucial to everyday life. Perhaps an unexpected consequence, scaling back hours and funding will also put this unparalleled collection of public art at risk.• Justin Hamel is a documentary and editorial photographer in El Paso, Texas, working at the intersections of climate, labor and migration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8829c9aaceee8d7d6c89ad59f8993f368775fa8f/0_198_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d12c27d0ee1dbfff0a5410a1215374c8","title":"the big picture a tender family moment with jfk","story":"A candid shot of the young senator by Life magazine’s Ed Clark portrayed him as a man to lead a new generation into a new decadeEd Clark, a Life magazine staff photographer, was commissioned to photograph the Kennedy family at home in Georgetown in 1958. JFK was campaigning to be elected to a second term as Massachusetts’s senator and, if successful, there were strong rumours that he would make a run for the presidency in 1960. After several days taking pictures of husband and wife, Clark asked over lunch at the house if he could get a picture of the senator with his baby daughter, Caroline. “Jackie said no,” he recalled, “that she was upstairs asleep. But Jack bounded up the stairs, and I followed.”Clark took a spontaneous roll of film up in the nursery. It included this picture capturing the moment Caroline woke up, wide-eyed with delight to see her father. The nation was starting to share that excitement. Clark’s cover story for Life did much to advance the growing conviction that Kennedy was a leader for a new generation and a new decade. Up until that moment, presidents were far more likely to be grandparents than new dads, and family photographs were largely awkwardly staged compositions.Clark, who was based in Tennessee, had made his name in the aftermath of war, photographing the Nuremberg trials, and the bombed-out ruins of Germany and France. In 1962, aged only 51 and at the height of his powers, he was forced to give up his career at Life because of failing eyesight. A new surgical procedure partly restored his vision in 1980 and he returned to photography for the remaining 20 years of his life. The picture of Caroline Kennedy in her crib is included in a new book taken from the photographer’s personal archive. When he became president, JFK hung Clark’s picture in pride of place in the Oval Office Jackie purchased 75 prints.

After almost two decades, the supermarket’s deal with online grocer Ocado draws to a close at the end of August.Ocado ditched Waitrose in favour of a new contract with Marks \u0026amp Spencer, meaning Waitrose customers need to register with waitrose to order groceries online.Waitrose has invested £100m in its online offer, including the opening of a second fulfilment centre in Enfield, north London, which has helped it to double online orders, with a third site scheduled to open at the end of the year.An effective loyalty scheme may be one way to reward shoppers if the price match promise is ditched, independent retail analyst Richard Hyman said, adding that John Lewis would never be able to market itself as the cheapest place to shop.As part of its plans to remodel its business following the coronavirus crisis, John Lewis has launched a furniture rental scheme.A few days after it began to offer 50 items from its range, including sofas, beds and coffee tables, through a third-party site, Fat Llama, the majority were already sold out.The scheme makes sense for John Lewis, said retail analyst Kate Hardcastle, but she does not believe it is the main way for the group to transform its business in a retail landscape increasingly dominated by Amazon.“One thing the high street has fallen back on is expertise, its service,” said Hardcastle, adding that customers, especially those aged 40 and older, would also pay for advice.“A John Lewis customer tends to be my age and up, I’m in my 40s, I don’t have all the answers and I would quite like a conversation with someone. With 40 to 50 years of buying left, that’s a pretty solid market to go into.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a626e46ed99243ec658e348f4a72e6bfecf8426/0_101_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e063d20cea2fb8d7dafca60621f8e05b","title":"the guardian view on coronavirus rules making sense of complexity","story":"People will be more willing to comply with regulations they understand and respect. That means explaining the choices we are makingThis spring, Singapore’s government issued a pandemic decree that sounded both logical and faintly comical: hair salons could offer simple trims, but not elaborate styles. It captured some of the difficulty of balancing people’s needs and wishes with the urgency of containing the spread of coronavirus. It was also a reminder that regulations must not only reflect what is possible in health terms but what is graspable and acceptable – perhaps easier in a highly rule-bound society like Singapore’s.As winter approaches, keeping infection rates down will only get tougher. But when lockdown started, everyone knew what they had to do. The simple message to stay at home has since been superseded by a mass of specific guidance, frequently changed and often very poorly communicated. Now, not only the four nations but also cities and even wards are under different obligations. The complexity is the necessary result of highly variable rates of infection in different places, as well as of political choices. But even the best intentioned are confused about what is and is not permitted. Others don’t seem to care.One issue is the lack of explicit discussion by politicians of the choices we are making. In Oldham, Blackburn and parts of Pendle, residents have been told not to socialise with anyone from outside their household, even in gardens or parks. Yet pubs and restaurants remain open. In Birmingham, where people have been asked to restrict visitors to their home, the council leader says that data shows outbreaks have occurred in workplaces and the hospitality sector too. We should not be surprised when people struggle to make sense of these rules. The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, has been more candid about trade-offs. In some places, pubs and shops may have to close so that schools can reopen, he has warned. Parents and staff have sensible concerns about the return to school that must be addressed, especially given the lack of guidance over what will happen if there is an outbreak and the World Health Organization’s call for children over 12 to wear masks. But the prioritisation of education is right: the suspension of schooling has been damaging for children, especially the poorest, and has left many adults unable to work.What we should not accept is the crude idea of a choice between lives and livelihoods. As punitive as lockdown has been, top economists have warned that a premature easing could trigger a higher death toll and deeper recession. Three things are clear. First, the government’s rush to reopen squandered the opportunity to suppress infections more substantially and sent the wrong message to the public – caution must now be paramount. Second, we need better testing and tracing, which is critical to containing outbreaks the performance of outsourcing companies is woefully inadequate. Finally, the public must be better consulted and informed about choices: it helps when people know not only what the rules are, but why. An information campaign should include, for example, efforts to reshape norms around masks – greater compliance should allow greater mixing. People have shown their willingness to comply with tough rules when it is necessary, but they will not follow those that they do not understand or believe in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9badd696cf7250b942409a58df622affc1797640/0_289_4335_2601/master/4335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=602a2b8c1e724b8e0c625a814c0ebe58","title":"teachers and parents across the uk share your thoughts on the reopening of schools","story":"We’d like to hear from people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland about returning to schools, and those in Scotland about how it has beenWith just weeks to go until children return to school in England and Wales, and less than a week until the first cohort of students in Northern Ireland return for the start of the new academic year, protective measures in schools remain fiercely contested.Many teachers have criticised the government’s ‘bubble’ group scheme and social distancing measures, while some unions have called for teachers to be able to choose to use face coverings, against government advice.

Instead, computer modelling was used to assign grades. But when results were unveiled, there was shock and anger at what looked like clear injustices After all end-of-year exams were scrapped, students in England with offers of university places were awaiting their A-level results with more trepidation than usual. Rather than being judged by their exam performance, their grades had been assigned by a computer model that took into account their previous achievements and that of their school.  As Laura McInerney tells Mythili Rao, while at first glance the results last week looked in line with a normal school year, glaring anomalies and what looked to be huge injustices emerged. As pressure built on the government to explain itself, ministers went silent before the education secretary emerged on Monday to announce a major U-turn.  Students who had been downgraded could now use the grades their schools had predicted. But as university places fill up, some are finding it is too little too late.

What drove him to beam messages and music, from Can to Coltrane, into space?In the mid-1960s, when he was a boy living in rural Michigan, John Shepherd began thinking of ways to make contact with alien life forms. “It was round about the time that a show called The Outer Limits was on television,” he recalls. “I remember being fascinated by the idea of somehow building my own scientific instruments to explore the mysterious phenomenon that is extraterrestrial life.”In 1972, from the living room of his grandparent’s house, he began chasing his dream by broadcasting a series of electronic tone pulses “towards the stars”. So began an extraordinary 30-year journey he called Project STRAT (Special Telemetry Research and Tracking). It would soon take over his life, and the lives of his grandparents, who found themselves living amid an expanding array of what he calls “beautiful and unusual instruments”, including dual-channel oscillators, cathode-ray tubes, giant screens to monitor incoming signals and a low frequency transmitter sending signals millions of miles into deep space.Though he had little money, he trawled military surplus sales and a wholesale electrical warehouse in nearby Traverse City, collecting the materials he needed. In the garden, he erected “a two-storey 150,000 volt output stage” mounted on a pair of tall metal towers made from salvage that included a dismantled ski-lift. In the living room, scientific equipment was arranged, floor to ceiling, along one wall.“Often, people passing by at night in their cars would see a bank of lights blinking in the living room and they’d pull over to stop and stare,” he says. “Maybe they had been watching The Outer Limits, too, and they were wondering what was going on. I remember some people even thought we had built a Russian spy system.”Last Thursday, Netflix premiered an intriguing short film called John Was Trying to Contact Aliens, which earlier this year won the prize for best documentary short at the Sundance festival. Shot, edited and directed by Matthew Killip, son of the revered British documentary photographer, Chris Killip, it distils Shepherd’s 30-year quest into just 16 magical minutes.“I wanted to tell his story economically and sparely, while keeping some of the mystery intact,” says Killip. “John is a wonderful subject but there is something mysterious and guarded about him that may stem from his troubled early life. I tried to balance that narrative with his extraordinary obsession, which lies somewhere between the realms of science and outsider art. The more I thought about what he did, the more it seemed like an elaborate 30-year art performance.”In the 1970s, Shepherd’s obsession intermittently drew local reporters to his door. In 1989, he was even granted his 15 minutes of nationwide fame with an appearance on The Joan Rivers Show. On YouTube, you can see him, squeezed between two other ufologists, an intense young man with long hair and a beard, explaining his mission to his somewhat sceptical host, who points out that, after 16 years, the ETs have still not returned his calls.By then, with the help of his grandmother Irene’s life savings, Shepherd had constructed a spacious two-story laboratory next to his grandparents’ house. “While my body was in the local community,” he tells Killip, “my mind was in space and in other realms, travelling the cosmos.” Flickering home-movie footage from that time reveals a futuristic interior filled with screens, consoles and arrays of beeping lights: the Starship Enterprise transposed to small-town Michigan.Using a giant transmitter in the front garden, he began beaming music into space for several hours a day, from the likes of Sun Ra, Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane alongside German experimentalists such as Can, Cluster and Harmonia. At one point, we see the young Shepherd leaning intently into the microphone and announcing to the cosmos: “Now, we’re now going to bring you some Afro-pop to warm up your evening.”Killip first became aware of Shepherd when he was perusing a book about UFO cults and saw a photograph of “a long-haired young man surrounded by banks of machinery with his grandma sitting beside him, knitting”. Between working at his day job as a film editor for the likes of artist Jeremy Deller, Killip had made a short film called Master of Reality about another American teenager outsider, Ronny Long, whose obsessions included wrestling and horror movies. “There were certain similarities in terms of their extreme single-mindedness,” he says.In Killip’s tenderly observed portrait, Shepherd emerges as a sensitive soul, aware of his otherness and yet at one with it. The narrative touches briefly on his troubled early childhood – a father who left soon after he was born and an emotionally distant mother with whom he has had very little contact. “Things were rough in the early years,” he tells Killip, “My grandma felt sorry for me and took me with her.” At 12, Shepherd realised he was gay, which, he says in his inimitably understated way, proved “rather difficult” in rural Michigan in the early 1960s.“I think if you have a troubled early life it does make for a more explorative journey,” he tells me matter-of-factly. “It certainly made me independent in a way and encouraged me to expand my horizons.”“Most of what I did was self-taught, but my grandfather, who had worked as a toolmaker in Detroit, helped me with the often very precise practical stuff. It was my grandmother, though, who shared my interest in, how shall I put it, more exotic subjects. She definitely had a feeling for it and she brought a lot of inspiration into my life.” (Irene died in 1988 and the film is dedicated to her.)In a moment of poignant self-reflection in the film, Shepherd compares his life’s journey to a trek along “a lonely mountain road”. That changed when he met his partner, John Litrenta, in 1993. They live, he says, “a quiet life on a lakefront house between two small towns”.In 1998, due to lack of funds, Shepherd reluctantly dismantled his lab and put everything in storage, where it remains. He guides Killip through the jumbled space with a flashlight, pointing out his beloved machinery – satellite communication equipment, high-powered microwave tubes, a high-voltage transmitter accelerator. “These are just the remnants,” he says, “the leftover pieces of thought.”“I miss it,” he tells me, “I really do, but I saved it all. It’s like a collection of beautiful objects. Waiting.”In the film, he describes his long, strange creative endeavour as “a kind of dream state” that imbued his life with meaning. And, on the clip from the Rivers show, when she mentions his lack of success, he replies: “Like an artist can continue to paint even if he doesn’t sell his paintings, I can continue to build equipment and work on ideas.” Does he think, in retrospect, he was a conceptual artist as much as a scientist? “I guess so,” he says, quietly. “An artist of sound and light and electricity. And a maverick. Definitely a maverick. That would be a pretty good description.”John Was Trying to Contact Aliens is on Netflix"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2235437c4f05a6d14e53e8b6e7075d22ac6f96d/0_239_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3201552d4a48adf38c4573efac7ac53d","title":"how britains covid 19 panic buyers triggered a tinned food renaissance","story":"It started with tinned tomatoes, symbolically stripped from supermarket shelves in the panic-buying frenzy of the early days of the pandemic.But lockdown has led to a wider renaissance of canned food as shoppers have embraced staples from spam and corned beef to beans, pulses and fish, all enjoying a popularity not seen since the rationing of the second world war.Typically tucked away at the back of the cupboard and dusted off when needed, tinned food – despite the best efforts of self-styled “Queen of thrift” Jack Monroe to make it fashionable – had fallen out of favour.Waitrose executive chef Martyn Lee said: “Tinned tomatoes, beans and baked beans are obvious staples, but there are also excellent-quality tinned fish and meats for quick lunches, tinned artichokes for delicious antipasti, and a whole spectrum of fruits that can provide the base of a dessert as easy or extravagant as you like.”Now major brands such as Princes, Batchelors and Branston are keen to sustain long-term interest in their canned products, shaking off the wartime association and signing up award-winning chefs and influencers to help provide recipe inspiration – particularly to the younger generation.While the summer’s seasonal food festivals have been cancelled due to coronavirus, the UK’s first festival devoted solely to canned food kicks off on Monday on Instagram. The four-day event is free but virtual visitors are urged to help families struggling to afford to eat and relying on food banks by making a donation to its charity partner, the food redistribution charity FareShare.Hosting the so-called Love Canned Food festival is Michelin-starred TV chef Phil Vickery, who, in a live cook-along session, will be rustling up a five-bean (canned, of course) dal.“My parents grew up in the war years and, as a treat, my grandma used to serve up canned salmon with pickled onions – apparently the height of sophistication,” he said. “Today, I like to use tinned vegetables such as spinach, potatoes and chickpeas to make a quick and tasty curry, while a rice pilaf made with canned pork is also a favourite.”Also beamed in live from his kitchen will be budget chef Miguel Barclay – he claims to be able to create a gourmet meal for £1 – who believes “quick and easy recipes with a twist” are central to the longer-term revival of tinned foods. “I am a big fan of corned beef,” he says, “but for a long time it has been relegated to the bottom supermarket shelf. It’s becoming a lot cooler now, and one of my favourite recipes is a shakshuka-style Mexican corned-beef hash, which is finished off with little fried eggs and fresh herbs. It taps into the whole ‘yolk porn’ trend on social media.”On the eve of the return of schools, another cookalong will feature blogger Emily Leary (A Mummy Too) and Adam Shaw (At Dad’s Table) to share tips for lunchboxes and family meals.Nick Saltmarsh, managing director of Hodmedod, a Suffolk-based pioneer of British-grown pulses and grains – both dried and canned – said: “We’ve long thought that cans are underappreciated as a way of preserving cooked food, not least because the cans themselves are very easy and efficient to recycle.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9879cace1579ea1f5877ecad778cfc1061b9ae63/22_0_5077_3047/master/5077.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d97443e92145f0fb79e6c40040ffba99","title":"bayern munich paris saint germain psg champions league final match report","story":"When Kingsley Coman stole into space at the far post, he knew that the right ball from Joshua Kimmich could give him the opportunity he had dreamed of. The Champions League final had been tight and tense, with a few chances for either team but, until this point, no clinical edge.That was about to change. Kimmich’s cross was perfect and Coman’s eyes lit up. There was a time when his ambition had been to win Europe’s elite competition with Paris Saint-Germain, his hometown club and the one where he began his career as a trainee.But here, he wore the red of Bayern Munich and, when he directed the header past Keylor Navas, he had put them on their way to a sixth triumph in this tournament. It was a triumph that they just about deserved and represented a fairytale finale to Hansi Flick’s first season in charge. His record is simply breathtaking.It was a first ever appearance for PSG in this showpiece and they might have driven a different ending. They shaded the first-half, when they created good openings, and they were still fighting in stoppage-time at the end, when Neymar almost forced an equaliser. His tears at full-time spoke of heartbreak.It had been difficult to imagine a higher pedigree final, certainly in terms of the form that each club brought to the Estádio da Luz. Bayern kicked off with 32 wins and one defeat in 35 matches in all competitions under Hansi Flick, who was appointed in early November while for PSG, in the same timeframe, it was 28 wins and one loss in 32 games. Bayern had done the domestic double their opponents the domestic treble. Something had to give.Bayern were always going to hold a high defensive line, to set a fast tempo and try to assert themselves in the PSG half. And, equally, the French champions were always going to try to get their pacy forwards in behind the Bayern backline.The spaces that Bayern give up are a consequence of their attacking style and PSG exploited them. They had a number of flickers during the first-half, with clear chances for Neymar, Àngel Di María and Kylian Mbappé.Neymar’s opportunity followed a pass from Mbappé that left him with only Manuel Neuer to beat from an angle inside the left of the area – the goalkeeper blocked with his leg – while Di María’s opening came on 24 minutes, following a rapid thrust from halfway, led by Neymar. After Di María exchanged passes with Ander Herrera, his drive was just too high.Mbappé’s effort was in the gilt-edged category. With PSG pressing high, David Alaba played a loose pass straight to Mbappé and when he got it back from Herrera, he had time and space eight yards out. He scuffed tamely at Neuer.One of the many fascinating dynamics was Bayern’s rich experience of these type of occasions and PSG’s lack of it. Whereas the Germans were making an 11th appearance in the final of this tournament, PSG had previously appeared in just two European finals, each of them in the now defunct Cup Winners’ Cup. They beat Rapid Vienna in 1996 and lost to Barcelona in 1997.PSG’s journey under Qatari Sports Investments has been well told and they were a Europa League club during the company’s first season at the helm – back in 2011-12 – when they could not escape a group that featured Athletic Bilbao, Red Bull Salzburg and Slovan Bratislava. That felt as though from a different age, particularly when the star quality of their current line-up was factored in.The simmering tension was underscored by the presence of so many potential match-winners and for Bayern, there was nobody more obvious than Robert Lewandowski. He had two first-half chances, the first after he took a lovely touch to kill a cross from Alphonso Davies. Spinning, he jabbed a low, bouncing shot against the post, with Keylor Navas beaten.Lewandowski would work Navas with a header on 31 minutes and Bayern finished the half with Kingsley Coman screaming for a penalty after he had outstripped Thilo Kehrer. There was contact from the PSG right-back but not enough to sway the referee, Daniele Orsato.Coman appeared to go to ground a little too easily but the replays did show that Kehrer had clipped his heel, as well as putting a hand on his shoulder. The clip was difficult to see in real time and, in VAR terms, not in the clear and obvious bracket.The pre-match prediction had been for a high-scoring encounter but with the stakes so high, there were understandable nerves and, as the minutes ticked down, the realisation that one error could prove decisive.The breakthrough, though, owed more to a burst of Bayern slickness. It was a wonderful team goal, with Joshua Kimmich central to its creation. He fired the move with a pass to Serge Gnabry, who played it inside to Thomas Müller and watched his teammate work it back to Kimmich on the right-hand side. The cross was deep and perfectly flighted and Coman was a snapshot in composure as he guided the header past Navas.Bayern had PSG on the rocks and, more specifically, Coman had Kehrer where he wanted him and so it was a surprise when Flick took him off. What did PSG have left? Di María played in Marquinhos, who was denied by another big Neuer block, and there was controversy when Kimmich appeared to catch Mbappé inside the area. No penalty, said Orsato. The glory belonged to Coman and Bayern."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e20476ee8bf13b00d8acbd656283f02ae21d5600/0_210_3070_1842/master/3070.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc5d079eb7315b1acc4cd7f752959617","title":"paris saint germain 0 1 bayern munich champions league final player ratings","story":"Kingsley Coman and Manuel Neuer shone but it was a difficult night for Neymar and Kylian MbappéKeylor Navas 6 The Costa Rican returned from a hamstring injury but could not stop Coman’s header.Thilo Kehrer 4The German right-back struggled to contain Coman and was lucky not to concede a penalty.Thiago Silva 7The 35-year-old did not let himself down before his likely exit from PSG.

Then Neuer steps towards the trophy. No chance of him dropping it! He hoists it high to the sky and his teammates bounce and sing as confetti explodes around them. The stadium is practically empty but their joy is unconfined. Now they’ll be straight on to their phones to read David Hytner’s match report: The suits are out in force to make the trophy presentation. But first they’ve to had the consolation medals to the runners-up. They get clapped on to the podium by their conquerors. They look deeply peeved - perhaps they will drink in this pain and use it to come back stronger? Bayern players exult, hugging each other and slapping backs all over the pitch. PSG players stare forlorn into the distance. They had their chances in the first half, when Neymar and Mbappe failed to find sharp finishes. And then they were undone by a Frenchman who used to be in their academy, as the excellent Coman headed home from a cross by Kimmich. Bayern Munich are European champions for the sixth time, equalling the haul of Liverpool! PSG are this season’s Tottenham Hotspur.90+4 min: Bayern have freekick to the right of the PSG box. They take it short and Coutinho tries to shield the ball to waste time.... but he coughs it up easily and suddenly PSG are streaking free down the other end. Neymar curls in a delicious cross from the left .... and Davies puts on enough pressure to prevent from Choupo-Moting from getting on the end of it!90+2 min: At least three minutes left in time added on...90+1 min: Action stations! Lewandowski is denied by a crucial table at one by Kehrer then PSG hurtle down the other end and trigger panic in the Bayern box. But Neymar can’t profit and Bayern survive!89 min: Choupo-Moting’s scuffed shot from the edge of the area runs through to Mbappé, who has a free shot at goal from 10 yards. Neuer rushes out and makes a fabulous save with his feet! As it transpires, it wouldn’t have mattered because Mbappé was offside but it’s worth stressing how good Neuer has been today, all the same.88 min: Mbappé looks disconsolate after a teammate fails to pick him out when a counter-attack looked on. PSG are looking like a beaten team. Has no one told them about the 1999 final? 86 min: Bayern sub: Tolisso on, Thiago off. Just before that, Kurzawa got booked for wiping out Kimmich.85 min: Bayern had fewer days off than PSG coming into this game but there’s no sign of the tiring. They continue to hunt down the ball whenever PSG try to piece together a move. 84 min: Coutinho curls the freekick over the wall and a couple of yards wide.83 min: No argument about that freekick: Silva is booked for tripping Lewandowski after the striker skipped past him. Bayern have a freekick about 28.1 yards out, quite central.82 min: PSG are getting increasingly vexed. Bayern are going down at every opportunity and the ref isn’t slow to whistle. 81 min: Neymar, frustrated, chops down Lewandowski on half-way. The Bayern bench jump up as if they’ve witnessed a heinous crime. Yellow card.79 min: PSG subs: Choupo-Moting and Kurzawa on, Di Maria and Bernat off. 78 min: Bayern’s subs have not made them stronger. In fact, PSG, especially Kehrer, are probably grateful they took off Coman. 77 min: Neymar feeds Verratti. Verratti tries to pick out a pass to Mbappé near the penalty spot. But he overhits it, allowing Davies to nod the ball back to Neuer.74 min: A reply shows that Kimmich did not poke the ball off Mbappé’s foot a moment ago: he poked Mbappé’s foot. The could have been a penalty. No one appealed and VAR didn’t even bother having a look.73 min: Sumptuous pass by Neymar or Mbappee to chase. He gets to it and then twists his way into the area. But Kimmich, straining heroically, pokes the ball off his feet.72 min: Neymar’s corner sparks chaos in the Bayern box. Süle clears and then cops a kick from Marquinhos. Free out.70 min: Davies fails to cut out a pass to Di Maria, who takes his time to choose the right option and then slides a lovely pass through to Marquinhos. The defender runs on to it at the near post and takes a big swinging shot, without getting the contact he wanted. Neuer is able to scramble it behind with his feet. 69 min: Bayern subs: Coutinho and Perisic on, Gnabry and Coman off. Gnabry had a quiet game compared to recent outings but Coman was brilliant.68 min: There’s a swagger to Bayern’s play now. They’ve found their groove and PSG are starting to flag, with their fullbacks looking particularly dishevelled.66 min: Alaba thunders a shot way over from 25 yards.65 min: PSG sub: Verratti on, Paredes on. Can the Italian bring the stimulus PSG need? “There’s a tattoo parlour in Wellington, NZ, whose shopfront proudly displays the word ‘TATOO’,” reports Martin Burley. “That does not exactly instil would-be customers with confidence...”63 min: Just like Kimmich for the goal, Müller floats over a cross from the right. Kehrer is caught unawares again, and Coman tries to punish him again, this time meting the delivery with his in-step. But Kimpembe clears near his own line!60 min: So PSG, so dominant in their own league, are now trailing because of a goal by a Frenchman. There’s a little irony in that. Meanwhile, Kimpembe has just made a superb ing header to prevent Bayern from doubling their lead!Coman always looked the most likely to make the break through for Bayern, but not like that! Joshua served up a dainty cross from the right to the edge of the six-yard box. Coman, barely needing to jump, kept his eye on it and guided a downward header into the the far corner! 59 min: PSG are defending deep now and with great discipline. Bayern look short of ideas, while PSG are just waiting for an opportunity to counter...57 min: You know what this game needs? Or rather, who this game needs? Verratti. There’s been a dearth of midfield ingenuity and he has plenty, if he’s fit enough. And just as I type that, Bayern send Coutinho to warm up.... 56 min: Süle booked for clumping into Di Maria late from behind.55 min: PSG maintain such a shape that Bayern are forced to start passing backwards.53 min: Goretzka’s shot from 25 takes a big deflection and loops into Navas’ arms.51 min: Aggro! Gnabry is booked for a clipping Neymar late near the touchline. The Brazilian screams in pain and several players come together to exchange angry shoves and angry shapes. Paredes gets himself a booking for excessive posturing. “That half-time comment from Gary Naylor...” begins Bobby Moore. “... is the closest Everton will ever get to a Champions League final.”48 min: Coman stabs a ball from the corner of the box towards the near post. Silva puts it out for a corner. Bayern waste it.47 min: PSG use their first possession of the half to work the ball wide to Mbappé. Müller gets back to help out Kimmich. They ignore the lollipops proffered by the forward and step in to take away his ball.46 min: Bayern get the second half going. Neither manager mad any personnel changes during the break.“Both sides remind me of Everton this season - and that’s not a good thing,” drals Gary Naylor. “There’s goals in them, but such is the paucity of imagination with the final ball that it might never happen.” “I’m no fan of Neymar, but credit where it was due: with so much of PSG’s press coming from the front, he is tasked with an absurd amount of ground to cover,” analysis Matthew Richman. “A few minutes ago he was chasing the ball with no support as three Bayern players passed it around rondo style. At no point did he drop his pace. The immediate comparison I thought of was Cristiano Ronaldo, who I remember turning to berate his teammates as Barcelona tiki-takaed around him. That is an excellent work ethic.” He has been wonderful in this tournament since it resumed. All that has been missing from him has been a goal. No better time to put that right ... It’s been a tad bitty and nervy but there have been quite a few chances nonetheless: Mbappé should have scored just before the break Neymar could have done so earlier on Lewandowski hit the post and Coman seems to be explaining to the ref as they leave the pitch why he thought he should have had a penalty. 45+1 min: Coman drives past Kehrer and into the box ... and then falls as the defender leans a little into him. Penalty? The ref thinks about for a moment and then rules that there was no foul!45 min: What a chance! A blunder at the back by Bayern gifts the ball to Mbappé, who exchanges quick passes with Di Maria and then finds himself with the ball at his feet eight yards from goal. And he shoots a gentle shot straight at the Neuer! 45 min: Kimpembe is caught trying to play out of his box, but gets away with it when Muller gives away a senseless. “You didn’t really invite MBMers to submit ideas about job-related tattoos, did you?” stammers Mike Wilner. “You must have a lot of trust in  readers. Either that or there won’t be many submissions from physicians, sewerage workers, etc.” Come on, Mike, are you really telling me you haven’t noticed that we operate strict quality control filters here? Oh.43 min: Lovely work by Neymar and Di Maria as PSG threaten for the first time in a while. But Süle breaks it up and suddenly Bayern are attacking at the other end, until Marquinhos disrupts their groove.42 min: A gorgeous cross from the left by Davies. Bernat leaps high to stop Lewandowski from getting a clean header on it.40 min: Kimmich’s corner headed clear by Kimpembe. See how many times you can say that very fast. “My trade-inspired body art would be a tattoo of a spread sheet on my forehead,” blurts Utkarsh Sharma, a trend setter if ever there was one. 37 min: Marquinhos escapes a yellow card despite hauling down Lewandowski after over-running the ball. Can Bayern punish him from the freekick instead? IT’s too far for a shot but a good chance to drop the ball around the penalty area. No! Because Marquinhos redeems himself by heading it away.35 min: More nifty work by Coman. This time his inviting cross is allowed to run all the way through to Navas, who claims it. Then exhales. Meanwhile, the camera has just panned to one of the Bayern subs (didn’t notice which one), who has a tattoo of a football on his leg. That’s the equivalent of me having a tattoo of a laptop on my ... lap. How about you, what would your trade-inspired body art be?33 min: Coman is a growing threat. He nutmegs Kehrer and pings in a wicked cross that Silva does well to head away.31 min: A cool challenge in the box by Kehrer, who kept his eye on the ball as Coman tried to dance past him. But Bayern recycle possession and work it out to the right, from where a dangerous cross come in from Kimmich. It takes a nick off Kimpembe but Lewandowsk adjusts quickly, arcing back to direct a header on target rom six yards. Navas reacts just as sharply to bat it away! 29 min: Neymar’s freekick is headed out of the box. Herrera’s lashes it back towards goal but it deflects wide. 28 min: Davies booked for pulling down Kehrer near the touchline after misjudging a bounce. PSG have a frekick in a promising crossing position... 25 min: Bayern substitution: Süle on, Boateng off. The change is enforced by an injury to Boateng, who seems to have suffered a recurrence of a knee problem.24 min: Neymar leads a vicious counter-attack, combing with Mbappé before raiding through the middle and feeding Herrera, who plays a canny little pass through to Di Maria. The Argentine’s shot flies over the bar from 16 yards.22 min: Davies races down the left and delivers and clever low cross. It’s slightly behind Lewandowski, who takes it and then swivels and gets off a bobby shot that beat Navas ... and bounces out off the post! 22 min: After Bayern dominated the first 10 minutes, PSG have come back strong and looked the more menacing. Mbappé is a particular problem for Bayern."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03ebeee679719879196c4ab0ef1f89214014b199/0_67_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=78334c7682d9bc7bbe30ed76294edea2","title":"living in the uk are you planning to move out of a city or urban area","story":"We would like to hear from people who are moving to smaller towns or more rural areas and what their reasons areAre you planning on moving out of a city?Some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid an increase in home working and a desire for more outside space.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving out of a city centre to a more suburban or rural area, we would like to hear from you.

But do your homeworkIt is the thing of fantasy for millions of people working from home – swap the bare spare-room floorboards for a sandy beachside cafe, the lukewarm tea for a cold beer and the capricious weather for constant sunshine.The fantasy is not so distant. The government of Barbados, which has seen its tourism industry heavily hit by the pandemic, is appealing for people who can work off their laptop to move to the island on a one-year visa.The Caribbean island has become the latest country to try to attract some of the growing numbers of “digital nomads” who need nothing more than a laptop and a wifi connection to earn a living, no matter where they are in the world.But how easy is it to go from one virtual desk in your home country to another across the globe?There has been a sharp increase in the number of people who no longer work from a set office – be they writers, marketeers, HR professionals, software programmers – and who can do their job by opening a laptop in any location. These online workers can be seen in coffee shops and short-term workspaces around the world, and rely on digital tools to be able to travel as they please.Putting an exact figure on the number is difficult, though a 2018 study by research firm MBO Partners found that 4.8 million US citizens identified as “digital nomads”.Georgia is also trying to attract digital workers with a visa for them to live and work as long as they are staying for six months or longer.While it may appear to be as simple a process as gathering up a few possessions and hopping on a flight, the reality of shifting your work to a new country can be a lot more complex, and the costs can mount up.“There are obvious costs such as airfares and accommodation, but also other things that people sometimes forget in the early stages of planning such as an increased cost of living, hotel costs while searching for longer-term accommodation, comprehensive health insurance, local residential taxes and rates, expatriate tax advice, paying for non-UK lawyers to review tenancy agreements and banking charges, to name but a few,” said Lee Mcintyre-Hamilton, a specialist in global mobility tax matters at accountants Blick Rothenburg. “People should also include an ‘emergencies budget’ to cover, for example, the cost of having to return to the UK early and at short notice.”Luckily there is an extensive community of digital nomads to tap for experience on how much different cities cost to live in. The website Nomadlist ranks cities via an extensive list of demands that digital workers typically have – from the overall monthly cost to the standard of free wifi, how friendly it is to women and what the air quality is like. But once you decide where to live, the next key question is where you pay tax.Whether or not you pay tax in the UK depends on whether you are a UK tax resident or not. HRMC says that if you are in the UK for 183 days or more in a tax year, you are resident. Mcintyre-Hamilton says that prospective digital nomads should work through the UK statutory residence test (SRT) to see when they will become non-resident when they go to work overseas. “It is not always straightforward to determine your UK residence status, so you may want to take some advice at this stage, since there could be a significant financial impact if you get your residence status wrong,” he says.However, non-UK residents must still pay UK tax on income sourced in the UK such as bank interest, rental income on a property or for income earned from working in the UK for a UK employer. People sometimes think that because they do not have to pay UK income tax, they are exempt from national insurance contributions – which is not always the case.“The rules for NICs are completely separate to the tax rules for people working overseas. So, for example, if an inidual works in Australia for 18 months and becomes a non-UK resident, they should not be subject to UK tax in respect of their work in Australia. However, if they work for a UK employer, then UK NICs will continue to be required for the first 52 weeks of work outside the UK. The employer will be obliged to continue to deduct NICs for this period,” says Mcintyre-Hamilton. Although the tax position is similar for employed and self-employed people, there are subtle differences which should be examined.Failing to prepare can result in unforeseen and unwanted tax bills in the future. One major pitfall can be when someone thinks they are a non-UK resident, but misunderstands the rules and remains resident. Other problems can arise when people fall foul of the rules, such as the case of a London-based employee who worked from his girlfriend’s house in Dublin but did not tell his employer, or the Irish tax authorities. After a few years, it emerged the man had been tax resident in Ireland, resulting in a tax bill, a long process to unravel the complicated affairs and a large historic social security bill.Mcintyre-Hamilton cites another case where a UK toy company allowed an employee to work from France for most of the year. However his presence triggered complex corporate tax rules and the company and the French authorities were able to impose corporate tax on the estimated profits he was making from his base in France."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6614e8f8bd58d286f979e49c73319cc271addb42/0_196_3744_2247/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f52dc4b28865cb51ea8c82e3b72397a","title":"bbc considers dropping rule britannia from last night of the proms","story":"Covid restrictions seen as opportunity for change in wake of Black Lives Matter protestsThe traditional flag-waving anthems Rule Britannia and Land of Hope of Glory could be dropped from the Last Night of the Proms because of their perceived links with colonialism and slavery.The BBC is reportedly considering whether to axe the patriotic staples in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests, and the Covid restrictions are seen as an opportunity to make the change.Reduced orchestra sizes, social distancing and no audiences make the 2020 Proms a very different experience from past years.The final concert will be conducted by Dalia Stasevska, 35, from Finland, only the second female conductor to preside over the Last Night of the Proms.“Dalia is a big supporter of Black Lives Matter and thinks a ceremony without an audience is the perfect moment to bring change,” a BBC source told the Sunday Times.In 2001, four days after the 911 attacks, the BBC replaced the songs with more “reflective music” during the Last Night of the Proms, but it returned to the traditional formula in following years.Chi-chi Nwanoku, the founder of Chineke!, an orchestra whose musicians are majority black, Asian and ethnically erse, said she could not understand why the BBC had thought it was a good idea to reinstate songs that many found offensive.She recently emailed BBC Proms chiefs urging them to drop Rule Britannia. “The lyrics are just so offensive, talking about the ‘haughty tyrants’ – people that we are invading on their land and calling them haughty tyrants – and Britons shall never be slaves, which implies that it’s OK for others to be slaves but not us,” Nwanoku told the . “It’s so irrelevant to today’s society. It’s been irrelevant for generations, and we seem to keep perpetuating it.”Nwanoku, a principal bass player in London orchestras for 35 years, founded Chineke! in 2015 to provide career opportunities to established and up-and-coming black, Asian and ethnically erse classical musicians in the UK and Europe. The orchestra made its highly acclaimed Proms debut in 2017.She said if the BBC did not axe Rule Britannia, she would be mortified. “I will feel invisible with my people and our history. If the BBC are talking about Black Lives Matter and their support for the movement, how could you possibly have Rule Britannia as the last concert – in any concert?”Plans are yet to be finalised for the concert on 12 September. The BBC said in a statement: “We are still finalising arrangements for the Last Night of the Proms so that we are able to respond to the latest advice in regards to Covid-19 and deliver the best offering possible for audiences.“We have announced that conductor Dalia Stasevska, soprano Golda Schultz and the BBC Symphony Orchestra will perform at the Last Night of the Proms this year.”Rule Britannia and Land of Hope of Glory were among the “crudely jingoistic texts” singled out for criticism by the classical music critic Richard Morrison in a column for BBC Music Magazine last month. He wrote that given the restrictions necessitated by the pandemic, “there will never be a better moment to drop that toe-curling, embarrassing, anachronistic farrago of nationalistic songs that concludes the Last Night of the Proms.”He added: “In the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests and the toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, it would surely be insensitive, bordering on the incendiary, to roar out these hypocritical 18th-century words, with or without irony.”Morrison’s column led to a backlash, with the Conservative MP Philip Davies dismissing it as “extremist, virtue-signalling views”. News that the future of the anthems was now under debate was criticised as unpatriotic by several prominent pro-Brexit campaigners, including Nigel Farage.The Proms presenter Josie d’Arby told the Times: “This year everyone is thinking about racial equality. The Proms has always done that but … it is upping it out of respect for the current climate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e901be841c4d95df745c4bb1c5705f9e99ea95b2/0_0_8192_5464/master/8192.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29f395fdfc2f2e371b97a33ed0a4d4dc 1010w","title":"the future is fungal why the megascience of mycology is on the rise","story":"The study of fungi has long been overshadowed by more glamorous scientific quests. But biologist Merlin Sheldrake is on a mission to change thatAs a boy, Merlin Sheldrake really loved the autumn. In the garden of his parents’ house – he grew up a few moments from Hampstead Heath, which is where he and I are walking right now, on an overcast summer morning – the leaves would fall from a big chestnut tree, forming gentle drifts into which he liked nothing more than to hurl himself. Wriggling around until he was fully submerged, Sheldrake would lie there, quite content, “buried in the rustle, lost in curious smells”. As he writes in his wondrous new book, Entangled Life, these autumnal piles were both places to hide and worlds to explore.But as the months passed, they shrank: reaching into them, trying to find out why, he would pull out matter that looked more like soil than leaves. What was going on? Turning to his father for an answer (he is the son of Rupert Sheldrake, the controversial science writer best known for proposing the concept of “morphic resonance”) was how he first came to learn about decomposition, and thus it is to these rotting leaves that we may trace his original interest in the “neglected megascience” of mycology – the study of fungi – even if neglect is a relative term. “In east Asia, fungi have been loved and revered for thousands of years,” he says. “In China, there are temples to the man who worked out how to cultivate shiitake mushrooms. But yes, in the west it has been neglected.”There are, he thinks, two reasons for this. The first is straightforward: only recently have technologies been available that allow scientists fully to investigate the fungal world to open up the hidden realms that lie beneath us, invisible to the eye. The second is historical. “There is an entrenched disciplinary bias,” he says. “Fungi weren’t seen as their own kingdom of life until the 60s. Mycologists were put in a corner of the plant sciences department, rather than in their own fungal sciences department. This had a huge impact – if you’re not training researchers, it will be neglected.” Outside science, many people, if not most, associate fungi only with mushrooms. “And they are ephemeral,” he says. “It’s as if we could only see the flowers and fruit of a tree, and not the rest of it: its leaves, stems and roots.” He shakes his curls. “Fungal taxonomy has been a total mess for ages. Linnaeus described it as chaos, a scandal of art. Through the middle ages and into the 18th century, people had no grasp at all of it. They thought mushrooms came up where lightning struck – that you could tell which one was going to kill you by boiling it with a wooden spoon.”Even now, the non-mycologist often experiences a strange ambivalence when it comes to fungi, one that can encompass both disgust and fear, and a powerful attraction there’s a reason why Raymond Briggs called his smelliest character Fungus the Bogeyman. In Entangled Life, Sheldrake describes the horror stirred in Gwen Raverat’s Aunt Etty by the pungent and suggestively shaped stinkhorn mushroom, Phallus impudicus (Raverat, the engraver and memoirist, was the granddaughter of Charles Darwin). Etty would, Raverat recalled in 1952, “sniff her way” through her local wood, armed with a special stick with which she used to poke the stinkhorns into her basket. She would then take them home and burn them “in deepest secrecy on the drawing room fire with the door locked – because of the morals of the maids”. As Sheldrake notes, her exploits would have spread the stinkhorns’ spores far more effectively than any number of the flies that, attracted by their stench, usually do this work.But Entangled Life, which arrives garlanded with praise from nature writers Robert Macfarlane and Helen Macdonald, is an astonishing book that could alter our perceptions of fungi for ever.It seems somehow to tip the natural world upside down. The science it relates is complex. For his work on underground fungal networks in Panamanian forests, Sheldrake received a PhD in tropical ecology from Cambridge University. His principal interest is in mycorrhizal fungi, which are the kind that live in symbiosis with plants. Such fungi send out gossamer-fine tubes called hyphae, which weave into the tips of plant roots at cellular level in this way, inidual plants are joined to one another by an underground network – a vast, highly intricate, collaborative structure that has been dubbed the Wood Wide Web. But he also has a gift for making difficult ideas easily comprehensible. His enthusiasm for mycology is not only passionate it’s grounded in his conviction that, in the future, fungi will play an ever more crucial role in our understanding of the environment, in a range of new technologies from building materials to sustainable food, packaging products to alternative “leather”, and in our relationship with waste.Hyphae make mycelium, the mass of branching that comprises the vegetative part of a fungus. But they also make more specialised structures, such as mushrooms – organs that can perform astonishing feats. When some explosively discharge their spores, they accelerate 10,000 times faster than a space shuttle after launch. Others can push their way through asphalt and lift paving stones. One study estimated that if a single hypha was as wide as a human hand, it would be able to lift an 8 tonne bus. If you teased apart the mycelium found in a gram of soil and laid it end to end, it could stretch anywhere from 100 metres to 10 kilometres.For some time now, Sheldrake and I have been sitting on a bench, close to some trees – a spot that, as dog walkers pass by, invites the question of how the public should best behave towards the fungal realm. “We need to stop spraying fungicide,” he says. “A few strokes of a pen could make that illegal. But for our own part? Well, there are citizen scientists who report on the presence of mushrooms at certain times of year, and show how they’re responding to climate change. That’s a good thing to do. Fungal conservation is in its infancy. In 2018, just 56 species were on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list, compared to tens of thousands of plants and animals. Beyond that, if you’re picking mushrooms, don’t take them all: leave some behind, and try not to damage the networks by digging around in the ground.”There are plenty of ways we might connect with fungi, not least by eating them. As he worked on Entangled Life, Sheldrake ate mushrooms every day: “It was a way of reminding myself that I was talking about living things that I’m part of the metabolic cycles I was writing about.” Once he was in possession of a physical copy of the book, he then grew some mushrooms on it. “They were delicious,” he wrote, when he posted a film of himself cooking them on his Twitter account. “I couldn’t taste any off-notes, which suggests that the fungus has fully metabolised the text.” He particularly likes lion’s mane mushrooms, which taste a little like lobster or crab. He and his brother, Cosmo, are also into fermentation, and have a small lab in their parents’ garden, where they make sauerkraut, kimchee, pickles and beetroot kvass (an eastern European drink usually made from fermented rye bread). “It’s very life-giving,” he says.Sheldrake isn’t currently affiliated with any institution. “I’ve got lots of scientific papers to publish,” he says, before we begin walking to the station. “And there are so many experiments to be done. I need some funding. But I’m reluctant to re-enter the academic world, that constant round of applying for grants.” Might he start his own company? “Yes, there’s that, too.” In his book, he writes almost as admiringly of Paul Stamets, a man who may have done more than anyone else to popularise fungal topics outside university departments (Stamets runs a multimillion-dollar fungal business, Fungi Perfecti his TED talk, “Six Ways That Mushrooms Can Save the World”, has been watched millions of times), as he does of Sir David Read, an emeritus professor of plant science at Sheffield University, and the man who, in the 1980s, was the first scientist to show conclusively that carbon could pass between green plants through fungal connections. It seems wholly possible that Sheldrake may indeed remain outside academia that part of his mission in the future may have to do as much with the communication of science as with science itself.Explaining mycology to the lay person isn’t easy. While everyone knows what a bird is, or a tree, the language of the microbial realm is unfamiliar, and its elements largely invisible to the naked eye. But he seems, if not exactly to relish this challenge (he’s not about, I think, to become the new David Bellamy), then to understand the importance of rising to it. Either way, the shores of this far corner of biology seem to suit him. “At university, plant sciences were slightly marginalised,” he says, softly. “But that also meant that you had more space, and I always liked that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dee61d8f80038244351cd092fe78e04e7d463272/88_100_2902_1742/master/2902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d5c677840ef3fa1fde5e631a3a58e6e","title":"sophia popov holds her nerve and lands first major with the womens open","story":"For Sophia Popov a little piece of history alongside a $675,000 (£515,000) cheque. Victory in the Women’s Open – ultimately so comfortable the scale of her underdog status was easily forgotten – means the 27-year-old becomes the first German to claim a major title on British soil.In the first staging of this championship on the famed Ayrshire links, Popov joins a stellar list – Arnold Palmer, Tom Watson et al – of iconic Troon major winners. Popov was in floods of tears even before tapping in for victory on the 72nd green.That scene only emphasised earlier battles and a life-changing performance. Moments later she walked towards the clubhouse with champagne bottle in hand even golf’s blazer brigade had to nod in approval.This seemed the most unlikely of outcomes. Popov was chasing success in 54-hole competitions on the Cactus Tour in the middle of this year. The very name seems to perfectly articulate that level. She began this week as the world No 304 and without any apparent major credentials whatsoever. She did not even have status on the LPGA Tour. Now, Popov can pick and choose where to play.She started day four holding a three-stroke lead, a supposedly dicey situation for a player unaccustomed to challenging for titles. Popov’s position never looked under serious threat. Her closing 68 meant a two-stroke success, at seven under par overall. Jasmine Suwannapura, the Thai player who like Tiger Woods has rebounded from career-saving back surgery, finished second.“This feels amazing,” said Popov. “There has been a lot of work, there have been a lot of struggles. I knew I was capable, I just had a lot of obstacles in my way. The Women’s Open to me was a bonus. I got here on Tuesday, I knew my game was in good shape and anything was possible. I just took that belief into every round but I never expected this.”If Popov was, quite understandably, never counting on victory, one hole emphasised what was meant to be. Her drive at the 15th appeared destined for one of the treacherous fairway bunkers, with the ball instead scuttling into adjacent rough. Her subsequent iron shot, from an uphill lie, finished 20ft from the hole. With the birdie putt duly converted, she led by four.Only Suwannapura belatedly threatened to spoil the party, thanks to a superb birdie from 40ft on the 16th. Popov responded with another one of her own at the same hole. Suwannapura swung again, collecting another shot at the par-three 17th. Yet the leader knew only a disastrous finish would cost her the first women’s major of 2020. There was no such implosion, nor any suggestion of one. Minjee Lee finished third, at three under.The Sunday scene was perfect. Gone were the gusts that affected the first two rounds, with the coast as close as seemed possible to flat calm.Popov is due immense credit for this nerveless win but one wonders how the elements may have disrupted the mindset of one so unaccustomed to jousting for the top titles. She made bogey from sand at the first but bounced back with three birdies in her next five holes.“I used to be a player who didn’t like to lead so this was a new position,” she said. “I just had belief going into this round. I told myself I was capable of birdies on every hole.”Lydia Ko stood with arms aloft on the 18th green after converting a lengthy putt for par. The celebrations embodied her final day. At three over, the re-emerging New Zealander finished with a share of 14th. Better – much better – is surely to come from the two-times major winner. It would be wise to keep an eye on her during the remainder of this year.So too Inbee Park, whose 66 meant fourth place. “It’s my husband’s first week at a major championship,” she said. “Posting a top-10 finish for him is a really nice thing to do.” Park, Lee, Suwannapura and Popov were the only players to break par.This was a highly successful event and justified the persistence of the R\u0026ampA in staging it. Pace of play, the scourge of golf in recent times, was not an issue at all.Troon responded magnificently at a juncture where a major for the female game had never carried such value. The highest prize of all belongs to Popov. Cactus Tour no more. Eat your heart out, Bernhard Langer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdd1e124062897ec0559bcb6752618ce5116e0ec/3_0_5901_3543/master/5901.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f62268270b156b9cd9f495af34d13eba","title":"italians do it better an expert guide to hosting an amalfi inspired dinner party","story":"Giulia Rhodes speaks to some in-the-know Italians about how stunning seafood and verdant produce can add a touch of the Amalfi coast to your next dinner partyFrom authors and actors to designers and directors, the glamorous set has long flocked to Italy’s Amalfi coast.

It is the highlight of our day. Food is not just seen as a necessity.”He celebrates the regional roots of Italian cuisine, sharing culture and stories to support local speciality pasta dishes. The food of the southern Italian Amalfi coast is different to that of his native Genoa, in the north, but it is close to his heart.“We go every year. My wife is from Naples and we married in Capri. I love it. The people are friendly, funny and loud, and the cuisine has everything – from amazing fish and seafood, fruits and vegetables to wonderful pizza and pasta. I discovered dishes that only really exist in that area.”His personal favourite is spaghetti alla nerano, with fried courgette and provolone cheese. While scialatielli – somewhere between linguine and tagliatelle in shape – with Amalfi lemon, ‘nduja sausage and mascarpone, features on the Pasta Evangelists’ Amalfi week menu.“Pasta dishes are about simplicity, freshness and few ingredients. We can bring that to your home,” he says. Although he admits he can’t deliver the full experience. “In Italy, we do tend to take the sunshine for granted.”Carla Bollati, a retired doctor from Turin, was introduced to the area around Amalfi by her late partner Gennaro, a Neapolitan. “I have a deep sentimental attachment,” she says. “And the tastes are a lovely way to travel to happy memories.”She was struck by the area’s scenery from her first visit. “It is a crowded landscape that cannot be changed. But there is also such special light and colour, the perfume of lemons, so many wonderful flavours. All the senses are covered.”The people and cuisine of the south are, she says, another huge draw. “They cook with what the area has to offer. Try a mozzarella there and you will understand what it is supposed to be.”Culinary roots and rules are revered, she adds. “If I cooked Neapolitan pasta e fagioli – with beans – for Gennaro, it had to be with broken odds and ends of pasta. Shells just wouldn’t be right. We Italians are so tied to the history of our food and the habit of coming together to eat it.”Italian food expert and cook, Paola Maggiulli, who runs the Tiny Italian supper clubs and cookery courses, agrees. But she insists it is a very inclusive tradition. To create an authentic Italian dinner, she says, the starting point is confidence.“Anyone can make Italian food. It is about flavour, not technique. With a few quality ingredients you can make incredible dishes.”Having spent much of her childhood in her father’s south London Italian deli, she recommends taking time to shop for good ingredients and learn the stories behind them.“In normal times, what is special about Italian food is the connection and time with other people. That might be planning the menu with friends or helping your grandmother prepare Sunday lunch for the extended family. Community and family are everything. Sharing the experience of eating with people you care about just makes you feel better.”So what would Maggiulli serve for a feelgood dinner inspired by the Amalfi coast?“I would want those incredible lemons,” she says, suggesting simple spaghetti with lemon, parmesan, olive oil and basil as a first course.“Amalfi seafood is beautiful, too. So perhaps a main of braised octopus, mussels cooked in white wine, or a frittura mista platter of fried squid and prawns,” she says. A chocolate and almond cake – a torta caprese after the island of Capri – would end the meal nicely.When you host your party, build the convivial atmosphere by serving the food on large dishes in the middle of the table, for guests to help themselves, and make sure the conversation, as well as the drinks, are flowing.For the latter, Daniele Umoette, former bar manager and drinks brand ambassador from Carpi in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna, suggests a gin spritz aperitif to kickstart the evening.“Mix blood orange flavoured Malfy Gin Con Arancia with Fever Tree Sicilian Lemon Tonic and a splash of prosecco over lots of ice in a nice glass, and garnish with some fruit such as blackberries, pink grapefruit slice and some aromatic herbs such as sage,” he says.Admittedly, your after-dinner stroll will probably be a little less glamorous than the nightly passeggiata in Positano. Maybe next year. Meanwhile, buon appetito.Malfy Gin is available to purchase in selected Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Asda, M\u0026ampS, Waitrose and Co-op stores, as well as Ocado and the Malfy Gin Amazon brand storePlease drink Malfy Gin responsibly.

In the early days it formed the basis of many a #quarantini – made from whatever we might have left in the cupboard. Since then, the hashtag has clocked up more than 87,000 posts and the term has passed into the popular lexicon. Now, take it a notch higher for the ultimate cocktail moment. With Malfy Gin, you can create the most authentic Italian style aperitivo hour. Try a Malfy Gin Rosa G\u0026ampT by mixing a measure of Malfy Gin Rosa with Mediterranean tonic in a copa glass over ice and garnishing with a pink grapefruit wheel. Or, for an added touch of sophistication, mix a measure of Malfy Gin Rosa with 50ml prosecco and 50ml San Pellegrino Arraciata Rossa over ice in a wine glass, and garnish with an orange wheel, strawberry slice and sprig of thyme to create a Amalfi Sunset Spritz.Front-room festivalsIf you missed glamping it up at Glasto or living it up at Latitude this summer, there’s nothing to stop you recreating that festival feeling right in your front room. This year, with staycations booming, boutique bell tents are all the rage, and whether you’re a Hyde Park regular, or head to the Isle of Wight every summer, you don’t have to miss out. Pitch your tent in the garden – or indoors if it’s raining – swing open the patio doors, pour yourself a Malfy Gin and tonic, and cue up your festival playlist. Designer wellies optional.UpcyclingNesting has taken on new meaning as we’re spending more time than ever at home, meaning that we are looking to make our personal spaces as cosy and reassuring as possible. With major home improvement projects put on hold, we’re looking at subtler ways to spruce up our living spaces, often going hand-in-hand with the crafts we’ve taken up to help while away our extended free time. Repurposing old units and reupholstering much-loved chairs are at the top of many DIY lists – and when it comes to themes and patterns, rainbows and bright, uplifting shades are the order of the day.Micro garden partiesWith our close friends and family having been out of bounds for so long, we’re getting to know the neighbours. WhatsApp groups for inidual streets and blocks of flats are springing up across the country as we look closer to home for friendship, support and entertainment.Scaled-down garden parties comprising small groups of neighbours dressing up and bringing over their own food and drinks – nibbled and sipped at a respectful distance – make for eclectic gatherings and unexpected new friendships being forged.Staying ‘in-in’Now we can no longer go “out-out” – and with loungewear fatigue firmly setting in – summer is about dressing up for virtual socialising. Many of us are seeing more of our friends than ever as we plan regular catch-ups via online video calling, from family quizzes to propping up a virtual bar with friends, while Royal Ascot 2020 saw thousands of us donning fascinators in front of the TV in aid of frontline charities. So as the weather warms up, it’s time to cast off your lockdown look and raise a glass of Malfy Gin in style.Locally sourced picnicsWith public transport still only used for essential travel and some of our favourite parks and gardens closed, we’re exploring the green spaces closer to home for a suitable patch of grass on which to spread our blankets.The best-dressed picnic baskets are filled with treats that support local producers, from honey collected by local beekeepers and veg from the farmer’s market, to unique small-batch cheeses and British charcuterie sliced on to artisanal sourdough. Explore your local high street to see what gems you can unearth.Home cooking with a little helpOnce we realised how much mess keeping a sourdough starter alive entails, the appeal of devoting ourselves to becoming expert home chefs faded fairly fast. With more food businesses pivoting to offer meal kits designed to be finished off at home for that personal touch, there’s no better time to start enjoying gourmet food delivered to your door (without worrying about it getting cold). For a taste of Italy, Pasta Evangelists offer artisan pasta and sauces via next-day delivery across the UK, which can be whipped up at home in minutes. With dishes inspired by culinary traditions found across Italy, from Venice to Sicily, you can be taken on a foodie journey with all the taste and minimum effort.Growing lupinsSince lockdown began, gardening has shot up in popularity, with garden centres opening some time before other non-essential businesses. From window sills to flower beds, this summer is about attempting to turn green spaces into a riot of colour to rival the rainbows pinned in people’s windows, and the West Country Lupin has been particularly popular. Packed with uplifting colour, lupins are easy to grow and soothing to look at, making them the ideal flower to plant this summer.Virtual destination toursGrounded globetrotters are fulfilling their wanderlust by taking virtual tours of some of the world’s most stunning spots. Choose from tours offering 360-degree views of popular destinations such as Tokyo or Machu Picchu, or watch a live stream from San Diego Zoo or California’s Monterey Bay Aquarium.You can even take a treadmill walk through the Colosseum – made even more authentic by concocting a refreshing gin spritz with Malfy Gin Rosa to take with you on your virtual tour.CottagecoreAnyone not ensconced in a countryside pad with an acre or two of garden attached is currently looking enviously towards the idyllic-looking lockdowns of those who are. As even the most ardent city-dweller wrests with sourdough starters and homemade crumpets, we’re being calmed by a trend that has been dubbed “cottagecore” – an aesthetic oozing with images of perfect-looking pies, vases filled with wildflowers and verdant countryside. Get the look by adding some floral frocks or shirts to your wardrobe.Malfy Gin is available to purchase in selected Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Asda, M\u0026ampS, Waitrose and Co-op stores, as well as Ocado and the Malfy Gin Amazon brand storePlease drink Malfy Gin responsibly.

Just Ignore Him begins with you looking at them, after driving away from your childhood home. Why start there?Because that’s when the sky fell in a bit. I also thought, ah, I now have an angle to my book – I can take a course of action in the present day on behalf of the boy that I was.How was that as a process?Full of fear. I had lots of conversations with friends, trusted readers, lots of one-on-ones in restaurants in London, and many said: “Look, are you sure you want to do this? Are you sure you want to go public?” But I knew I wanted to tell the world about my story, and my mother’s story. I also wanted to tell people they could talk about their own stories, even if they had never talked about them before. I’ve become a huge enemy of silence and secrecy. I regard them as the twin evils.You also reveal that your mother wasn’t told she was terminally ill when she was dying in hospital. This was your father’s wish. Is it fair to say that this is a book about what men have been allowed to get away with within their families, and within society?Yes. My book is very much about that. It’s relevant that I’m a father now, too. Seeing my sons pass through the ages that I was when my mother died, when my father did what he did… it’s mind-boggling, terrifying. I also learned through writing my book about how men deploy that power. It’s not always about literal strength or aggression, although that can be useful. Sometimes it’s about that person looking for pity or painting themselves as a victim. Sometimes really wicked people can present really well.Did it feel cathartic to explore that?Not at all. It felt like going into the fire. Stop running, Alan. Stop hiding. It’s time to face the fire.You also realised that parts of your comedy career were influenced by her.I hadn’t forgotten that I used to do this thing that made my mother laugh – lying on the floor, moving my legs around like windscreen wipers. But while writing the book, I realised that in all these routines in my 20s, I’d end up lying on the floor, too. I mean, it’s a very unusual thing for a standup comedian to do, to relinquish that position of power and authority. I did a lot of gigs with Jack Dee, and he never lay on the floor once. Eddie Izzard did everything else, but even he didn’t do that!How was writing a book different from writing standup?Comedy is the topsoil. This was digging into the bedrock. Sometimes comedy is moving, touching and affecting, but it’s not normally a punch in the eye.In the book you talk about reporting your father to the police in 2017, and his court case. This was as his Alzheimer’s disease was progressing. Is  he still alive?As far as I know, yes. He’s in a nursing home. My sister keeps me updated if I ask her.Your uncle also died of dementia. Did this family history of memory loss influence your need to record your experiences in detail?I think so, but this book is also for my kids. People have said: “God, you want your kids to read this?” And absolutely I do, when they’re old enough. Knowledge about your life is a gift to children. My littlest boy is always asking: “Where did you go on holiday when you were little, Daddy? What did you have for tea? Which Marvel character did you like?” And I’ll be “the Hulk and Spiderman, of course”, and he’s really pleased with that information. Thinking of that need further down the line was a motivation for me.Have your kids influenced you creatively?Not enough. They’ve made me more aware of my bad behaviour!How has the pandemic affected you?Covid has been catastrophic for me, my industry and my friends. I’m personally afraid to be in a pub, so the idea of sitting in a room with a hundred people laughing out everything from their lungs… it’s heartbreaking. A friend of mine was very seriously ill with it – he’s OK now, but I know how scary it is. More than anything, I’m furious about the government. I’m furious we locked down so late. I’m furious that they said, very proudly, that they had a rehearsal for a pandemic in 2016, which was an absolute shit-show, then they learned none of the lessons. And to tell people to go to work, without the kit they need not to die at work, then applaud them on the pavement… it’s beyond shameful. It’s enraging.Lots of male comics of your generation are writing emotional books. Why?We’re all doing this as iniduals, obviously, not all emailing each other going, you doing this? Oh, me too! But we’re all living in the same soup, and I’ve learned over the years that if you’ve had an idea to do something, then someone else definitely has, too. But I think it’s interesting that this is happening when no one is really looking for white middle-aged men.What do you mean?I mean we’ve had it all our own way for a very long time. When I auditioned to be Jonathan Creek, I was one of 38 white men. When I made the pilot for QI, I was one of five white men on the panel. I was one of five white men on lots of panels, for years. Nowadays, there is a movement to redress the balance, and publishers are looking for more women and people of colour, and in the middle of all that, here are white middle-aged men writing about their actual life, emotions and feelings. They’ve stopped trying to concoct a version of themselves to present to the world. They’ve started to tell the truth.What do you hope for for your book?Overwhelmingly positive reactions from allcomers. Favourable critical reviews. Lots of readers who enjoy the jokes, are moved at the moving bits, and aren’t unkind, as people often are. I also hope it helps people break away from family secrets. That is what I really want it to do.• Just Ignore Him is published on 1 September by Little, Brown (£18.99). To order a copy go to bookshop.

Factors such as transmission rates, the child’s ability to use the mask and adequate adult supervision should all be taken into account.Children aged five years and under should not be required to wear masks based on the safety and overall interest of the child.The WHO first advised adults to wear masks in public in June, and the government made them compulsory in shops in England from 24 July.Gavin Williamson, the UK’s education secretary, said this month that research by Public Health England indicated there was little risk of the virus being transmitted at school, but the agency subsequently stated that secondary school pupils were just as likely as adults to transmit the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8159124207ea273b0f4af58119ea65d61b215501/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b02f9ae1ee3d6ed8bdb1be4ce2a1163","title":"global report who says world could rein in pandemic in less than two years","story":"South Korea records most cases since early March South Africa infections pass 600,000 Brazil on ‘downward trend’ The world should be able to rein in the coronavirus pandemic in less than two years, the World Health Organization has said, as South Korea reported the most daily infections since early March and expanded social distancing measures across the country.The WHO’s chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, struck a partly optimistic note when he drew comparisons between the Covid-19 pandemic and the with the 1918 flu pandemic, saying technology could help end the spread.“We have a disadvantage of globalisation, closeness, connectedness, but an advantage of better technology, so we hope to finish this pandemic before less than two years,” he told reporters.By “utilising the available tools to the maximum and hoping that we can have additional tools like vaccines, I think we can finish it in a shorter time than the 1918 flu”, he said.The WHO also recommended that children over 12 use masks in the same situations as adults as the use of face coverings increases to stop the virus spread. In fresh guidelines developed in cooperation with UNICEF it said children should wear “a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a one-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area”.The advice came as South Korea reported 332 new cases on Saturday, including 315 local infections. The figure is the highest since 8 March, when it recorded 367 infections.All of the country’s 17 major cities and provinces reported cases for the first time since January, Yonhap reported. It said stricter social distancing rules would be imposed outside the greater Seoul area, from Sunday. The government had previously raised social distancing rules in Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi province to level two in the three-tier system.Karaoke bars, clubs and computer cafes were ordered to close and Sunday church services have been banned.South Africa’s Covid-19 infections passed 600,000 on Friday, although the number of new cases has been declining since a peak in July. Despite imposing one of the world’s toughest lockdowns at the end of March, when the country had only a few hundred cases, South Africa saw a surge in coronavirus infections that has left it the hardest hit on the continent.The government eased lockdown restrictions this week to allow most of the economy to re-open. But President Cyril Ramaphosa cautioned that cases could surge if people failed to maintain vigilance.Brazil reported 30,355 new cases of the coronavirus and 1,054 deaths, the health ministry said on Friday. Despite this, the WHO’s emergencies director Michael Ryan told a virtual press conference that there was a “clear downward trend in many parts of Brazil”.The country has recorded nearly 6,900 deaths and more than 290,000 cases in the last seven days, according to the UN health agency: “The acceleration of cases has stabilised but there’s still a very high number of cases and a large number of deaths,” Ryan said.“Credit to the health workers and the communities in Brazil for taking the necessary actions to stabilise the situation,” he said.“We’re in that difficult period in Brazil where it looks like things could be getting better. The question is: is this a lull, can this be continued and can we see that downward trend?”Brazil has more than 3.5m cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic began, while the official death toll is more than 113,00.In Europe Germany, France, Spain and Italy, all saw infection levels rise to rates not seen in months, sparking fears over a second wave on the continent.In Spain’s capital Madrid, officials recommended people in the most affected areas stay at home to help curb the spread as the country registered more than 8,000 new cases in 24 hours. The figure was a 1,000-case jump on the previous day.France reported 4,500 new cases on Friday, the second consecutive day of more than 4,000 new infections –numbers not seen since May – with metropolitan areas accounting for most of those infections.Germany reported 2,034 cases on Saturday, its highest daily cases since 25 April.

By Sunday India’s death toll had reached 56,706.The country’s health ministry said the key to fighting Covid-19 was shaping the country’s recovery rate, which it mapped out in a tweet. Last week India carried out a million tests on a single day for the first time.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 397 new infections Sunday, up from the previous day’s 332 and marking more than a week of daily three-digit rises.Three-quarters of the new cases were in the capital and surrounding areas, and one quarter in provincial areas. Yonhap reported that it was the first time in recent weeks that 100 cases had been reported outside the capital.The new figure, the highest since early March, coincided with new social distancing measures outside the capital, Seoul. They ban in-person church meetings and nightclubs, buffets and cyber cafes are all closed.Health authorities say they may eventually deploy the toughest stage-three social-distancing rules, where schools and business are urged to close, if the rate of increase in new infections does not slow soon.Mexico’s death toll has passed 60,000 and its infections rose past 550,000. Mexico is now the third worst country for fatalities, only behind Brazil (114,000) and the US (176,000). However Mexico is only seventh in terms of infections.Despite the figures, the government declared this week that the coronavirus scourge was in “sustained decline” in Mexico. On Saturday the country recorded 644 deaths, the second lowest figure this month.The worst-hit Latin American country, Brazil, on Saturday recorded 50,032 new cases of coronavirus. The country has so far seen more than 3.5 million cases of the virus.In the Australian state of Victoria, which has been battling a major outbreak, a further 208 new cases were reported as the national death toll passed 500.The state’s chief health officer, Dr Brett Sutton, said the trajectory of the outbreak was decreasing. “We are not going to see three-hundreds or four-hundreds again – not under my watch,” he said. Seventeen deaths were also reported, including 11 in age care facilities.Victoria is now halfway through a six-week period of hard lockdowns. The premier Daniel Andrews said if the state was to open up early, the freedom enjoyed by people would be short-lived and a third wave would be inevitable.“There’s going to be a massive job of repair but we are up to that,” Andrews said.In New Zealand, which until two weeks ago had gone 100 days without a locally transmitted case, the health ministry reported just one new infection in the community. The case was a household contact of someone already identified in the Auckland cluster.There are now 151 people linked to the city’s cluster who have been moved into managed quarantine facilities, including 82 positive cases.In other developments:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0da3d23db911ee6b02e6657ffc5ac7790e4b313/515_530_2687_1612/master/2687.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e2f8fc6c7936593ee8e1778574bb29a2","title":"reopening schools may lead to a rise in virus cases and local lockdowns","story":"Chief medical officers says risks must be balanced against harm for children by not attending schoolReopening schools could lead to coronavirus infections rising and force the reintroduction of some local lockdown measures, the UK’s most senior medical advisers have warned.In a joint statement on Saturday night, the chief and deputy chief medical officers from across the UK said while there were “no risk-free options”, further time out of the classroom would increase inequalities, reduce the life chances of children and could exacerbate physical and mental health issues.They said they were confident that there was an “exceptionally small risk of children of primary or secondary school age dying from Covid-19”. However, they added that it is “possible that opening schools will provide enough upward pressure on R that it goes above 1 having previously been below it, at least in some local areas”. They add: “This will require local action and could mean societal choices that weigh up the implications of imposing limitations on different parts of the community and the economy.”The R value reflects the average number of people a person infected with coronavirus passes the disease on to. When the figure is above 1, an outbreak can begin to grow exponentially.Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, warned that Britain faced a “real problem” with coronavirus this winter and that it would remain a “serious challenge” for at least the next nine months.Asked about the potential for the return of lockdown measures, he said: “That is certainly possible and I don’t think that’s a controversial statement, I think that’s just a statement of reality. As I have said in various other situations, we are left with a large number of situations where we have to make really quite difficult choices. There are no easy choices in confronting coronavirus.“The fact of schools being open will probably lead to some increase in transmission but much of that is indirect, it’s not so much the children passing it on but the fact that schools are open allows more mixing of adults in the workplace and in other environments.“The result of that is that it will create some upward pressure on the R, it may increase it. The evidence from other parts of the world is that when schools have opened, this has not led to a sudden surge in transmission that looks as if it’s due to the schools opening and we are very confident this effect is not anywhere near as severe as it would be, for example, with flu where children and schools are a very large part of transmission. But it is likely to put some pressure upward on R and if that happens we will have to respond.”He added: “What we are trying to do is learn the lessons from the first wave of coronavirus to minimise the chance of significant impact in the medium to long term. But I do want to be really clear, even with all the information we have got now, even with all the tools we have at our disposal now, we have still got a really serious challenge of coronavirus for at least the next nine months. Going into winter, we’re going to have real problems with this virus and the information we have got on this virus will help us but it does not take away the fact this is a very very substantial challenge we are all collectively going to have to respond to.”In their joint statement, medical officers from across the four nations said the evidence that older children and teenagers are at lower risk of catching Covid-19 “is mixed”, adding: “Very few, if any, children or teenagers will come to long term harm from Covid-19 due solely to attending school. This has to be set against a certainty of long-term harm to many children and young people from not attending school.”They said that international evidence did not suggest school reopening was followed by a surge in infections, but added that this could not be concluded with confidence.“Early identification and quickly managing outbreaks of Covid-19 in schools is essential as part of a local response to Covid-19,” they stated. “Clear advice for pupils and staff not to attend school with symptoms, and prompt availability of testing, appropriate isolation advice, and careful public health surveillance and monitoring of educational establishments are key to support the safe return to schools.”They said that changes related to the reopening of schools could be “as important as what happens within the school”. They cited parents going back to work, meeting at the school gates, public transport and shared vehicles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dc6c2c115d691ed3a0b26273dcc468e32acd6c5/27_0_808_485/master/808.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15d3026a083234cf922062606b46ed6c","title":"kiribati gesture of welcome to chinas ambassador must be understood from the islands perspective","story":"i-Kiribati writers say the media frenzy over the image of Tang Songgen walking on men’s backs diminishes local customs and culture The image flew around the world, far ahead of any understanding of what it represented.In the grainy picture, the Chinese ambassador to Kiribati was being welcomed onto the atoll island of Marakei. A row of young men lay face-down on the ground, their backs forming a path for the ambassador and his colleagues to walk across as they disembarked from a plane.A video shared on Facebook showed that as the ambassador got close to the end of the line, young men ran eagerly to join and extend the row further. The mood was celebratory.But the response to the photo was immediate outrage. The moment was described as a “disgrace”, “shameful”, “humiliating”, and a violation of human rights.Some assumed those on the ground were children and others joked about China “walking all over” the people of Kiribati. Stories and discussions were framed in terms of geopolitical anxieties viewing it as a form of Chinese colonialism and patriarchal culture and ignored the agency, voices and cultural rights of i-Marakei to greet and host dignitaries according to their own customs.As women, writers, and scholars of i-Kiribati descent, we felt it would be useful to address some of these issues.Kiribati is not unused to headlines. The archipelago nation – around 115,000 people spread across 32 low-lying atolls and one high island, and ning an area of 3.5m sq km, roughly the size of India – is on the frontline of climate change. Its leaders have become recognised over the years for lobbying for global climate policies and action.But this single image has catapulted Kiribati – specifically the atoll of Marakei – to intense global attention.Rae Bainteiti is an i-Kiribati youth leader whose grandmother is from Marakei. He said the picture that became a controversial debate topic, “is a stern reminder that sometimes, the global community needs to respect cultural protocols and social responsibilities that the land accords to their guests before commenting”.Marakei is an island steeped in stories and strong customs. It is known throughout Kiribati as the “women’s island”.An enclosed circular atoll, four female spirits protect Marakei and its people from intruders. Every visitor must first complete what is called te katabenin – an anti-clockwise journey around the island, introducing themselves to the female spirits, and leave behind an offering.The custom of Marakei is based on respect for female ancestral spirits, and decision making is made by elders of all genders – te unimane ao te unaine – in the traditional meeting house or maneaba.The practice of forming a path of human bodies for an honoured guest to walk across is mostly seen at weddings. It is understood as a cultural act that follows the way of the land or what is known broadly as te katei ni Kiribati.At weddings, the bride or groom arrives and processes across the backs of his or her new male in-laws.It is a great honour for the family on the ground and if someone declines to walk across them the insult is immense: akin to being seen as excrement to be avoided from stepping on.Clearly it was adapted here for another kind of guest and to signal a new relationship.We understand the Chinese ambassador was uncomfortable participating in the procession, but culturally and politically, to decline would have caused damage to his relationship with the people of Marakei and Kiribati more broadly.Teaote Davies, mother of co-author Marita, and whose own mother Terira was from Marakei, said: “That decision was not decided by some people having a cup of tea ... it must have been voted on and it was unanimous. I’m a child of Marakei but I stand outside of te maneaba. My opinions don’t matter, te unimane and te unaine have spoken.”Choosing this particular protocol was not particular to China and, indeed, we received confirmation from Teriba Tabe on Tarawa who had talked to members of the ministry of environment, lands and agricultural development who accompanied the ambassador, that an Australian high commissioner received a similar welcome at the opening of a junior secondary school on Marakei some years ago. Australia had funded one of the buildings. There is also an image circulating on social media of Taiwan’s ambassador being greeted in a similar way on Marakei in 2011.As Rae Bainteiti described: “If you decline, they will insist – if you keep declining, it is an offence to the whole island”.The media frenzy that circulated in response to the image potentially diminishes Marakei custom, culture and agency.It instead privileges geopolitical anxieties over Kiribati’s turn from Taiwan to China, an international but not culture-specific sense of diplomacy, and an Australian and American sense of territoriality.While Kiribati is clearly caught in a geopolitical tug-of-war, cultural rights and cultural self-determination matter, and are a source of i-Kiribati pride.This is an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of Pacific customs and to reflect on how cultural practices are adapted or changed over time.As long as they do not promote or condone violence, cultural and spiritual rights are also human rights.The choice to welcome and host visitors in this way is in the hands of i-Marakei elders and communities. What is out of their hands, and requires far more regional and global support, is prevention of the devastating impacts of climate change on all the islands.Katerina Teaiwa is Associate Professor in Pacific Studies at the Australian National University and descends from the islands of Banaba and Tabiteuea in KiribatiMarita Davies is an Australian based writer who descends from Marakei and Tabiteuea.

Brazil reported 23,421 new cases of coronavirus and 494 deaths in the past 24 hours, the health ministry said on Sunday.Brazil has registered 3,605,783 cases of the virus since the pandemic began, while the official death toll from Covid-19 has risen to 114,744, the second highest total after the US. Boris Johnson has issued a plea to parents to send their children back to the classroom when schools reopen next month.The UK prime minister said the risk of contracting coronavirus in schools is “very small”, and that pupils face greater harm by continuing to stay away from the classroom.Many pupils in England have not been to class since March when schools were closed except to look after vulnerable children and those of keyworkers.Schools in Scotland reopened earlier this month, while those in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to welcome all pupils from the beginning of September.Johnson said: “I have previously spoken about the moral duty to reopen schools to all pupils safely, and I would like to thank the school staff who have spent the summer months making classrooms Covid-secure in preparation for a full return in September.“We have always been guided by our scientific and medical experts, and we now know far more about coronavirus than we did earlier this year.“As the Chief Medical Officer has said, the risk of contracting Covid-19 in school is very small and it is far more damaging for a child’s development and their health and wellbeing to be away from school any longer.“This is why it’s vitally important that we get our children back into the classroom to learn and to be with their friends. Nothing will have a greater effect on the life chances of our children than returning to school.” In response, Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman Layla Moran said: “The government must rapidly upscale Test and Trace and ensure schools have the mental health support, financial resources and the use of community spaces they need ahead of opening fully.The front page of the  newspaper in the UK.Monday’s Times front page in the UK.The US Food \u0026amp Drug Administration (FDA) said it has authorised the use of blood plasma from patients who have recovered from Covid-19 as a treatment for the disease, a day after President Donald Trump blamed the agency for impeding the rollout of coronavirus vaccines for political reasons.The announcement from the FDA of a so-called “emergency use authorisation” comes as Trump has announced a news briefing for today where he is likely to make an announcement on the topic.The FDA early evidence suggests blood plasma can decrease mortality and improve the health of patients when administered in the first three days of their hospitalisation. It was not immediately clear what the immediate impact of this decision would be.Patients who benefited the most from this treatment are those under 80 years old and who were not on a respirator, the agency said. Such patients had a 35 percent better survival rate a month after receiving the treatment.“It appeared that the product is safe and we’re comfortable with that and we continue to see no concerning safety signals,” said Peter Marks, director of the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, on a conference call with reporters.The agency also said it determined this was a safe approach in an analysis of 20,000 patients who received this treatment.

File image: Dara Mac DónaillThe Phil Hogan was stopped by a garda while in Kildare, on route from Kilkenny to Clifden, for using his mobile phone while driving.Mr Hogan’s spokesman said he was cautioned and he did not receive penalty points.Earlier on Sunday, Mr Hogan’s spokesman said the Commissioner will not be resigning from his position, as controversy continued over his attendance at this week’s Oireachtas Golf Society dinner.Mr Hogan said he wished to apologise “fully and unreservedly” for attending the event along with more than 80 people.A Garda investigation is underway into the event, which took place just a day after the Government had decided to further limit the size of indoor gatherings under Covid-19 regulations to combat the spread of the virus.In a further development on Sunday, the golf society’s president Donie Cassidy has resigned as vice president of Fianna Fáil.The former TD and senator was among those involved in organising the event and made a speech at it.In his statement earlier on Sunday, Mr Hogan said: “I want, in particular, to apologise to the wonderful healthcare workers, who continue to put their lives on the line to combat Covid-19 and all people who have lost loved ones during this pandemic. I acknowledge my actions have touched a nerve for the people of Ireland, something for which I am profoundly sorry.“I realise fully the unnecessary stress, risk and offense caused to the people of Ireland by my attendance at such an event, at such a difficult time for all, and I am extremely sorry for this.“I acknowledge that the issue is far bigger than compliance with rules and regulations and adherence to legalities and procedures. All of us must display solidarity as we try to stamp out this common plague.“I thus offer this fulsome and profound apology, at this difficult time for all people, as the world as a whole combats Covid-19.“I spoke to both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste yesterday and I have listened carefully to their views, which I respect. I have been reporting to the President of the European Commission on all these matters in recent days.”A spokesperson confirmed in a statement to The  that Mr Hogan would not be resigning.Tánaiste and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar\u0026nbsptold RTÉ’s This Week programme that Mr Hogan’s apology on Sunday for attending the dinner in breach of public health guidelines had helped the situation.“It would have been better if it had come sooner but it definitely helps,” he said.“We need to make it clear to Commissioner Hogan and to the Irish people that we don’t condone his actions we are not accountable for them we are not going to defend them at all. It is up to him to account for his actions, to explain them and to satisfy people,” said Mr Varadkar.‘Consider his position’On Saturday Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Mr Varadkar asked Mr Hogan to “consider his position” as EU Commissioner after attending the event.“They both believe that the event should never have been held, that the Commissioner’s apology came late and that he still needs to give a full account and explanations of his action,” a Government spokesperson said on Saturday.Mr Hogan’s future as European Commissioner for Trade remains in doubt and the intervention on Saturday by the Taoiseach and Tánaiste is also likely to increase pressure on Supreme Court judge Séamus Woulfe, who was also in attendance at the golf dinner.Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar have not spoken to European Commission president Ursula Von der Leyen, who would have the power to remove Mr Hogan from office.On Sunday, Labour leader Alan Kelly urged the Taoiseach and Tánaiste to “inform” Ms Von der Leyen “that they no longer have confidence” in Mr Hogan and that he should resign.Mr Hogan’s appointment as Commissioner was ratified by the European Parliament after being nominated by the previous government.Event durationMeanwhile, the Oireachtas Golf Society is coming under further pressure to disclose the length of time more than 80 people were gathered at the dinner.Under Covid-19 restrictions announced by Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar two weeks ago, restaurants were required to close at 11pm, with diners allowed only an hour and 45 minutes for their meals.Revised restrictions announced last Tuesday – the night before the now infamous golf dinner – extended the closing time until 11.30pm, with table numbers capped at six people.One of those in attendance at Wednesday night’s dinner at the Station House Hotel in Clifden, Co Galway, said it started shortly after 9pm.There were a choice of three starters, including soup, pate and “some vegetarian or salady thing”, followed by a choice of three main courses, including salmon and lamb, and a choice of three desserts.After the meal there were four separate speeches, including from society captain and Independent TD Noel Grealish and Fianna Fáil councillor Donagh Killilea, who spoke on behalf of his family.The dinner was organised to pay tribute to his late father, the former Fianna Fáil MEP and TD Mark Killilea, as well as mark the society’s 50th anniversary.The now resigned minister for agriculture Dara Calleary also made a speech commemorating the late Mr Killilea.There was also a prize-giving, and according to one person present, families of winners took time to take photos.It is understood former Fine Gael minister Mr Hogan won one of the prizes, a George Foreman grill.One attendee couldn’t recall what time people left the function room, saying some stayed on to talk afterwards before everyone “scattered”.“It’s impossible to say, I wasn’t conscious of time,” said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.‘Multiple breaches’Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald told The  she was concerned “to hear reports of multiple breaches of public health guidelines” at the event.“We know the number of attendees exceeded the limit, but it has now been alleged that the event also lasted far longer than the time limit permitted,” she said.“The public needs to know if multiple breaches of the guidelines occurred.“I would ask those present at the dinner to clarify whether the length of time was compliant with the regulations and to be clear about how many regulation breaches took place. The attendees must be up-front about what happened and how the rules were breached. ”Ms McDonald said the Irish public was “understandably concerned about what happened and this drip feed of information and allegations risks undermining confidence in the public health guidelines at this critical time in the fight against Covid-19”.Some attendees stayed at rooms in the hotel where the dinner took place and others stayed in at least two other hotels in the town. Some remained on at the hotel lounge in the lobby afterwards.“We were assured everything was in order,” one said.“It was a cock up anyway, with the benefit of hindsight. The dinner shouldn’t have taken place.”As well as the more than 80 attendees, there was “a pile” of staff, with one or two waiters assigned to each table, according to one of the diners.Restrictions state staff should be included when calculating maximum numbers, meaning the gathering was several multiples of the latest allowed number of six for indoor gatherings, and comfortably more than the previous cap of 50.Mr Cassidy has said he will fully cooperate with a Garda investigation into the affair.Under Covid-19 regulations it is a criminal offence to organise an event with a larger number of people than is permitted by the regulations.All-expenses tripThe scandal is not the first time the Oireachtas Golf Society has courted controversy.In the summer of 2010, the society went on an all-expenses paid trip to Turkey for official celebrations of the 90th anniversary of the Turkish parliament, which had organised a golf tournament for parliamentarians from around the globe.Among those travelling were Mr Cassidy, Mr Grealish and then Carlow Kilkenny TD Mr Hogan.Then leader of the Seanad Mr Cassidy was forced to deny claims on his return that he had refused to reopen the Upper House alongside the Dáil the same week because he and his golfing colleagues were staying at the five star Sueno Hotels Golf Belek resort in the popular coastal resort Antalya.“I gave up my whole bloody weekend in the name of Ireland,” he said of his trip to Turkey at the time."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4336897.1598216812!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"phil hogan s brexit clout puts government in delicate situation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Government faces a huge decision on the future of European Commissioner Phil Hogan. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Government faces a huge decision on the future of European Commissioner Phil Hogan: does it seek to have him fired, or does it prefer that, on balance, he should remain in his post?Hogan is the commissioner with responsibility for trade, putting him in a pivotal position as the negotiations on a post-Brexit trade deal between the EU and the UK approach the critical stage in the autumn. But his attendance at the Oireachtas Golf Society dinner in Clifden last week has caused huge public anger, which continues to rage despite the resignation of Minister for Agriculture Dara Calleary. Hogan and Supreme Court judge Séamus Woulfe, who has also apologised for his attendance at the event, are now at the centre of the controversy.Sources suggest there are broadly two schools of thought in Government about Hogan’s future. The first holds that public anger over the dinner has so damaged trust in the Government to manage the pandemic that it must take extraordinary steps to regain that trust, or it will lead to a significant deterioration in public compliance with the restrictions. And if that happens, the concern is that infections will increase rapidly, threatening to overwhelm the health service. The resignation of Calleary and the disciplining of minor political figures who attended are not sufficient to assuage public anger. Hogan – particularly – and Woulfe are now the focus of that public anger, and must resign or be sacked, this school of thought goes. The Government can’t regain trust until they go, and so they must go.The second school of thought takes a less cataclysmic view and says: yes, but. It holds that while Hogan’s resignation would bring benefits to the Government, on balance the national interest is not served by having him resign at this point, when almost certainly his Irish replacement would not be allocated the trade portfolio.It acknowledges the damage done to public trust, but believes that, as with all scandals, the passage of time will ease public anger. People will get on with things, and the Government will get on with running the country. Right now, this mostly revolves around Covid-19 – but pretty soon it will include Brexit, in which Hogan’s help will be needed. Shift in toneLast night it seemed that the leaders of the Government were leaning towards the first school of thought. They issued a statement calling for Hogan to “consider his position” – normally a euphemism for resignation. However, in a radio interview earlier, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar struck a less uncompromising tone, saying Hogan’s abject apology on Sunday morning “helps” and that he needed to answer any further questions about the dinner and his movements around the country before it. (Hogan has faced questions about whether he broke the Kildare lockdown, which he denies.) The implication of Varadkar’s remarks was that if he could answer those questions to people’s satisfaction, he could perhaps remain in office. It is understood that this view is shared across the leadership of the Government parties, though some Ministers remain deeply sceptical.Ultimately, if the Government desperately wants Hogan gone, the Taoiseach will ask European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen to remove him. But that request is unlikely to be made unless there are further revelations or evidence of blatant inconsistencies in the account Hogan is preparing for his boss. Hogan is accountable not to the Irish Government but to the European Commission. Sources familiar with the commission say the threshold for removing a commissioner is high. Commissioners are often targeted by domestic political concerns, and Brussels does not want to have to become embroiled in the fractious politics of 27 countries. But in the context of a global pandemic, if a member of the commission is found to have violated national or local restrictions to the extent that the national government declares it has lost confidence in him – that would be hard for von der Leyen to ignore.

Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc can nations voice brexit says director general","story":"Britain needs the BBC more than ever to promote the country’s “voice and values” after Brexit, Lord Hall will claim on Monday. In his final speech as director-general, he will appeal to the government to “unleash the full global potential of the BBC” as the UK forges a new relationship with the world.The BBC needs more taxpayers’ money to combat a “second pandemic” of fake news spread by Russia and China, he will claim.During his virtual address at Edinburgh Television Festival, Lord Hall will attempt to set out his legacy as BBC director-general after seven years in the job. Tim Davie, a senior BBC executive, will replace him next month.“My goal, when I arrived at the BBC, was to double our global audience to reach 500 million people by 2022 – our centenary year,” Lord Hall will say.“With two years to go, we are today reaching 468 million people each week.“We have plans in place to double that ambition – to reach a global audience of one billion people by the end of the decade. But it needs extra investment from government and that bid is with them right now.”A BBC source said Lord Hall was referring to a bid for £100 million in government funding to bolster the World Service in countries including Russia and China.“This is about much more than protecting integrity in news, critical as that is,” Lord Hall will say during a virtual address.“It’s also about helping to protect our democratic integrity, and fostering unity and cohesion.“The forces of disinformation and social media tend to feed on fracture and drive polarisation. They’re often specifically designed to exploit ision for commercial or political gain to unsettle societies or undermine democracy.”His intervention comes amid a row with ministers after the BBC decided to force millions of over-75s to pay the licence fee. But Lord Hall urged the government to back the BBC as a diplomatic weapon as the UK seeks new trade after Brexit.He will cite research claiming an “exceptionally high correlation” between countries where people are aware of the BBC and places where people think positively of Britain.“No one can do more to carry Britain’s voice and values to the world. This could hardly be more important as Britain sets out to forge a new relationship with the world, based on an ambitious vision of ‘Global Britain’, he will say.“Success will mean drawing on all our considerable international assets. And that means unleashing the full global potential of the BBC.“More and more, in the fake news world, truth is a priceless commodity in our societies.“So let’s not forget that, in the BBC, the UK has a remarkable asset: the pre-eminent provider to the world of facts you can trust.”Lord Hall will suggest the BBC has a crucial role play in “bringing the country together” as it battles to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The disease has “brutally exposed fault lines of deprivation and demography”, he will say, adding “recession may well fan that anger and unfairness still further”.In recent years the BBC has been confronted with the the rise of digital streaming services such as Netflix as younger people turn away from traditional television to on-demand shows. Two years ago the corporation admitted that for the first time young people are spending more time watching Netflix than all of its BBC TV services each week.But Lord Hall will claim that he has left the BBC well placed to fight its commercial rivals, with digital services such as iPlayer making up for lost ground.“History is littered – not just in media, but across many sectors – with companies and organisations that failed to adapt to the digital world. Many great names have fallen,” he is expected to say. “The BBC isn’t one of them. We have made the pivot to a new world. We’re all set to compete with the very best in the global digital age.”Lord Hall’s tenure has been marked by bitter rows with his own female staff over equal pay. Earlier this year the broadcaster Carrie Gracie won a landmark discrimination case against the corporation over claims she had been paid less than her male colleagues. Further legal claims are expected to follow.In his farewell speech, Lord Hall will urge the BBC to put ersity at the heart of its recruitment strategy.“We need to attract people who are different, who have different ideas about what matters, who draw on different experiences, who come from different backgrounds,” he will say. “That for me is the argument for greater ersity. It’s about creativity – promoting talent to deliver erse thinking.  And that in turn brings about great programmes that make sense of and reflect the world in which we live. And we have got to be better at that than anyone else.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus has confirmed teenage angst abolished joy","story":"There are two ways of looking at youth. One is that you’re never more alive, with all those hormones coursing through you, doing everything for the first time, and that your subsequent life is a whittling away until you end up shedding bitter tears looking at photographs of your childhood sweetheart on Facebook.The other is that you’re just a shadow of your future self, running with the crowd and scared to stand out and that, as David Bowie said, “Aging is an extraordinary process where you become the person you always should have been.”One thing’s for sure in Western culture, we see “teenage” as a time when, as the song says, we should be young, be foolish but be happy. Even the Amish insist that young people leave their communities for a few years between the ages of 16 and 20 for “Rumspringa” which translates as “running around.”But what happens when the best years of your life are played out against a global pandemic and the world decides to ground you – counter intuitive to everything you feel inclined to do, from making out with perfect strangers to making your way in the big wide world?A recent survey by the Royal Society For Public Health claimed that three quarters of 18 to 24 year-olds are anxious about the future compared with only 47 per cent of the over-75s. With the recent fiasco over exam results, you could forgive the nation’s youth for being terrified that the grown-ups in charge are winging it in a way we simply don’t expect from our leaders.In turn, sometimes it’s hard not to feel impatient with the youth – ‘Now you’ve got something to boo-hoo about!’ – not because we old people are morally outraged by their wildness, as is the natural way, but because even before the pandemic they seemed to be carping fuss-budgets, timid beyond their years.With their allergies and anxieties and safe spaces and trigger warnings, forever being driven to climate change protests in their helicopter parents 4X4s, when they weren’t crouched over their computers looking up new reasons to worry, they were eschewing booze and sex and refusing move out in order to police their pleasure-seeking parents behaviour.Yes, these are cliches – but no more so than their equally dismissive “OK Boomer” attitude towards we baby-eating Brexiteers.Mind you, looking back, we’re fine ones to talk how my cohort loved to stomp around snarling “No future!” before going on to have an excellent time transforming ourselves into sexy-greedy Eighties go-getters. We were the last lucky generation, no doubt about it, with the Wild West End of London still affordable to live in (I bought a three-bedroomed flat in Bloomsbury in my early twenties on the strength of my job as a journalist – imagine that now!) and the media expanding at such a dizzying rate that one could be reviewing records for the pop press on a Monday and ensconced with a proper newspaper column on one of Fleet Street’s finest by Friday.I’m not at all a pessimistic person but I feel that the idea of being a teenager may revert to how it was before they were officially created in the 1950s – going straight from children to adults as soon as they can find work to support their poor old locked-down parents in the unimaginable wasteland of our devastated economy. Life certainly won’t be full of hope and adventure as my generation’s was – so much of the ambitious teenager’s life is about escaping to the big city, but who’s going to want to run away to London now there’s no there there?But let’s look on the bright side. Maybe growing up on a diet of dystopian novels and Billie Eilish fugues and dire warnings from Greta Thunberg will have tempered our young to be stronger than they seem. And if not, they can always comfort themselves with the fact that happiness declines from youth through middle age, hitting a low at 50 and rising to a peak at 70.By then a vaccine will surely have been found and the young – their clean-living ways finally paying off – can do all the things they haven’t had the chance to, as we did when we lived in modern times.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"generation z find full stops intimidating experts say","story":"Full stops have become the latest casualty of youthful sensitivity as experts say they can be “intimidating”.As teenagers and those in their early twenties, Generation Z, have grown up with phones in their hands, using short messages to communicate with one another, and the punctuation mark has fallen out of fashion and become a symbol of curt passive-aggression.Linguists have been debating the use of the full stop and why some young people interpret a correctly punctuated text as a sign of annoyance.Some argued that the full stop had become redundant, as a text was now ended simply by sending it, and the sentence did not need to be finished with a punctuation mark.Linguist Dr Lauren Fonteyn tweeted “If you send a text message without a full stop, it’s already obvious that you’ve concluded the message. So if you add that additional marker for completion, they will read something into it and it tends to be a falling intonation or negative tone.”Others said the effect of a full stop changed depending on the medium of the message.Owen McArdle, a linguist at the ­University of Cambridge, said: “I’m not sure I agree about emails. I guess it ­depends how formal they are.The meaning of the full stop in online communications has been a debate raging among linguists for years.Prof David Crystal, one of the world’s leading language experts, thinks the use of the punctuation mark is being “revised in a really fundamental way”.In his 2015 book, Making a Point, he explains that instead of its original purpose, signifying the end of a sentence, it has become an “emotion marker”, signifying anger or annoyance.He said: “You look at the internet or any instant messaging exchange – anything that is a fast dialogue taking place. People simply do not put full stops in, unless they want to make a point.The full stop is now being used in those circumstances as an emotion marker.”This is also backed up by science. A 2015 study by Binghamton University in New York, involving 126 undergraduates, found that they perceived text messages ending in a full stop as being less sincere than the same message without a full stop.Researchers also found that exclamation points did the opposite of full stops, making people seem more sincere and engaged.Research leader Celia Klin said at the time: “When speaking, people easily convey social and emotional information with eye gaze, facial expressions, tone of voice, pauses and so on. People obviously can’t use these mechanisms when they are texting. Thus, it makes sense that texters rely on what they have available to them – emoticons, deliberate misspellings that mimic speech sounds and, according to our data, punctuation.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"second lockdownmost english neighbourhoods havent had covid","story":"A second lockdown is unnecessary because 91 per cent of people in England live in neighbourhoods that have not seen a single case of coronavirus in a month, an academic has argued.Government scientists have warned that another national shutdown could be needed if cases rise in a similar way to Spain and France. Britain’s second largest city, Birmingham, is also facing local restrictions, amid a recent spike in cases. But Prof  John Clancy, of Birmingham City University, said putting the city into lockdown would be lunacy and warned current fears of a second wave were based on dodgy data.“According to the Government’s own testing figures, 87 of Birmingham’s 132 neighbourhoods did not record a single tested positive case of Covid-19 in the last week, so 716,000 Brummies live in a neighbourhood where there were no positive tests in the last week.“Fifty-three of the neighbourhoods (418,000 people) have not recorded a single case in the last 4 weeks. Forty-six neighbourhoods (371,000 people) have not recorded a single case in the last 8 weeks.”Prof Clancy, who is also the former leader of Birmingham city council, said the current testing numbers were low and unreliable and that testing in Britain was now in total chaos. “They are all over the place. And policy responses based on it will be chaos too,” he warned.“If the so-called spikes in places like Birmingham lead to reported Covid-19 hospital admissions or reported Covid-19 deaths, then there is cause for alarm. “But the reality is that increased and more widespread testing is leading, oddly enough, to finding more cases. This has not broadly led to increases in Covid-19 related deaths and hospital admissions in other so-called hotspots.”Last week Birmingham was placed on the national watch list by Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, and given ‘enhanced support’ to help prevent a lockdown. But there has been just one death recorded in the city in the past week and on Sunday, just six deaths were recorded for the whole of Britain. There are currently 834 patients in hospital with coronavirus, and 72 on ventilators.  Birmingham police said it had issued dozens of reminders of the need for social distancing after being called to more than 70 street and house parties and other unlicensed gatherings overnight.The force tweeted that they had dispersed dozens of parties, including one at Northfield on the outskirts of Birmingham which included two marquees and a DJ.“Everyone packed up and went home after we arrived,” Birmingham Police tweeted. “Please understand we are still in a pandemic.”In a separate tweet, the force said officers had ‘responded to over 70 street and house parties and other unlicensed events’ on Saturday night.The National Police Chiefs\u0027 Council has warned that forces in England and Wales will continue to increase patrols heading into the bank holiday weekend. Areas of concern, such as Leicester and Greater Manchester, have seen deployments larger than on New Year\u0027s Eve, it said.But Prof Clancy said: “So-called ‘spikes’ are occurring here, there, and everywhere up and down the country because new testing regimes are causing them either with false positives, picking up residual infections or (usually more likely) suddenly increased testing in specific areas.“‘Just in case’ lockdowns are simply not an acceptable response to dodgy data.

They said some homes were flooded and evacuations were underway due to Storm Laura, which earlier passed over Puerto Rico.Tropical Storm Laura moving over Haiti and the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean as a second tropical storm, named Marco moves into the Gulf CoastA woman was swept away in southeastern Haiti while trying to cross a fast-flowing river.

We don’t often have electricity in my neighborhood so I couldn’t follow the news on the radio, said Sony Joseph, trembling with cold.The Atlantic storm season, which runs through November, could be one of the busiest ever this year, with the Hurricane Center predicting as many as 25 named storms. Laura is the 12th so far.Haiti, a country of 11 million, has seen a relatively low incidence of COVID-19 – with just over 8,000 cases and around 200 deaths to date – but authorities urged caution to prevent further spread in the aftermath of Storm Laura.Wear your masks and respect distances, especially in temporary shelters, Interior Minister Audain Fils Bernadel said at a briefing Saturday. With COVID, we have considerably less capacity in our shelters.Storms pose a serious risk to Haiti every year from June to November. Even a heavy rainfall can threaten the country’s poorest residents, many of them living in at-risk zones, near canals or ravines that can be obstructed by debris and quickly overflow.The Hurricane Center said on Sunday that data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that Marco has strengthened into a hurricane with maximum winds of 75 mph (120 kmh) with higher gusts.Marco is predicted to weaken rapidly after moving inland across Louisiana on Monday and Tuesday.Boris Johnson appeals to parents to get children back to schoolEarl loses battle with stepmother over \u0026#39Macbeth\u0026#39s castle\u0026#39 visitors\u0026#39 centreFour million people could be tested daily for Covid-19 by early next yearBBC can be the nation\u0026#39s voice after Brexit, says director-generalPolice fear illegal raves will replace cancelled Notting Hill CarnivalCare homes asked to place blanket Do Not Resuscitate orders on residents at height of pandemicExclusive: Boris Johnson told to overhaul \u0026#39not fit for purpose\u0026#39 asylum systemGeneration Z feels intimidated by full stops, experts findSuperman does not fit windows... businessman incurs the wrath of DC Comics over his super van logoComment: The racist and sexist language of the Left is hopelessly hypocriticalGirl, 15, killed in speedboat accident as sister and mother are left with broken armsGavin Williamson hits back at holiday critics by revealing he cancelled family break to stay in UKSerial killer \u0026#39may be at large in North West\u0026#39, as murder-suicides reviewed by policeA second lockdown? Most English neighbourhoods haven\u0026#39t had a Covid case for a month, says academic Man dies in bungalow after next door property collapses onto roofTrump seeks to regain political initiative as Republicans gather for Charlotte conventionRule, Britannia! could be axed from slimmed-down Proms Companies accused of furlough fraud after data found two thirds of workers carried on working Admiral Nelson expected Navy to fund his life once Napoleonic wars ended, letter revealsBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/04/14/proms.jpg","title":"bbc proms last night rule britannia land of hope and glory","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.BBC organisers are reportedly considering the move amid debate over the anthems’ themes of slavery and colonialism“Rule Britannia” and “Land of Hope and Glory” may be dropped from The Last Night of the Proms, in a shakeup of the popular event. The Sunday Times reports that the BBC is discussing whether to remove the traditional anthems from the show, in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement. Both performances typically involve much flag waving from attendees. However, organisers are apparently wondering whether to scrap them due to the anthems’ perceived association with slavery and colonialism. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFinnish conductor Dalia Stasevska, who will perform on the Last Night, is among those reportedly keen to tone down the more overtly patriotic elements and give it a modern update. A spokeswoman for BBC Proms said: “We are still finalising arrangements for the Last Night of the Proms so that we are able to respond to the latest advice in regards to Covid-19 and deliver the best offering possible for audiences.”Regardless of whether the anthems are dropped, the BBC Proms 2020 will be noticeably different to previous years. The majority of the 2020 Proms season will be made up from highlights from the BBC archive. Two weeks of live shows will take place at The Royal Albert Hall from Friday 28 August.Last Night of the Proms\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspLand of Hope and Glory\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Fans have been tweeting about the dramatic transformation of the Irish actor, who stars opposite Robert Pattinson‘s Batman, as well as Zoe Kravtiz and Paul Dano.While there are plenty of talking points in the clip, which was shared by Reeves at the DC FanDome event on 22 August, it’s Farrell who has everyone worked up. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHis appearance, which was achieved with the help of prosthetics, is so different that many fans claimed they didn’t even realise it was him. “The craziest thing about The Batman trailer is that this is Colin Farrell,” one person tweeted.Writer and director Ben Mekler tweeted: “Colin Farrell in prosthetics as a character actor from the NY theater scene who breaks out with a best supporting actor nom for a stand-out role in a Coen Bros movie at age 53 as The Penguin is a vibe.”A number of fans said they had confused Farrell with fellow actor, Curb Your Enthusiasm star Richard Kind.In July, Farrell praised the script for the forthcoming movie and said it is unlike any previous adaptations.“The whole prospect is really exciting,” he said. “I’m ecstatic to be part of that universe. There are certain words that are part of my internal lexicon and those words are Gotham City, Penguin, Joker, Batman, Bruce Wayne, Harvey Dent... all of those things.“I have been watching the Batman films with my kids, but this script is something that feels incredibly original. It leans into it but it doesn’t borrow it’s born of the mythology of that character, Bruce Wayne, Batman and Gotham.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity.

This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Andy McDonald, the shadow secretary for employment rights, was forced to pay the funds back to parliament’s spending watchdog.MPs are allowed to rent out part of their local constituency offices. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut they have to hand the income over to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), which was set up in the wake of the expenses scandal a decade ago. The missing payments were uncovered only after IPSA carried out an inquiry into the subletting of MPs’ offices. Under the rules, MPs are also required to charge an appropriate fee for renting out the space.MPs offered extra £10,000 to help with cost of working from homeDozens of MPs are thought to sublet their local offices, often to councillors from the same political party. Details released by IPSA under a Freedom of Information (FOI) request show Mr McDonald had let out part of his office to the local Middlesbrough Labour Group.IPSA said that the rent charged had been £250 a year and that Mr McDonald had repaid £750. But a spokesman for Mr McDonald said the real figure repaid had been £500, with the final years’ rent simply handed over at the same time.  A spokesman for Mr McDonald said: ”As soon as Andy became aware, he reimbursed the money and now ensures all repayments are made on time. He apologises for the error.”A Labour Party spokesman said: “The public rightly expect all MPs to follow the rules to the letter and IPSA is right to ensure payments are made on time.”The FOI also shows other Labour MPs also had to repay money for their sublet office.

Ian Mearns, the Labour MP for Gateshead, also repaid £1,200 after charging rent of £120 a month. The name of his tenant was withheld by IPSA.  Last night Mr Mearns said there had been no deliberate attempt to defraud IPSA.He added: “I had no knowledge there was a problem of this nature and I think it has been dealt with in a routine way by my office management staff.”      The IPSA review looked into the subletting arrangements of 33 MPs, less than one in twenty, suggesting the problem could be much more widespread.The watchdog conceded that there had been “little oversight” of the system. All of Westminster’s 650 MPs have now been reminded of their duty to declare any revenue from subletting their offices.An IPSA spokesman said: “Subletting is within the rules and can be beneficial when it enables MPs to have sufficient office space to serve their constituents, whilst also returning some funds to taxpayers.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Some things are good and some are bad.FactCheck Twitter feed“I’d like to think the UK is not as bad as in other countries – the US is leading the way with that very muddy space.”In separate research, the fact-checking organisation First Draft found that Labour, the Conservatives, and the Liberal Democrats all published misleading advertising during the campaign.But the Tories were “by far the most frequent”, with 88 per cent of their most shared online adverts between 1 and 4 December containing misleading information, compared to 6.7 per cent for Labour.King’s College researchers said it was “difficult to calculate” whether the efforts had an impact on the election result, which saw Boris Johnson returned as prime minister with a majority increased by 47 seats.Tories set up fake fact-checking service for election debateThey warned that the coronavirus pandemic could operate as a measure of public trust in the governing party, adding: “On a daily basis, the government is trying to persuade British citizens that its reported death tolls are accurate.“It wants citizens to believe the message that it is ‘succeeding’ in controlling the epidemic, despite its recent electoral record of using disinformation tactics and admitting it unapologetically.”A spokesperson for the Conservative Party said it rejected what it called “wild assertions”.“All Conservative Party advertising was labelled, following best practice on digital imprints,” he added.“We are delivering on the promises the British public elected us on, getting Brexit done, investing in our public services and levelling-up across the country.“The research classed disinformation as a deliberate lie or misrepresentation, while misinformation can be created or spread accidentally.Dr Granelli said there was a perception that disinformation was “happening at a more industrial rate than has ever happened before” amid a global rise in online communications.Conservatives post misleading edited campaign video of Labour ministerBut she warned that it was hard to measure the impact on voting behaviour because the reasons for people’s decisions, or behind the views they form, were not fully known.Dr Granelli noted that the period since the 2016 EU referendum, which has seen two general elections, two Conservative and two Labour leadership elections, has meant party-political campaigning “continuing for a lot longer than it normally would”.The report called for more research to be done across multiple platforms to examine how false information spreads and takes root, calling claims that “Facebook, or bots, or the Russians are the core threat” a “misdiagnosis” of the problem.“A lot of the time, people are looking for information that reinforces their beliefs,” Dr Granelli said.“It might be their friends, parents, newspapers, celebrities or musicians.“It’s almost a perfect storm – the old gatekeepers have been removed and we haven’t found the right way to replace them.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGood Law Project’s letter claims the contract was unlawfully granted without any tender process and there was bias in play due to the company owners’ links to Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings. Ofqual’s controversial algorithm to be reviewed, regulatory body saysHow foreseeable was the A-level and GCSE fiasco, really?Government lifts cap on medical student places after A-level chaos A new grading system for qualifications had to be set up this year after exams were cancelled due to coronavirus. The government announced days after A-level results day that A-level and GCSE students could take teacher-assessed grades, following outcry over tens of thousands of A-level results being moderated down.An Ofqual spokesperson told  usual tendering rules did not apply to their contract with Public First  “due to the exceptional circumstances presented by the cancellation of exams” and “due to the need to urgently procure the work”. Good Law Project have said in their letter they believe there was enough time for a procurement process to go ahead after exams were cancelled in March.Exams fiasco ‘will be nothing compared to brewing scandal’ next yearRachel Wolf and James Frayne, the married couple who run Public First, “appear to have close personal and professional connections” with both Mr Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Mr Cummings, the UK prime minister’s chief adviser, their letter to Ofqual claims.

If they are not satisfied with Ofqual’s actions, they said they would issue judicial review proceedings in the High Court.Jolyon Maugham, the Good Law Project’s director, said: “We are now aware of three awards of contracts to Public First.“A river of public money is flowing into a business owned by close associates of the prime minister’s chief political adviser and his Cabinet Office minister – and all without any open, transparent tender process.”A Cabinet Office spokesperson told  Mr Gove had no involvement in the decision to grant the contract to Public First. Ofqual, Downing Street and the Cabinet Office have been approached by The Independent. Public First turned down a request for comment. An Ofqual spokesperson said: “Ofqual will respond to any correspondence in due course, once it has been received.”A government spokesperson said: “This is categorically untrue. No10 and the Cabinet Office had no involvement in the contract and did not discuss it with Ofqual. It is false to claim otherwise.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The competition, which sees a number of music heavyweights facing one another with their biggest hits, was launched in March. So far has included guests such as Erykah Badu vs Jill Scott, 2 Chainz vs Rick Ross, and DMZ vs Snoop Dogg.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMore than 20 years since the release of their R\u0026ampB hit “The Boy is Mine”, Brandy and Monica will now appear in a livestream on Monday 31 August, 8pm EST (1am BST).Brandy released her first album in eight years, B7, last month. Monica’s latest studio release was Code Red in 2015, which included guest features by Missy Elliot, Lil Wayne, Timbaland and Akon. The pair were the subject of major tabloid scrutiny during the Nineties, over speculation that the feud in their song had spilled over into a real-life one. While they consistently denied any rift, a planned performance at the 1999 Grammy Awards – where “The Boy is Mine” won Best R\u0026ampB Song by a Group or Duo – was called off. Just two years ago, Brandy changed the lyrics to “the song is mine” during her set at the 2018 Essence Fest.The Brandy vs Monica Verzuz episode will be streamed live from Tyler Perry Studios on Monday 31 August.

I can excuse the caution of Boris Johnson and Gavin Williamson deciding it was better to be safe than sorry in the early days of an unknown pandemic.But as the weeks turned into months and Generation Corona effectively lost a school year, I will never forgive the militant teaching unions for keeping them shut regardless of the social cost.It was a partisan play designed to damage a Tory government at a time when politics should not have mattered one iota.Unfortunately, the A-levels mess this week was depressingly inevitable from the moment the school gates slammed shut.A knee-jerk decision to cancel all exams without waiting to seethere was a way they could be sat in a socially distanced manner meant the current crisis was unavoidable.This situation CANNOT ever be repeated — but I’m fearful it’s already happening.Coronavirus is now being used as an excuse not to provide anything slightly dficult or complicated in all areas of our lives.But when it comes to education, the costs of that lazy caution are too great.I don’t know about you, but much of the development I experienced at school was down to my social interactions and extracurricular activities, rather than solely what was taught on the blackboard.Yet many schools are intending to use Covid- to justy axing breakfast and after-school clubs, banning music lessons and school productions, and stopping sports.It breaks my heart to see these opportunities indefinitely wrested from our youngsters with no scientic evidence to back up why.But it is being caused by a desire from adults to avoid ato normality.A King’s College London study this week revealed a majority of the public are supportive of our nightmarish “new normal”, with  per cent believing employees should be able to keep working at home until a vaccine is discovered and administered.This is cloud cuckoo land thinking. While the progress in Russia and at Oxford University looks positive, there is no guarantee we are going to have a vaccine at all.  So here’s an unpleasant newsflash: Covid is going to be part of our lives for many years. After all, smallpox is the only infectious disease to ever have been eradicated.Selfish adults can ruin their own lives by giving in to irrational hysteria, but they shouldn’t be allowed to destroy the fair education of our kids.The fightback against militant education unions, box-ticking bureaucrats and cruel social distancing regulations for students must begin today.MUCH media attention this past week has been focused on Labour MP Dawn Butler’s dubious claim that London cops are institutionally racist because they pulled over her and a black mate, even though they were driving in a vehicle with tinted windows, meaning the officers had NO IDEA of their colour.What’s far more disturbing is the release of new figures showing violent assaults on Met officers have increased by  per cent in the past three months, coinciding with a period of social unrest sparked by coronavirus and Black Lives Matter protests.Our police are under attack from all angles.They are filmed by baying members of the public desperate to show discrimination but unable to release their own body cam footage.They are accused of racism simply for arresting criminals.Andwe’re not careful, they will give up trying to stop many crimes because the potential repercussions aren’t worth it.DISTURBING news for celebrity lovers: The stars you probably think are nice are usually utter horrors in real le and those with bad reputations publicly are often delightful off camera.That’s my experience after two decades reporting on the entertainment industry both here and in Hollywood.So I’m fascinated to see a celebrity not being nice is now an offence that can see them be “cancelled”, becausethat goes on, there won’t be many left on the telly.This week, in one of the biggest celebrity reporting injustices I’ve ever seen, Nadia Sawalha was hit by claims she is nasty behind the scenes.Believe me, I saw it all over ten years working at ITV Daytime, but can vouch that the Loose Women star is one of the kindest and most genuine people I have ever met in the toxic world of showbiz.To suggest she is some sort of fake is beyond the pale.Nadia is adored by everyone backstage, her best friend is one of the broadcaster’s make-up artists, and she cares deeply about the folk she works with.While some TV stars don’t know the names of crew members they’ve worked with for years, Nadia befriends most of them.The vulnerable, self-deprecating, caring and honest-to-a-fault list you see on Loose is the real woman I know and adore.FIRST the US broadcaster HBO axed Gone With The Wind, before introducing a so-called “trigger warning” to the start of the classic film.Now it has sparked further outrage by doing the same thing to the Mel Brooks classic Blazing Saddles.If this woke attack on our culture continues, soon virtually every old film favourite will come with a sombre introduction by a liberal university professor outlining the social ills you’re about to witness.That got me thinking about what will end up being said before my three favourite films of all time :Grease: Contains ious examples of toxic masculinity, with Kenickie inappropriately invoking rape culture when he asks DannySandy “put up a fight”.The Wizard Of Oz: The scarecrow uses make-up to change the colour of his skin in an early example of blackface.The Sound Of Music: Glamorises a handsome young Nazi soldier called Rolf and features emotional abuse by the captain of his children, including the use of a whistle for discipline.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But celebration must be tempered with pragmatism: The scarring effects of lockdown will be felt for months,not years, to come.For a full recovery, we must all make a concerted effort to shore up the economy by going out to work, pubs and the shops.JUSTICE Jeremy Baker, who sentenced Manchester Arena co-conspirator Hashem Abedi to a record  years behind bars, is a credit to our justice system.Working with his brother, bomber Salman Abedi, the depraved criminal inflicted unimaginable suffering on innocent young victims and their families.

In the Iowa caucuses, the first electoral contest of the campaign to become his party’s candidate, the -year old finished in a humiliating fth place. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it. We took a gut punch,” Biden declared after the disastrous result. One commentator on the news outlet CNBC was even more scathing: “His presidential hopes are finished.”Yet today, Biden stands on the threshold of the Oval Office. Victory is in his grasp. Having clawed his way back into the primaries and won the Democratic nomination to challenge Donald Trump, he could soon be the most powerful man on Earth. It is certainly his fight to lose. Some nationwide opinion polls put him no less than  points ahead of Trump, whose popularity has taken a battering because of the coronavirus crisis and the consequent economic recession. This week’s Democratic convention, including his own powerful, well-crafted speech last night, will have done nothing to undermine his lead.But with some worrying signs of mental decline, Bidens coronation could mean the reigns of power are actually handed to the hardline leftists around him - rather than to the ageing politician himself.What makes Biden’s comeback all the more remarkable is that his two previous attempts to reach the White House failed so miserably. In  his campaign fell apart after he was exposed plagiarising one of the speeches made by Neil Kinnock during the British General Election the previous year. Some of the passages were lted almost word for word. “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to go to university ” asked the Labour Leader.“Why is Joe Biden the first in his family ever to go to university ” asked the Democratic Senator. It does not say much for either Biden’s creativity or his judgement that he had to seek secret inspiration from a socialist mediocrity widely known at Westminster as the Welsh Windbag.In  Biden did even worse, dropping out after a woeful performance in the Iowa Caucuses, where he gained just one per cent of the total vote. During the campaign, he regularly put his foot in his mouth, most notoriously when he described his rival Barack Obama as “the first African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy”.This year, after Iowa, his chances seemed to be heading in the same sorry direction.But then, in the following months, he gradually emerged as the front-runner. This was mainly because the other leading candidates were seen as either too extreme or too unlikeable. Senator Elizabeth Warren was a hard advocate of toxic identity politics who unconvincingly claimed to have Native American blood. Bernie Sanders was North America’s answer to Jeremy Corbyn, complete with revolutionary economics and brutish tax plans. Peter Buttigieg was a sanctimonious mayor of a small city in Indiana, without any experience of the national stage.In contrast, Biden had not only been a Delaware senator for  years, but had also served as Vice-President throughout Obama’s time in the White House. Through these roles, he had built up a reputation as a moderate, helped by his image as an ordinary, down-to-earth guy rather than a member of the Washington elite.The son of a used car salesman, he was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the place where the US version of Ricky Gervais’s comedy The Office was set. His popular appeal was further enhanced by his personal story of having to cope with agonising grief, which he spelt out in raw, emotive terms last night.The catalogue of anguish includes the loss of his first we and daughter, killed in a car accident in  and the death of his son Beau from brain cancer in . Yet none of this can hide a disturbing reality about Biden, one that makes him profoundly unsuited to be the leader of the free world or the commander-in-chief of the US military.It is something that the Democrats have desperately tried to downplay, along with much of the media. But, the fact is that Joe Biden is in steep mental decline. Already by far the oldest Presidential candidate in history, he shows all the signs of advancing senility. He might be able to read effective from an autocue, as he showed last night, but in other settings, away from the podium, he regularly stumbles over his words, confuses facts, loses his train of thought, and lapses into coherence. His supporters say that he has always been “gaffe-prone” and that is true, but the problem goes much deeper. In the past, Biden could be sharp, even witty, as he showed in his triumphant  Vice-Presidential debate against the Republican Paul Ryan.Today, when speaking off the cuff, he struggles to string basic sentences together.Without the help of a teleprompter, this is a man who mixes up his we and sister, gets the names of countries wrong, and keeps repeating the same phrases. In one bizarre outburst in Iowa, he called a female reporter “a lying, dog-faced pony soldier”. In another contribution, he declared that he will “choose truth over facts”. With a delusional grasp of arithmetic, he has said that million women will be put back to work by his tax credit plan, that million Americans have been killed by guns since , and that million have died from Covid-. That is why, throughout the campaign, his minders have tried to keep him in his Delaware home, almost like a hostage. Major interviews have been banned, public appearances strictly rationed. It is a strategy that his team cynically justy by claiming that they want to protect the -year-old candidate from Covid-. But the determination to shield the potential next President from any accountability makes a mockery of democracy.It might seem bizarre that the Democratic party should march under the tattered standard of such a weakened general. But from the viewpoint of political operators on the left, his decline actually makes him an ideal candidate.His senility might have to be concealed from the public, but it can be ruthlessly exploited in private. Broken and bewildered, Biden is a puppet whose strings can easily be pulled by his hidden masters. Behind the thin veneer of his supposed moderation, the radicals can seize power and enact their hardline policies, like defunding the police, imposing financial reparations for slavery, rewriting American history, confiscating wealth, promoting transgender ideology, extending public ownership, and widening the scope of affirmative action. Precisely because he is now an empty vessel, a Biden Presidency would mean the ruthless enforcement of woke dogma. In fact, its unlikely that he will last a full four-year term. Therefore his Vice President Kamala Harris, an ambitious operator can start preparing for her reign.But perhaps she should not be too hasty. The Democrats’ opportunism could backfire badlyvoters become alienated by the idea of an enfeebled President.After all, the American political structure – in contrast to our Parliamentary system – is built on the concept of a strong executive headed by a powerful, elected head of state. Already Trump, never one to pull his punches, is running adverts that highlight concerns about the “cognitive decline” of “Sleepy Joe”. The commercials seem to be having an impact. Almost  per cent of Americans do not think that Biden will serve a full term, while other polls show the race narrowing. Trump could also be boosted by revulsion at the radical Democrats’ agenda, especially the collusion with urban violence.In  widespread unrest fuelled by the civil rights movement enabled the Republican Richard Nixon to defeat the Democrats under Hubert Humphrey. Famously, Nixon said that the “silent majority”, ignored by the media, had spoken. Today the same public mood could give Trump a second term.It would be no more than the Democrats deserve for their eagerness to hide the real Joe Biden.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Politicians have repeatedly let us down, their lack of clarity is baffling and there still appears to be no coherent plan.I’ve watched as people cared for the sick and mourned their dead, and at times, like many of you, I’ve been overwhelmed by dread.Then I look at my friend and colleague Kate Garraway, who has had to bear the burden of her husband Derek being ambushed by Covid- in April.Kate has been extraordinary, which is why I am furious with those who have criticised her for ing to work, when they have absolutely no idea of what she has been going through. She has decided to step back from GMB for a while to concentrate on Derek and their children and those who have criticised her should be ashamed of themselves for making things even more dficult for the whole family. Derek may now be free of the virus but the after-effects have been catastrophic.The poor man has been in an induced coma, and although now more aware of his surroundings, he is still extremely ill.Kate’s mantra “where there is le, there’s hope”, has kept her going, and I reckon on some level Derek is aware of how much she and their children, Darcy, , and -year-old Billy are willing him to make a recovery.Kate has been astonishingly brave and positive throughout this whole ordeal, although she was tearful this week when talking about Derek’s recent birthday. His family sang Happy Birthday to him via Facebook, which must have been bittersweet for all of them.She has had to maintain a brave face for her children and give them some sort of stability for the past five months.To try to further give their lives a bit more normality, Kate went back to work last month.In fact, she was actively encouraged to do so by doctors who felt it was essential for her wellbeing, and frankly, she has to make a living because she has two children to take care of.I know coming back to presenting duties on Good Morning Britain wasn’t easy for Kate, and there have been a few wobbles when she has given updates on how Derek is doing, but all of us are so proud of the way she has coped.That’s why the nasty, malicious carping from moronic trolls is so upsetting. How dare they have a go at Kate for hosting the show and having the “audacity” to smile and laugh at funny items with her co-hosts. It’s sickening, and no matter how much anyone tries to ignore such malevolent cretins, Kate will have been deeply hurt.I had a horrible feeling this might happen, but thankfully the vast majority of viewers wish her nothing but the best, and would be overjoyed to see Derek on the road to recovery. All of us admire Kate’s courage and honesty and know that even in the darkest of times, it’s vital to hang on to positivity and yes, to even have a giggle at something silly or absurd.Watching their mum back on TV gave much needed routine and stability to Darcy and Billy, especially seeing her smile and having fun. They knew it didn’t mean she is not worried sick about their dad, but were well aware he would want her to continue working and providing for the family.As a journalist, Kate has amassed so much knowledge about Covid- and she has also been tested to her very limits.Typically, she wants to pass on that knowledge to help others and is planning to write a book about her experiences and what she has learned during this tough time. It was always her plan to do a self-help book and she had begun it before the pandemic, but now her wise words will be even more relevant and helpful than ever. I can’t wait for the day when Derek is back home, growing stronger every day and the whole family is finally reunited, and I hope she is back at work with us very soon.Happy Birthday Madonna –  years old, mad as a box of frogs but looking utterly radiant surrounded by her children at a party in Jamaica.She can be infuriating and even downright bonkersbut there’s no one quite like her.She’s a trailblazer, was always a staunch ally for the LGBT community before it was trendy and has always paddled her own canoe.Long may Her Madge continue to reign, especially as right now we need some light relief wherever we can get it. I’M not in the least bit surprised that “dad bods” have become so popular among women of all ages. These are the bodies belonging to men who proudly show off rather cute little pot bellies and love handles.Becoming softer round the edges usually happens to blokes after the birth of a couple of kids, when they start to comfort eat due to lack of sleep and stop being obsessed with going to the gym.These boys trade top-of-the-range bikes and tight Lyrca cycling gear for comfy joggers while pushing a pram, and are all the better for it.Having a dad bod is also seen as a sign of confidence, being happy in your own skin and showing that you enjoy le and that having a weekend pizza and a couple of beers is more than OK.I reckon there’s nothing more off-putting than a man with a ripped six-pack who is no stranger to the mirror and exists on steroids and just steamed vegetables.They are usually dull, self-obsessed and not in the least bit alluring.Dad bods are far less intimidating and much more fun to cuddle. Like a lot of men, famous stars including Leonardo DiCaprio and Zac Efron have developed the Dad Bod during lockdown and have been roundly showing off their new physiques.I think they are far more sexy and desirable than when their cheekbones could cut through a home-made loaf. You have to get the balance right, though. When it tips over into a very large balcony hanging over “the nursery” then that’s no longer a Dad Bod but just a big old beer gut and it shows a man who has simply given up and is on a fast track to obesity and a heart attack. BRITNEY Spears is a grown-up woman with two teenage sons, a hugely successful music career and an adoring fan base. But the -year-old has less freedom than an impoverished girl in a Jane Austen novel.Since her much-publicised meltdown in  – when she went into a beauty salon and shaved her head, looking like a little lost deer caught in the headlights – Britney has had very little control over her le.Her father Jamie has legal “conservatorship” over his daughter, basically deciding where and how she lives her le and conducts her career. He also keeps hold of the purse strings.Last year he stepped away from the role, citing health problems of his own . . . and Britney doesn’t want him back.Thirteen years ago she was clearly suffering with mental health issues and needed her father’s help.But now Britney understandably wants control of her own destiny.This week she decided to fight back and took to the courts to have her human rights and civil liberties restored.But her bid was unsuccessful and she will need to wait until February  before taking further action.She is a fragile woman and obviously needs support. But looking at it from the outside, the kind of control her father exerts over Britney’s le seems way too much.Surely some kind of compromise can be reached, with the situation regularly revised to ensure Britney isn’t left feeling trapped like a songbird in a very gilded cage.I SIMPLY cannot begin to imagine the pain actor John Michie and his family are going through right now.This week, the man who supplied the drugs that killed John’s daughter in  had his manslaughter conviction quashed.Louella Fletcher-Michie had gone to a music festival with her boyfriend, Ceon Broughton, who gave her the hallucinogenic C-P drug and filmed her tripping for hours. Belatedly realising she was in real trouble and crying for her mum, he phoned her family. They rushed to the scene but were too late to save her. Crucially, he did not at any point take her to a medical tent or seek expert help.This week a High Court judge decided that evenhe had called for paramedics, it was not clear Louella would have survived – so Broughton’s appeal against his sentence of eight and a half years was upheld. Broughton has to live with his actions but not from behind bars.Meanwhile, John and his family – who have maintained a dignied silence through the most recent twist of the kne in their tragedy – continue to mourn their lost Louella.For them, it is a le sentence of heartbreak and pain.JUST when you thought reality telly’s Below Deck couldn’t get any better, they go and set a whole series in Tahiti.There are all the usual shenanigans. Entitled and demanding guests, the crew squabbling one minute and at it like rabbits the next and Captain Lee sailing above it all while coming out with hilarious one liners like: “I’m madder than a p***ed-on chicken”, which I plan to use as often as possible in my daily le.Meanwhile, all the action takes place amid the amazing sunrises and stunning sunsets of the South Pacic.It’s no exaggeration to say that this utterly ludicrous, vacuous and extremely daft series has kept me sane during these scary times.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I co-hosted with the brilliant Jayde Adams, we had turns from Kerry Godliman, Shappi Khorsandi, Nathan Caton and Ed Gamble, and video messages from Aisling Bea and Nish Kumar, audiences watching on Zoom — something no one had ever imagined five months ago — on Facebook, and on Twitch, which I had assumed was an app for people in their twenties to chat each other up and worse.It was a brilliant night and the absolute kicker was that we had people in the room with us laughing .They were told not to overdo it for fear of aerosol transmission, but by God it felt good to have a real flesh-and-blood audience in front of me.Because here’s the thing about stand-up comics — they need an audience the way fish need water or Gavin Williamson needs chaos.But what we’ve discovered over the past couple of months, via these streamed gigs and now via gigs like the one I did on Sunday afternoon, in a car park under a gazebo, is that audiences seem to need stand-up too.It’s incredibly flattering, even for an old stager like me. On Sunday I played to  people prepared to ignore what the weather app on their phone might be saying, bring their camping chairs and sit in a car park in Tring, Herts.The comedians all seemed to savour every second of being on stage, of the delicious business of strangers laughing at their jokes together and sharing a mo-ment, a communal moment that means a lot after all these long months of doing what we’ve been asked and staying apart.Psychologically, what that might say about comedians is maybe not the thing we want to dwell on, what sort of wreck would need the laugh-ter of strangers to get them through the day  Move on!But this weekend’s gigs and the ones now springing up all over the country show that we all need the laughs it seems, the audiences too, and that nothing beats seeing it live, right there in front of you. And we can hear the laughs through the masks, don’t worry. There are more and more gigs springing up now, promoters and venues are innovating like mad, councils are doing everything they can to help get things off the ground.Some of these shows are outdoors, weather permitting affairs, some of them are under marquees and the like. Theatres are just getting going with shows with reduced capacity — at some places they’ll take your temperature on the way in, but it’s worth it for the laughs.Listings are popping up all over social media — you’ll find something near you. Don’t miss out. The shows that have been put together so far have been unforgettable and,nothing ,and when theatres do get up and running again, you can say: “Remember the time we saw this comic in a car park ”There’s something pretty exciting about seeing someone you’d have to go to an arena to see playing in a pub garden, too. Andit rains, well, stf upper lip and a good raincoat should get you through that. Hand on heart, the threat to our business is really worrying, like it is to any other right now, becausethe clubs close they will cut off the chance for new comics to get their acts together — literally — and for the new talent to come through. It’s all right for the likes of me, but the people who were set on going to the Edinburgh Fringe this summer — an event that has produced a ton of the funny people you might be familiar with — won’t get the chance for this year to be their year. Everyone has to start somewhere, andthe venues die, the whole thing dies.And that’s why it has been so amazing to see stuff being put on all over, in courtyards, pub gardens, car parks — even the biggest names can be seen doing their thing under an awning or gazebo — the audiences totally up for it and loving every moment. Because stand-up, like le, will find a way. And Jeff Goldblum knows, he used to do a bit of stand-up.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And lots of parents have been alarmed to see their children stuck at home, in-active and putting on weight.Mr Fry says: “Schools have to do something about this. We will have to measure pupils next month and again in spring to seewhat has been creeping up during this enforced period of inactivity has been countered by being back at school.”I could not agree more that schools need to do something about this issue. But bringing back weighing kids in schools is problematic.Plenty of people have spoken up about how traumatic they found it being weighed at school, and the humiliation of being told they were overweight.But much worse is how many people have said that was the trigger for a letime of disordered eating.Jameela Jamil, the star of Netflix sitcom The Good Place, says: “Being weighed at school was truly the minute my eating disorder started at . I can trace it back to that exact day.”Cycling champ Elinor Barker, who won gold at the  Rio Olympics, reckons her own experience as an elite athlete shows “lighter is not always better”.She says: “I was the heaviest I’ve ever been when I won the Olympics. At my lightest I could barely get through a training week.”I have not heard anyone credit school weigh-ins with keeping them fit and healthy, with a balanced and positive relationship to food.Weighing children is problematic for so many reasons. It sends the message that they alone are responsible for their weight, when in fact taking care of their bodies with the right food and exercise is as much down to their parents, their school and the adults around them.But also, it becomes a form of body-shaming, and encourages children to focus only on the digits on the scales rather than the much bigger picture.It can plant the seeds of a letime of dficulty around food and is very often counterproductive.There are so many other ways to help children take responsibility for their own health.Schools need to make sports fun, ied and accessible to all children.In particular, they need to find ways to encourage teenage girls to participate, as this is the age when they often drop out of sports.School meals need to be healthy and delicious.And schools need to take meal times seriously and encourage children to do the same.We also need to inspire children to want to be healthy and fit. What about more talks in schools from sportsmen and women on how to exercise and what to eat  They are such good role models.Parents also have a massive role. We lead by example andwe have an unhealthy relationship with food, it’s likely our children will too.If we teach children about what their body needs to work properly, and how to cook tasty, nutritious meals which deliver that, they will be engaged in a positive way that has nothing to do with shame or guilt.HAPPY nd birthday, Madonna.She and toyboy Ahlamalik Williams, celebrated with an extravagant bash at Jamaica’s GoldenEye resort.And anyone who saw photos and videos of her shenanigans could be forgiven for thinking she is half her age.As she left the island, she posted on Instagram: “Thank you Jamaica. We have picked your flowers, eaten your fruit, danced to your music, enjoyed every sunset.”Whatever you think of her, there is something enviable about her ability to make the most of le.I hope I look as good as she does at her age but, more importantly, I hope I am still having as much fun.Some say: “Grow old gracefully.”She proves it is much more fun to grow old disgracefully.Celebrities have the potential to really make an impact and change lives – but not all of them do.So I love the story this week that Taylor Swt has donated more than £, to Vitoria Mario, a Tottenham teenager who started a GoFundMe appeal to become a mathematician, describing herself as a “black -year-old with a dream”.Vitoria, had been offered a place at Warwick University to study maths but could not afford to take it because she did not qualy for a student loan.When Taylor saw Vitoria’s GoFundMe appeal, she gave her the entire amount she had left to raise, along with a message saying: “I am so inspired by your drive and dedication to turning your dreams into reality . . . Good luck with everything you do! Love, Taylor.”Imagine waking up to that message .Cynics might suggest that Taylor does things like this for the publicity.But eventhat is true, who cares Vitoria will never forget this and it will likely change her le for ever.Also, how impressive that she found a way to follow her dreams and get the money she needs to go to university.We could all take a leaf out of the book of Britain’s oldest coronavirus survivor.At the grand old age of , she has revealed her secrets to staying healthy are eating an orange a day and “counting your blessings”.Angela Hutor has lived through both World Wars, as well as the Spanish Flu pandemic of .She caught Covid- in April and was so close to death that her daughter was called to hospital to say her final goodbyes. But Angela bounced back.Her advice this week to family and friends is to keep calm and occupied.Angela, from North London, is adamant Britain “will get through this” – and given all that she has survived, she should know.So let’s all take that on board. This lady has a great attitude, something we should all adopt.Frankie Bridge is under fire for posting a photo of her children watching iPads at the dinner table – with some people up in arms about how unacceptable it is.But perhaps people in glass houses should not throw stones.By which I mean that anyone who has children and wants to have a nice time knows kids are not always great at sitting through long, fancy dinners out.Some people think going out to dinner is a treat and children should learn to behave properly.Butyou ask young kids to sit and wait for their food, they will get restless.And there is a definite argument that going out to dinner should be a treat for the adults too.If that means a bit of screen time for the kids while at the table, well, who am I to judge GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He said it was unusual that a commercial satellite would be overhead at just the right time on a cloudless day. The expert claimed that the mysterious underground base was a means of China covertly storing its military hardware - which included submarines and missile systems based inland. He continued: The Chinese have tremendous experience building underground facilities.Its in keeping with their strategic culture. The Yulin base is located on the southern end of Hainan Island, some  miles southwest of Hong Kong.It is considered one of Chinas key strategic outposts to protect its navy. Mr Thompson said that the country has a large and growing submarine fleet, which they are able to protect with underground facilities. A spokesperson for the US navy told CNN that the navy had sent one of its P-A Poseidon intelligence and reconnaissance jets on a flight near the base.The Type  submarine, believed to be the submarine seen in the pictures, is one of six in the Chinese fleet, according to the nonprofit Nuclear Threat Initiative.

It reveals:Downing Street is pushing hard for a trade deal but is making  contingency plans for an “unruly” exit from the EU transition period at the end of December.With trade talks looking set to go the wire, there is a risk they collapse — putting up trade barriers overnight on  January.In that scenario planners believe France will force “mandatory controls on UK goods from day one” and between  and  per cent of hauliers travelling across the Channel may not be ready for this.That could see flow between Dover and Calais down  per cent for three months, triggering long queues of HGVs in Kent.It could lead to shortages of the  per cent of our food imported from the EU as well as medicines, chemicals for drinking water purication and fuel supply.This could trigger water rationing and even power cuts.Food supply across the country would be hit by panic buying at Christmas, the busiest time of year.There are also increasing fears in Whitehall that Covid- willwith a vengeance in the winter months.The planners warned that “pandemic influenza, severe flooding, a Covid second wave and an unruly exit from the EU transition period could cause a systemic economic crisis with major impact on ­disposable incomes, unemployment, business activity, international trade and market stability.”It could be combined with likely “coordinated industrial action” as well as shortages risking public disorder and a mental health crisis that will hit the poorest hardest.

It means some town halls may go bust and need bailing out or may need to be under direct control of Whitehall.And inflation could “signicantly impact social care providers due to increasing staff and supply costs”.Ministers have also been told to brace for a further  months of virus infections in care homes.There are fears of public disorder as a result of shortages and a major economic slump.The outlook is also bleak for Gibraltar and the Channel Islands, both reliant on imports.Gibraltar could be cut off from Spain and economically crippled and the Channel Islands may need airdrops of medicines and food.Three quarters of UK medicine imports come through Dover, and many have a limited shelf le — making stockpiling dficult. During the pandemic the focus on Covid has led to a slump in animal vaccine production.

And lockdowns cause deaths.”Government scientists have warned that another national shutdown could cases spike.Many nations in Europe - such as France and Spain - are seeing a rise in cases. Some towns and cities are also facing the threat of local lockdowns, such as Birmingham - which has seen  cases in the last week.Professor Clancy, who is also the former leader of Birmingham City Council, warned current testing numbers are low and unreliable.He said: The reality is that increased and more widespread testing is leading, oddly enough, to finding more cases. This has not broadly led to increases in Covid- related deaths and hospital admissions in other so-called hotspots.Birmingham has been placed on the national watch list by Health Secretary Matt Hancock after a rise in cases.Police have been cracking down on enforcing social distancing, and said last night they were called to more than  street and house parties.However, Professor Clancy said the government data shows  of Birminghams  neighbourhoods did not record a single positive case of coronavirus last week.He also pointed out the apparent  per cent jump in the number of casesper , over the past two weeks is actually just an increase of six people. The expert said: These are micro-numbers, and talking about them in terms of spikes just won’t do. It is certainly not enough to spark policy change.He warned local officials risk over-reacting to apparent spikes.And he said the decisions should be taken by national government as city politicians do not have a signicant enough democratic mandate.   Professor Clancy explained he backed hyper-local intervention to try and beat the coronavirus.And he added officials should only be alarmedthere is a spike in deaths, saying theyare sadly the most reliable figure during the pandemic.Britain recorded six deaths today, while England recorded a new low of one.He said: What you can’t have is local lockdown panic without a wider context. Otherwise you’ll get ridiculous decisions to lockdown completely unrelated to the actual risk.Hyper-local intervention in very local areas of concern is a much better future option. Shutting down regions and cities will be ineffective, and has already been seen to be so.He added: Until we get our testing, and track and tracing system, into proper, reliable shape we should not be basing policy on it.Fears have surfaced of second nationwide coronavirus lockdown as officials warned the end of the year will be bumpy for Britain.The Sage advisory group said Britain’s reproduction number was between . and ., with senior sources warning “more nationwide measures” may be needed. A senior government source told The : We’re looking at a pretty bumpy autumn and winter and that’s going to go in the direction of increased cases and increased outbreaks.Another source added: “If it doesn’t get contained it may be that some things that have been open, you need to think about whether measures need to be taken to reverse things.Government scientists fear Britain could follow countries like Spain, Europe’s fastest rising caseload, with  cases per , people. The number of daily cases in the holiday hotspot have risen from  when lockdown eased on June  to more than ,.National figures showed that one person died from coronavirus today in England, as the UK confirmed , new cases.Emergency plans have been drawn up to protect the UK from the perfect storm of a winter second wave of Covid- coinciding with a No Deal Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A quarter of all goods tested showed levels of poisons including lead, arsenic and mercury, an investigation by campaign group Unchecked UK discovered. But with only half of councils were carrying out examinations, there are potentially thousands of hazardous goods in circulation, it warned. Unchecked UKaposs Emma Rose said: “Most people support strong rules on chemical safety. “They want to know the everyday products in their homes – like clothes, cosmetics and children’s toys – are free from toxic chemicals. “But our research shows that these protections are being undermined by poor enforcement as local public protection teams simply aren’t being given the resources they need – with potentially dangerous consequences.  “As we rebuild our communities after the pandemic, public bodies must be given adequate funding to fulfil their vital duties and close the enforcement gap our research has revealed.” Unchecked submitted freedom of information requests to all councils in England, Scotland and Wales, asking how many products were tested, what chemicals were discovered breaching safe limits, and the numbers of prosecutions launched. Of  local authorities which replied,  took no samples over the last three years. Of those that carried out tests, , products were analysed for hazardous chemicals. Some  – % – were found to have breached legal limits. The most common chemical discovered was hydroquinone, which is used in skin lightening treatments and was found in  samples. Where chemical breaches were identied, three-quarters of councils took no legal action. Experts blamed Tory cuts to local government, with a % plunge in funding from Whitehall since , for creating gaps in trading standardsapos regimes. Between  and , the number of local authority trading standards staff fell by %, from , to ,. Spending on trading standards by English councils plunged by %. National Consumer Federation chairman Arnold Pindar said: “Unchecked UK’s research gives further evidence that local public protection teams are seriously under-resourced, with too many hazardous consumer goods going untested and finding their way into our homes. “Not only is this a danger to the public, but the lack of enforcement also undermines the ability of businesses that meet regulations and provide safe products to compete in UK markets. “Public bodies need to be given adequate funding to fulfil their vital role in keeping our communities safe.” Shadow Business Minister Alan Whitehead said: This investigation has exposed that in taking away resources from local public protection teams, the Government has risked unsafe products making it to shop shelves and doing real harm. Over the past decade, local authorities have come under increasing pressures as the Tories have systematically stripped them of £billion of core government funding.“If the Government backtracks on its pledge to support councils in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, both the visible and more unseen consequences could be severe.Nesil Caliskan, of the Local Government Association, said: “Although it is ultimately the responsibility of manufacturers, suppliers and retailers to ensure the products they produce or sell comply fully with safety laws, councils work extremely hard to maintain and improve safety standards – despite severe budget pressures on their services.  “Trading standards budgets and staffing have been cut by around half since , which makes it extremely dficult for some councils to maintain previous inspection levels, given the competing demands of areas such as social care, children’s services and homelessness.” Chartered Trading Standards Institute chief executive Leon Livermore told the Mirror: “This highlights the fact that while the UK has reputable businesses, there are still issues and problems with unsafe products entering the market and itaposs important that government – both local and central – takes responsibility for that. “Its important that there is proper investment into protective professions, because the consequences of getting this wrong are risks to le and limb.

Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey called on ministers to finally award the £.billion contract for three Fleet Solid Support vessels to a British consortium. A Spanish-led team is bidding for the work to build the Royal Navy supply ships, which campaigners say will support , jobs. The battle comes as a major Whitehall defence and security review is underway. Mr Healey said: “For five years, defence ministers have dithered over this decision when it’s a no-brainer to build these vital new ships in Britain. “They are selling Britain short by not putting the work into UK shipyards.“No other major military nation has ordered naval support ships from foreign yards. “What can be built in Britain now, must be built in Britain – and long-term defence and security procurement must also involve plans to develop the UK’s future capacity to build in Britain. “This is one test by which we will judge the Government’s new integrated review of defence and security.” The ,-tonne vessels will resupply Royal Navy aircraft carriers, destroyers and frigates with food, ammunition and explosives.For national security reasons, Royal Navy warships can only be built in the UK. But because the supply ships will be part of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, they are not classed as warships – meaning they can be built abroad. Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions general secretary Ian Waddell said: “We very much welcome the aposBuilt in Britainapos test and believe it should be applied to every major industry project that is funded by the taxpayer in order to preserve our skills base and ability to design, build and maintain complex projects. “These ships are the cornerstone for the future of the British shipbuilding industry. “Placing the order in the UK will bridge the gap between the end of the aircraft carrier programme and the next tranche of ships on order which will provide highly-skilled employment for a generation in areas that need it most. “If the Prime Minister is serious about levelling up in the regions he will jump at the chance of building these ships in Britain as a straightforward means to pump investment into our regions and get the economy up and running again after the coronavirus lockdown. “Working people in our shipbuilding communities simply don’t understand why ministers are insisting on inviting foreign shipyards to tender. Community steelworkersapos union general secretary Roy Rickhuss said: “We know that steelworks in the UK have the capacity to produce the bulk of the materials needed for the proposed Fleet Solid Support ships.  “The Prime Minister promised that steel produced in the UK would be first in line in the planned ‘infrastructure revolution’. “Building these ships in Britain, and building them using Britain’s steel, is this Government’s opportunity to stand by their word and stand by our industry.” The competition for the contract was initially offered worldwide, with companies from Italy, Spain, Japan and South Korea shortlisted, along with a UK consortium. The British team, backed by the Keep Britain Afloat campaign, includes Babcock, BAE Systems, Cammell Laird and Rolls-Royce. The tendering process was halted suddenly in November – raising hopes the terms could be reset to boost British firmsapos chances of winning the deal. But earlier this month, the Ministry of Defence triggered fresh dismay when foreign firms were invited to take part in early plans to build them. The prior information notice says the deal is open to UK and international suppliers or consortiums offering a UK or international ship design, who are capable of either priming, providing a design and or integrating or building FSS ships. Four weeks previously, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace fuelled hopes the deal would go to a UK yard.

The winding down of the furlough scheme begins next month when companies become responsible for paying % of staffaposs wages and the Government cuts its contribution from % to %. Experts fear the move could accelerate redundancies. Labour published analysis showing the relatively high proportions of people working in ious industries around the county. The sector hardest hit by mass redundancies since the coronavirus pandemic struck has been retail, with manufacturing and aviation also badly impacted.Data uncovered by the party shows that more than % of the North West’s workforce is in the retail sector – the highest proportion anywhere in the UK. Wales and the North East are second and third in terms of the proportion of the workforce in retail. Almost % of the workforce in the East Midlands is in manufacturing – the highest proportion in the whole country. The West Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber, Wales, the North East and North West all have between % and % of their workforce in the manufacturing sector. In comparison, just .% of London’s workforce is in manufacturing. However, the capital could be hardest hit by damage to the aviation and travel industries. Some .% of its workforce is in the aviation industry, with , jobs relying on aviation and travel.  Shadow Business Minister Matthew Pennycook said: “Ministers are writing off parts of the UK as the country enters recession, with figures suggesting some places will be disproportionately impacted by the jobs crisis. “Labour is calling for the Government to U-turn on their damaging blanket approach to withdrawing furlough, which fails to consider the circumstances of dferent sectors nor the impact on the communities that have a proud history in these industries. “The Government needs to do right by these communities and businesses, and see them through the crisis by targeting support, not pull the le raft away while the storm is still raging on. With a disproportionate number of women and young people working in retail – the hardest-hit sector – the Governmentaposs approach also risks exacerbating inequalities already faced by these people too.

Not the PM’s cynical lying, not the arrogance and not the laziness – though these are all per­­ilous traits reinforcing his unsuitability for high office – but the grotesque ineptitude of a harmfully useless charlatan. This is the chancer who flies by the seat of his privileged pants, who demonstrated a frightening lack of concern for the aspirations of millions of children over testing. People who, foolishly, cut Johnson a bit of slack over sky-high virus death tolls and dire financial damage aren’t giving him the benefit of the doubt over the entirely avoidable BTEC, GCSE and A-level shambles. It’s why Starmer is now preferred to Johnson as PM in polls and, nine months after an election drubbing, the Labour Party has inched to within a couple of points of the Conservatives.One-time chief prosecutor Starmer is widely viewed as competent, while ex-magazine editor Johnson is seen as incompetent.Starmer successfully ran the hugely complex Crown Prosecution Service.Johnson was forced to apologise for mistakes at the Spectator, once dubbed The Sextator. Just as voters cared about the Back to Basics tawdry hypocrisy during John Major’s tortuous long goodbye in the s, Starmer is betting on people becoming fed up with Johnson’s stumbling in the s.

The denim perennial has been in production since  and is a favourite of Hollywood stars and manual workers alike. Second place went to the s-defining Mary Quant-style miniskirt, while Leviaposs denim jackets, UGG boots and Fred Perry polo shirts completed the top five. The poll of , UK adults saw Barbour wax jackets, Ray-Ban Wayfarers and Hunter wellies also feature on the list. Thomas Berry, director of sustainable business for Farfetch, which commissioned the study as part of its drive to raise awareness of sustainable fashion, said: Now more than ever, customers are interested in making considered purchases that will stand the test of time. From pre-owned denim to iconic designer pieces, customers are willing to seek out and to invest in pieces that are conscious, durable and also timeless, regardless of trends. Nearly a fth of those polled named Christian Louboutinaposs famous red-bottomed shoes as an iconic statement piece. Although in terms of memorability, the classy designer shoe only came one place above the gardeneraposs favourite - Crocs. It also emerged that at some point in their lives,  per cent of adults have owned a classic Ralph Lauren polo shirt, and one in six have worn some iconic Nike Air Max trainers.  Half of those polled would still wear any of these memorable trends from years gone by, and three in  have hunted in a charity shop or vintage store to find one specic piece of clothing. Many of the items in the list have been handed down to Brits, who didnapost quite realise what they had, as three in  got rid of items given to them by older relatives, only to regret it later. But just under six in adults now say theyaposd rather have fewer quality pieces in their wardrobe, than lots of cheap items which wouldnapost last as long.  The average adult spends about three hours, and £, a month in charity or vintage clothing stores, with a third actively enjoying aposthe huntapos of finding the perfect garment. More than one in  have even spent a DECADE or longer searching high and low for that one mythical item which will complete their wardrobe.And  per cent agree that fashion is cyclical, and what was once trendy will become trendy again in the future.Despite the desire for more long-lasting clothing, only eight per cent of Brits say they aposalwaysapos shop sustainably, although  per cent apossometimesapos manage to.# The research, conducted via OnePoll, also found  per cent have cut down on clothes shopping in general to reduce their carbon footprint, while  per cent buy from stores which have good green credentials. While a further four in  will be sure to clear space from their wardrobe by giving away old clothes, before buying anything new.Following the findings, Farfetch have created a aposfashion footprintapos tool which gives people the chance to consider the environmental impact of their shopping. Thomas Berry added: The tool allows consumers, when choosing to make a purchase, to consider which materials can reduce the environmental impact of their purchases, and to see the environmental savings of incorporating pre-owned products into their wardrobes. To remind people of the iconic items and test their knowledge, Farfetch have created the ultimate quiz for fashionistas to try out. The top  most iconic fashion items of all time . Leviaposs s .

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have already moved into into their plush £m home in Santa Barbra, Calornia, after leaving their friendaposs LA mansion last month. A spokesperson claimed the couple had settled into the quiet privacy of their community since moving with baby Archie in early July. The couple have reportedly been rubbing shoulders with celebrity neighbours such as Ellen DeGeneres and Oprah Winfrey. But Mark Karloff, who has photographed celebrities in LA for over a decade, says the couple are naive for thinking they can escape press intrusion.  He added that the paparazzi pack has already located their home and photographers are already waiting for the couple to venture outside.The Paparazzi Podcast host told Daily Star : Itaposll be the same thing, there will be photographers around town waiting for them.Because they are there to get other people as well, itaposs not just them up there. Ellen is a big story right now, she is living up there, Oprah is there all the time and a few other celebrities that are still there right now, like Orlando and Katie Perry. They come and go also. All I have seen or heard about is a couple of photographers found the mansion. Because everybody was wondering which one it was, there were a couple of photographers that actually found it. Not of Harry and Meghan, just of the property. I talked to a couple photographers, supposedly they are the ones that found it. And Karloff believes that continued press intrusion at their new mansion could even be a final straw. He continued: It could be a final straw, it could be, I just donapost think that they are too smart about what they are doing. Iaposve had conversations with celebrities, before I was even in the industry, on where they should move tothey donapost want to be seen,they want their privacy.  And there are places that these people can go, without being bothered too much, places that have multiple exits, places that are very private, but they are not around a group of other celebrities. It seems like they want to live next door to Oprah, they want to live next door next to Ellen, they want that hype of the place they live but that diminishes the privacy. Just move somewhere on their own, away from Hollywood, away from the celebrities, away from all this stuff, and they can live in privacy, or somewhat privacy.

Beverley Edwards, , of Chesham, Hertfordshire, arrived at Pontins Brean Sands on Monday after a three-hour drive with her partner, Vivian Alderton.

Have you suffered from a poor Pontins experience this summer  Email webnews@mirrorI ended up in a queue where I heard complaints from other customers about missing things like plates, glasses. Someone said their place had flooded and another said their bedding was wet. There were people stunned and with their mouths open hearing all the other stories people were saying at the reception.  Miss Edwards, who has mobility issues, was directed to her chalet and walked on a muddy footpath and through an overgrown tree to access it. Miss Edwards then pulled the door open and was left shocked by the state of her absolutely filthy accommodation. She said: There was an overpowering smell of mould and a sour and dirty odour which filled the room. It was so tiny. There were damaged chairs stacked and a table with a filthy base.  To the left of the door was a broom with hairs and mess appearing to be there while cleaning being done. But clearly cleaning hadnapost been done. There was dust, dirt, cobwebs and lumps of unidentied stuff around. The plastic settee bed had stains on it. Along with her problems, she encountered mouldy curtains, a stained cooker top and oven, with dead flies inside the ceiling light and around the chalet. She saw she found unidentied items which she feared were stains or tobacco in the draws, kettle and wardrobe.  Miss Edwards added: Inside the bedroom, there were two single beds. One had a plastic coating and the other looked older than I am and had stains. The bedding provided looked cheap and unhealthy. I didnapost touch or smell it and did not want to sleep in it. Miss Edwards was also left unsettled by the thumping music, people shouting and could smell people smoking in the nearby area.She was also concerned about hygiene and lack of guests wearing masks at the resort during the coronavirus pandemic - a time where resorts are undertaking more cleaning to curb any spread of Covid-. Unhappy with the state of her chalet, she ed to the reception and patiently complained about the issues she encountered to a manager. Miss Edwards was offered a deep clean of her chalet but after overhearing a long wait for cleaners and other customers reportedly asking for their rooms to be cleaned, she declined the offer. She said: I could not wait in that accommodation and wait for someone to come to clean the room. It was not nice and I felt quite uncomfortable. I refused a deep clean due to the wait.

Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by financier Jeffrey Epstein, alleges Prince Andrew had sex with her on three separate occasions - including when she was , still a minor under US law. This morning she claimed she was gted to the royal, and voiced her fury on Twitter. She wrote: All the evidence you could poke a stick out and yet the justice system defends a known predator who just happens to be a prince, anyone  would be thrown into jail. He knew I had no choice- he knew I was being trafficked- gted to him. Nothings all right. Running out of hope.  Ms Giuffre, who was pictured with the Duke of York in London in London, has previously said she hopes Andrew is put “in a cell next to his best mate” Ghislaine Maxwell. The former teen ‘sex slave’ of Jeffrey Epstein spoke out after the chief of the politan Police offered to assist US authorities with their investigation into the US paedophile. Dame Cressida Dick said that while the focus of the FBI probe was “clearly” in America, she added the Met would assist US authorities should it be required “at any stage”. The help could include looking at Andrew’s ties to his friends Epstein and Maxwell.Prosecutors in the States claim they have been stonewalled by requests to interview Andrew, , with one prosecutor saying in January the Prince has provided “zero cooperation”. The Duke’s legal team hit back saying they had repeatedly offered his assistance but had been ignored. He categorically denies he had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Ms Giuffre.

According to a royal source the -year-old monarch will not reside at Buckingham Palace but would like to commute to the capitalit is safe to do so.It is believed that this will be the longest absence the Queen has had from Buckingham Palace during her -year reign, the Sunday Times reports.The Queen usually s to London in October after enjoying her annual summer break in Balmoral, but instead, she will reportedlyto Windsor Castle. Both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have been self-isolating at Windsor since March  - four days before the UK went into lockdown. She has reportedly been told that the close-knit bubble of household staff who have been working with her in Windsor is the safest way to reduce the risk of her contracting coronavirus. A royal source said: There is a desire to get Buckingham Palace up and running again as a working palace, but onlyall the relevant advice suggests that it is appropriate to do so. It is believed that plans are being drawn up so the Queen can safely attend commemorations at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in November.But until the threat of coronavirus is eliminated the Queen will not apparentlyto Buckingham Palace. However, it is thought that she will spend her Christmas break at Sandringham in Norfolk as usual. The news comes after reports that the coronavirus risk means the Queen may not be allowed toto her public duties for years to come.Royal biographer Andrew Morton, , told The Sun in May that he feared the Queen may only be seen on TV or video links rather than in public due to the risk to herself and Prince Philip.The writer, who penned Diana: Her True Story in , told the paper: Itaposs terribly sad but I canapost see how the Queen can resume her usual job. The Covid- virus isnapost going away soon and will be with us for months,not years.  It would be far too risky for the Queen to start meeting people on a regular basis. The stringent measures are expected to upset The Queen as she has said in the past that she has to be seen to be believed. Buckingham Palace is usually open to the public for  weeks each summer and selected dates during winter and spring. But due to the coronavirus pandemic it has remained closed to visitors after a decision made by the Royal Collection Trust last month because of the operational challenges of social distancing in their palaces and properties.

Pupils have already missed out on schooling because of the lockdown and risk falling behind still furtherthe disruption continues. The Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, speaks sense when he says children are more likely to be harmed by not attending school than from catching coronavirus. What is missing is not the will but the reassurance. Parents and teachers need to know that every effort has been made to make sure pupils and staff are safe. They also want clarication on what will happenthere is a further spike in infections. This requires leadership. Unfortunately, we have been lumbered with one of the worst Education Secretaries ever to hold the post.Few have confidence in Gavin Williamson, especially now we know he took a jaunt to the seaside at the height of the exams fiasco. If we want our kids back in the classroom we need a clear plan that works for parents, teachers and pupils.  Don’t sink us Labour is right to demand the new fleet of Navy support vessels is built in Britain. Given the £.billion order will support , jobs it is incomprehensible the Government is considering handing the contract overseas. Furthermore, these ships should be built using British steelpossible. One benefit of Brexit is the UK will no longer be bound by EU procurement rules that mean any country in the bloc can bid for tenders.

An anonymous woman received a message on Instagram from a man who conducted her blood test at the hospital just a few days prior. It read: Hey, this might seem a bit odd but I done your blood test the other day at hospital, and I thought you were good looking and seemed nice so here I am shooting my shot. Shocked by the unexpected message she took to Twitter to say: Hello HR is that you. But she probably didnapost receive the response she expected as users accused her of putting the manaposs job as risk. Despite the fact that the doctor had gone against patient confidentiality rules, many Twitter users thought she overreacted. Since being posted the tweet has received , likes and , comments. One person said: I don’t think it’s right but also don’t think it’s worth getting him sacked over. You need to put him straight tho and say you could report him for it and he needs to think about how much he values his job. Guy needs a reality check not complete destruction of his future.

It later received the response: Iaposm an HR Manager. To go through a patientaposs record to get their full name, then track them down on social media to hit on them, especially while referencing his job with the hospital, would absolutely, and rightfully, result in termination. But a few people agreed the doctor was creepy. One said: His behaviour has crossed multiple boundaries professionally and personally. Donapost be gaslit into thinking him possibly losing his job would be your fault - itaposs entirety on him. All of this is on him for choosing to act this way. He deserves to be reported. And another added: It’s not your job to tell him, to teach him anything. Andyou complained about him any action taken by the hospital would not your fault, it would be his. Women are not responsible for men, men are. A third also agreed: Too many people take the weight of their complaint on their shoulders.

Each year Brits make up seven million of the Spanish resort’s . million tourists – until the pandemic hit trade. Last month travellers to the UK from Spain were told they would have to self-isolate for  days. Jose Maria Caballe, Benidorm’s biggest hotelier, believes the town must ditch its cheap and cheerful image after the current health crisis. He said: “We can’t cater for low-level clientele to get drunk for three days. This doesn’t happen in a modern country. “Benidorm has to change because the costs are going up and hotels can’t work with such low prices. “The pandemic has been like a decisive punch to a boxer already on the ropes. The popular market will neverto the same level. When the market recovers there will be demand for more quality.” Mr Caballe, who owns  hotels, said the town’s future held lessons for tourism in Spain, which brings in % of the nation’s GDP. He said: “During the s, s and s the standard of living in Spain was very low. People put up with noise and ­drunkenness because they needed to.” "},{"url":null,"title":"horrific clip shows whale meat","story":"NewsHorric clip shows whale meat dumped in ocean after five butchered in huntWARNING: DISTRESSING CONTENT Activists have hit out at the traditional \"blood sport\" hunt in the Faroe Islands, which sees hundreds of whales hacked to death each yearShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video horric-moment-truck-dumps-unwanted-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

A clip released by activists seemingly shows the aftermath of five northern bottlenose whales being butchered this week. Each year animals are surrounded as they migrate past the shores of the Danish territory and herded toward the beach, where they are hacked to death. It has been described as an insane blood sport by charity ORCA, which is lobbying to end the slaughter, carried out with knives by licensed hunters. The meat and bones are seen being emptied from a truck down clfs which are already red with blood. Captain Paul Watson, who founded rights group Sea Shepherd, told Yahoo News Australia : “What they do is they kill everything. They take what they need, andthey donapost need it, they throw it away. He said unwanted meat gets thrown over the clfs into the ocean, adding: “We’ve documented where the bodies have been weighted down and sank to the bottom, so it’s like a... graveyard down there.” Around , pilot whales swim close to the Faroe Islands, located in the North Atlantic between Norway and Iceland and comprising of  tiny islands, each year. Sea Shepherd show hunters in the water butchering the whales. It has described the hunts as a barbaric. The Faroese hunt on average  whales annually. All hunters must have a hunting license. The Blue Planet Society has condemned the tradition and said the animals had been brutally and cruelly slaughtered.

I like what Olly Crankshaw brought to the Dee last term and a similar sort should be sought.At the back, a left-sider to push Jordan Marshall and a goalkeeper should be on the shopping list, while a No  to bang in the goals is needed.The clock has started ticking, let’s see what the next month and a half brings. . .Enjoying the privileged position of being able to attend games in person this season has been fantastic but minus fans it’s lacked something.Whether it’s passionate Dees banging on the Tannadice press box window celebrating a derby equaliser or hordes of Arabs heading for away days in the sun, they’ve been missed.It’s certainly earlier than expected but the September  date is promising. Fingers crossed it happens!There’s just no seeing past Bayern Munich for the Champions League is there  The Germans are an absolute powerhouse and, as good as PSG are, I don’t think they stand a chance in the Lisbon finale tomorrow.Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretWyaDSfYoJ\" data-secret\"WyaDSfYoJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Football with fans is what it’s all about.“It will be terric to get supporters back and I am really looking forward to getting back to having them in the stadium backing us.“Common sense will tell you that in order for football clubs to grow you need finances and part of that is getting fans through the door.“So I would imagine it will have a positive impact on that front but, as a manager, it’s about having that backing from the stands.”With impeccable timing, Mellon revealed he himself had been unable to attend a game – Tuesday’s Champions League qualying tie between the Hoops and KR Reykjavik at Celtic Park on Tuesday night.He wanted to see Neil Lennon’s men in the flesh ahead of their league clash but Mellon explained: “We tried to get into the Celtic game but we couldn’t get tickets.“Celtic told us Uefa are not allowing anyone in to watch the games.“But with the technology you have now we have been able to watch all the games they have had recently.”Mellon witnessed, albeit virtually, that - thrashing of the Icelandic team and knows this is the greatest challenge his players will have faced since stepping up from the Championship.He said: “Whenever you play the champions in any country you know the challenge will be a big one.“But it is something you want to be involved in and get excited about.“We will be encouraging the players to get involved in all games so this is an opportunity to play in a fantastic game against the champions.“It is all positive because it gives us a chance to see where we are as a club and go attack it.“We believe we can make a positive impact – that is what we are in the Premiership for.“Given the size of this football club, that is what we should we doing. That is what the fans and the owners of the club expect.”The Tangerines have impressed in the way they have nullied threats from their opponents thus far, with Motherwell and Hibs in particular struggling to make headway against a solid midfield.This test is on another level but Mellon said: “We will be trying to find a way to make it dficult for Celtic. Every team has strengths and weaknesses, so we have to get an awful lot right on the day to get a result against Celtic.“But this is football and you always have a chance.”Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretJTZmAXcxG\" data-secret\"JTZmAXcxG\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Every day the lockdown continued # necessary though that was # damaged local businesses, jobs, and Aberdeen#s economy.#The commitment of people in Aberdeen to sticking to the local lockdown rules and the hard work of NHS staff has driven down the Coronavirus infection rate to a point where it is now possible to end the local lockdown.#Every single person and business in Aberdeen must continue to stick to all the rules and guidelines to minimise the risk of a further Coronavirus outbreak in Aberdeen.

defeat of St Johnstone, was also available.Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes made five changes to the side which won - in Perth on Thursday.Alongside new signing Watkins, the other changes to the starting line-up were the addition of Shay Logan, Ryan Hedges, Matty Kennedy and Scott McKenna.Hedges was elevated to the first , having came off the bench to score the winner against Saints.Kennedy and McKenna, both part of the Aberdeen eight who broke coronavirus protocol by visiting a busy city centre-bar on August  following a - loss to Rangers, both ed.Kennedy had been a used substitute in the defeat of St Johnstone.Livingston created the first opportunity in the seventh minute when Allan Forrest was played clean through on goal.However, just as he was about to shoot inside the goal Logan slid in to dispossess him with a perfectly timed tackle.In the th minute, a -yard drive from Jonny Hayes was deflected off Nicky Devlin and spun wide of the far post for a corner.Aberdeen threatened again in the th minute following good work from Matty Kennedy down the left flank.He burst past Nicky Devlin then fired in a low cross along the face of goal that found Lewis Ferguson.Shooting low on the turn, the midfielder#s -yard effort was straight at keeper Robby McCrorie, the twin brother of recent Dons signing Ross.Keeper Joe Lewis came to the rescue in the th minute with a vital block to deny Scott Robinson that came from Kennedy#s poor touch.Robinson collected a pass from Devlin and shot low, but Lewis spread himself to block the shot with his left leg.The loose ball fell to Craig Sibbald, whose effort was deflected wide.Aberdeen went ahead in the th minute when Ferguson was brought down in the penalty area by Sibbald as he tried to control a cross from Kennedy.Referee Steven McLean awarded a penalty which FERGUSON rled into the keeper#s top-left corner.Aberdeen doubled their advantage with a superbly worked goal when Scott WRIGHT played a neat one-two with Ryan Hedges which ripped apart the Livi defence.Hedges# cushioned touch picked out WRIGHT and he matched that impressive delivery with an outstanding right-footed finish.New loan signing Watkins was denied a debut goal by two quick-fire saves from Livi keeper McCrorie in the th minute.First Watkins latched onto a cross from Funso Ojo, but his shot from the centre of the box was saved by McCrorie.Within a minute, Watkins met a Hayes cross at the back post and his powerful header from close range was again superbly blocked by the keeper.Livingston hit back in the th minute when Jack Fitzwater burst past Kennedy and Hayes on the flank to fire a low cross along the face of goal.He should never have been allowed to deliver the cross, and Scott PITTMAN punished the slack defending by shooting home from five yards.ABERDEEN: Joe Lewis, Shay Logan, Ash Taylor, Scott McKenna, Jonny Hayes, Ross McCrorie, Lewis Ferguson, Scott Wright, Ryan Hedges, Matty Kennedy, Marley Watkins.Subs: Funso Ojo , Dylan McGeouch , Connor McLennan , Curtis Main , Tommie Hoban Subs not used: Tomas Cerny, Ronald Hernandez,  Bruce Anderson.LIVINGSTON: McCrorie, Devlin, Fitzwater, Guthrie, McMillan, Forrest, Bartley, Pittman, Sibbald, Holt, Robinson.Subs: Ambrose , Hamilton , Serrano , Tfoney Subs not used: Stryjek, Taylor-Sinclair,  Crawford, Kouider-Aissa.Referee: Steven McLeanFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % -

Sadly, we must now take the dficult decision to postpone this year#s showcase.He added: #With fingers and drumsticks firmly crossed, we are rescheduling MOJO for spring  on a soon-to-be-announced date.#With this in mind, we are also extending our deadline for demo submissions to December , after which we will announce the new event line-up.#Dan continued: #As ever, we extend our thanks to all our volunteers, friends and fans for their help, support and appreciation of our pure original live musicians # you guys are the best crowd ever.#We also send out to all our past, present and future performers a huge cheer for all the magic moments, entertainment and inspiration they give us.Please please keep your creative MOJO flowing # we can#t wait to hear you blow us away again.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

The village#s fire engine was used to demonstrate to the youngsters how dficult they are to see from the cab of a large goods vehicle, particularly to the rear and near side at junctions.They also learned about primary and secondary road positions, right of way and good observational skills.They were even encouraged to ask their parentsthey do the #Dutch Reach# to keep passing cyclists safe. The Dutch Reach is a simple change of habit to help you open your car door safely. Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges. P  pupils Ross Potter-Irwin and Henry Small should get their Bikeability badges in term time next year.Through partnership with the Ardrishaig Bothy, Cycling Scotland is offering schools free instructor support, instructor training and resources to deliver Bikeability Scotland training.Bikeability Scotland is the national cycle training programme designed to give children the skills and confidence they need to cycle safely on the roads and to encourage them to carry on cycling into adulthood.

Control system builders ITI will undertake the design, installation and commissioning of the upgrade across the station’s four units.The power station, constructed in a cavern within Ben Cruachan on the shores of Loch Awe, plays a critical role in stabilising the country’s electricity system throughout the Covid- pandemic due to its flexibility. The plant can generate power in less than a minute when needed and can also store excess electricity from the grid like a giant battery, a service which was called upon when the low electricity demand during the lockdown coincided with periods of high wind power in Scotland.The plant’s reversible turbines pump water from Loch Awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid. The stored water is then released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases."},{"url":null,"title":"huge-asset-borders-closed","story":"THE Girl Guide movement in Scotland has been left ldquoheartbroken after it was announced this week that its Borders-based activity centre would shut for good.The closure of Netherurd House near Blyth Bridge is said to be due to financial dficulty, with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic being the final nail in the coffin.Staff will be made redundant, with the exception of the groundskeeper who will be retained until the estate is sold.Margot Swanston, who has visited Netherurd for  years as a guide and leader, described herself as ldquodevastated.The stunning Georgian mansion and its extensive grounds have served thousands of guides and brownies for more than  years.After finances plummeted five years ago, a review was carried out which resulted in signicant investment to improve facilities and make it more attractive for users.There was an initial increase in bookings, but over the last three years numbers dropped, resulting in fewer users and financial woes.Girlguiding Scotlandrsquos chief commissioner Moira McKenna said: ldquoIn the past, we regularly used to fill the house with adults for county and other training weekends, but this has been declining for at least the last decade.ldquoFewer counties book for training, more of them come for only one night and the numbers from each county are lower than in previous times.ldquoThere is now much more training available online and this has increased dramatically this year with COVID-.ldquoEven before the pandemic came along, Girlguiding was planning to set up a digital hub to provide training online, and whilst we know the value of being together, volunteers across Scotland are finding the online or local training options more convenient in terms of both time and money.ldquoWe had hoped to build external business for mid-week, especially schools, but we were unable to build a wide enough business base to rely on this.ldquoEach year we have tried other avenues including holidays for Trefoil groups, retreats for local churches, private family gatherings and occasional weddings, but overall we could not generate enough routine business to help us improve the finances.ldquoThis was the situation before we were forced to close Netherurd in March due to COVID-, and since then the centre has had no income.A spokesperson for Netherurd House added: ldquoWe want to take this opportunity to say a huge thank you to all the staff and volunteers who have made Netherurd a place of adventure and provided ever-lasting memories for so many girls and young people.ldquoThis is a signicant loss to Girlguiding Scotland and we know many will be upset by this news.ldquoOur priority remains our members and wersquore committed to ensuring that girls and young women can keep having adventure and benefit from all that the outdoors has to offer.Former visitors to Netherurd House took to social media calling the closure a ldquosad day for Girlguiding Scotland.,params: .pushOne woman wrote: ldquoDreadful news.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"young-people-scotland-can-get-250-free-starting-new-job","story":"Young people across Scotland could be in line for as much as pound free from the Government for starting a new job, thanks to a new benefit.Its hoped the payment, which is open for applications from today, will help young people with the financial dficulties of starting a new job - including buying new clothes, travel and get childcare.It is estimated around  young people will benefit from the new financial support in its first year.What is the benefit The Job Start Payment is a one-off sum of pound for  to -year-oldsthey have been unemployed for at least six months.The upper age limit rises to  for care leavers and the payment increases to poundthe person has a child.How can I qualy for the payment To qualy for the payment, which will be delivered by Social Security Scotland, the person applying must have received a job offer for paid employment.They must be out of paid work and must have been receiving one of the qualying benefits for six months or more at the time of the job offer:Income-based Jobseekerrsquos AllowanceIncome SupportIncome-related Employment and Support AllowanceUniversal CreditWhat has the Scottish Government said Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoI am delighted that our Job Start Payment is today now open for applications it really couldnrsquot come at a better time to support our young people to take up job offers.ldquoYoung people are among those whose job prospects have been hardest hit by this pandemic.

Itrsquos not so easy to access, but the fact the trees are now under threat made me want to discover the place before it might be too late. As I write, the decision has yet to be made on the fate of the trees.Irsquom a lover of history and totally understand the need to create a safe, weather-proof home for these historic planes, and to keep the museum as much an authentic visiting experience as possible. But there is a huge amount of space in the existing museum area, so the destruction of woodland seems unnecessary.The museum argues that any additional modern structures near the runway will undermine the historic look of the airfield. The proposed new visitor centre will, they say, create much-needed new jobs. So cutting down the trees to move the planes and create a new home for them is, the museum authorities argue, the only realistic option for them. They say that refusal of their plans will put the new jobs at risk.I totally understand the need for jobs at this time in particular, but the trouble is the approach taken by the museum is part of the reason the world is facing an ecological crisis with deforestation, the destruction of habitats and the extinction of wildle. It is part of the mindset that sees nature as ldquoin the way of development.Donrsquot be ridiculously dramatic, I hear some folks say this is not the Amazon or a rainforest in Indonesia, itrsquos a small wood in East Lothian.And that is precisely the point. It is a small but very rare example of a wood with mature trees in our county. It is a special place, with a ersity of trees and buzzing with wildle. Walk under its canopy and you will discover that. I know itrsquos proposed to plant new trees in a dferent area as compensation, but this wonrsquot connect to the wood and will take generations to grow. It will never replace what will be lost.If we seriously want to do something about the ecological disaster we are making on our planet then we need to start in our own backyard. We canrsquot campaign against deforestation, habitat destruction and declare a climate emergency, and then say: ldquoWell, the rules donrsquot apply to us when we want to destroy woodland to move some planes.Deforestation has a multitude of justications all over the world: dam building, road construction, cattle ranching, extreme poverty of subsistence farmers, profit from timber, oil exploration and pipelines, mining: the list is long. The point is there will always be someone with an economic justication for environmental destruction.While it may be on a much smaller scale, the proposal to destroy irreplaceable woodland in order to move some planes is a product of the same mindset that has brought us to a point of environmental and climate crisis.This mindset is revealed in the Historic Environment Scotland response to the proposal. This is the public body charged with protecting Scotlandrsquos built heritage. It has said: ldquoWe would not consider the trees of Sunnyside Strip to be directly related to the cultural signicance of the scheduled monument ndash they are visible but do not relate to our understanding of the monument as a wartime airfield.In other words, woodland isnrsquot part of our heritage mature trees, many of which were around before the war, arenrsquot historic or worthy of value in themselves. Really The wood is far more a historic part of the wartime airfield site than the massive car park. It seems to be a very selective viewpoint.The truth is that the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries on the planet. A quarter of our already-decimated wild mammals are in danger of extinction. Our woodlands are small and dispersed, but all the more vital for the habitat they provide. East Lothian has huge developmental pressure, and this wood is a rare and vital part of naturersquos increasingly precarious foothold in our county.A changed mindset would be one which makes the protection of nature and the environment the initial default position. Developers should then take this priority as the starting point for proposals.That hasnrsquot happened with this plan, and credit to the council for rejecting it.There has been so much publicity and justied outrage recently over the destruction and littering of our land by people lsquowildrsquo camping and disrespecting nature. So many people, it seems, just donrsquot care, or seem unable to appreciate the gt of our natural environment and its importance.There is a disconnect from nature at the heart of this. We will never solve the environmental and climate crisis we are in until we can foster love and appreciation of nature, of which we are a part. Our childrenrsquos future literally depends on this.And institutions such as National Museums Scotland should be part of the solution, not the problem. Instead of viewing the woodland as irrelevant to the visitor experience, it could be used to enhance it. The wood is a magic place, with younger trees growing amidst towering old mature ones.My kids were in wonder as they explored the wood, peering up at the tops of the trees, and an old oak caught their attention as its boughs seemed to dip asto say hello. We spent a wonderful hour being immersed in nature.Many of our children, in fact many adults, have limited opportunities to explore and enjoy such places. Imagine the extra possibility of a nature walk in the tall wood, where wildle thrives and trees older than the airfield can tell their story. This wood is not an intrusion for the visitor but a potential wonderful addition. Get the ranger service to do talks and tours about this amazing place, a treasure hunt use it to enhance peoplersquos connection to nature ndash an extra experience.Woodland is not just a habitat for wildle, itrsquos a habitat for us humans too. Enjoying nature and learning about its importance should not be seen as a contradiction to enjoying historic planes.While Irsquom aware that itrsquos only part of the wood under threat, the proposal to destroy a large section of it will result in a tragic loss of trees and the habitat they provide. But itrsquos not just the destruction in itself, itrsquos also the precedent and example it sets for future developments.I really hope the Reporter will uphold the councilrsquos decision, and the museum, which is a fantastic and well-loved historic place to visit, will consider a new location for the visitor centre. Then we will all be winners."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-august-18-20-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoENOUGH is enoughrsquo was the message from traders in North Berwick, reported the East Lothian Courier on August , .The opening of North Berwickrsquos sixth charity shop this week has sparked controversy ndash and fears have been raised that a seventh could be on the cards.Traders claimed the resort had now reached ldquosaturation point with fundraising outlets, which are now selling new goods in addition to second-hand items.They said the charities were setting up shop on prime sites, and argued that they were ldquosubsidising them through having to pay higher rates.Fears that the trend could ultimately lead to a downturn in the local economy and the death of the High Street as a shopping centre were also expressed.The row follows the opening of the Chest, Heart  Stroke Associationrsquos outlet at a former delicatessen shop in the High Street on Monday.A RE-ENACTMENT of the Battle of Dunbar was postponed as it clashed with a model power boat demonstration, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of August , .The re-enactment of the Battle of Dunbar, which is to be staged by the Royal Scots as part of their recruiting drive in East Lothian, has been postponed for a week because it would have clashed with the running of a model power boat demonstration to be held on Sunday, September .

This is how I heard about an otter at the Esk for the first time three years ago.A few people mentioned they had seen this elusive creature a few years ago, but never since.The otter became my new photography challenge. I tried visiting the river at dferent times of the day, especially at dawn and dusk, when otters are more active, always trying to keep the noise down to a minimum.After two years of searching, my hope was gone and I almost gave up. Until one sunny day in April during lockdownhellipThe weather that day was enjoyable, so Chris and I decided to go on a walk. The local path was very busy the dog walkers, cyclists, families with children and joggers were enjoying the sun whilst social distancing.As always, I kept my eyes low on the water hoping to see the kingfisher.As we followed the river upstream to the area at The Grove, I spotted something moving in the water.I grabbed Chrisrsquo hand and I pulled him down on the ground right behind a bush.It was not a kingfisher but something I did not expect to see in the middle of the day... an otter fishing!We managed to crawl down the slope and lie down so we would not disturbit.Whilst I was photographing the otter, I also heard a cheery pee-pee-pee and saw the kingfisher flying past the otter. What a day!Since then I have seen the otter a couple more times.The Eurasian otter is a secretive, semi-aquatic species with chocolate brown fur, webbed feet, and a powerful tail. Their thick coats are built of two layers of fur: an inner layer that works as insulation, and the outer, waterproof layer. The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo. The size of their territory ies and depends on the quality of the habitat, amount of food and number of possible holts.It is also known that a male otter has a larger territory that can even overlap several female ottersrsquo territories. Otters usually have a well-defined area within their grounds in which they feed, rest and breed.Seeing signs of otters is generally easier than seeing the animals themselves. If you happen to find yourself at the riverbank or a sea loch, look for five-toed footprints and otter droppings , that are left in places such as fallen trees, rocks and weirs.Spraints are easily identiable as they contain visible fish bones and have a characteristic and not particularly unpleasant smell that has been described as ranging from fish to freshly brewed jasmine tea!The otter that you may see at the coast is very often called a lsquosea otterrsquo however, this is the same species as the animals that live further inland.If you would like to share how you get on finding the otters oryou have any rare kind of wildle in your area, I would love to hear from you.Speak to you next month!zanslensfacebook zanslens instagram zans_lens twitter zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"tantallon-castle-john-muir-birthplace-among-attractions-reopening","story":"Historic Environment Scotlandhas confirmed that Tantallon Castle, east of North Berwick, will accept visitors with pre-booked tickets from next Friday .A phased reopening of some HES sites across the county has begun, but there is no date yet for when Dirleton Castle could reopen.Both of these county attractions closed in March when lockdown was initiated to combat the coronavirus pandemic.A statement from HES said: ldquoAfter what has felt like historyrsquos longest wait, the easing of certain lockdown restrictions means you and your family can now grab a well-earned change of scenery at a selection of our safe and secure sites.ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to welcome you back and we would like to thank you for your patience and perseverance in staying home during this pandemic.ldquoWhen you arrive at any of our reopening sites, wersquoll need to work together to make sure we are all following the rules and staying protected.Entry tickets for Tantallon Castle can now be pre-booked via the website historicenviron ment.scotWalk-up visitors without an advanced booking will not be able to gain entry.Meanwhile, in another boost for the countyrsquos residents and visitors, the museum telling the story of Dunbarrsquos most famous son has reopened its doors.The John Muir Birthplace Museum welcomed back visitors on Tuesday for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak started.The museum, on the townrsquos High Street, allows visitors to explore the le and legacy of the man recognised as the father of the US national park system, in the house where he was born.Meanwhile, further attractions are also available for visitors to see at the National Museum of Flight, East Fortune.Hangar had already been open, along with the historic airfield and the parachute store.Now, the military aviation and civil aviation hangars have also opened to the public.Lucy Casot, CEO of Museums Galleries Scotland, said: ldquoWith so many of our museums and galleries across Scotland now able to open, therersquos so much to choose from, many with wonderful outdoor spaces to enjoy with the whole family.ldquoItrsquos not just a fun day out museums and galleries have a positive impact on our social wellbeing as well as the local economy, so we are urging everyone to make a point of visiting their favourite museum or gallery.ldquoAdditionally, with many of us staycationing this year, it is a wonderful opportunity to discover more of Scotlandrsquos inspiring museums and galleries."},{"url":null,"title":"retired-musselburgh-nurse-writes-book-caring-people-dementia","story":"Dee Jenkins, , of Eskmills Road, said the main aim of the publication ndash I Remember Dementia ndash was to encourage carers of dementia patients.Born in Dublin in , Mrs Jenkins, who has lived in Musselburgh for  years, came to Scotland in  to enter a religious order, the Novitiate for the Sisters of La Sagesse, at Leuchie House, North Berwick.

It rains there, too, and the thinking is as wild as in any war poem. Summerwater is lighter on its feet but no less anxious than Mossrsquos  masterpiece Ghost Wall. Good stories grow anywhere and these characters are cooped up in their cabins, wary of their neighbours and awkward with themselves.Do holidays imply peace of mind  Well. Summerwater begins with Justine, who runs early in the morning while the rest of her family are still asleep. At the start of the book shersquos considering where to go. If she runs as long as she wants to, she might have to snack later, andshe snacks the children will want to do the same. Then she remembers:ldquoShes got four protein bars tucked into her packet of sanitary towels in the suitcase, the only place no one  is likely to look, and shes not too proud to eat them in the bathroomshe has to.Its an aside but, in this book, nothing feels like an aside. This is a subtle but signicant scene in which Moss takes us into her confidence. When it comes to the workings of the secret heart, and the exchange between mind and body, this is a writer with few equals .Here we have the normalcy and lunacy of Brits on holiday. When Claire gets an hour to herself, she tries to lick the hair on her nipples. There is Milly who, in the build up to Project Simultaneous Orgasms, wonders about bread for sandwiches. Quite a feat, when you think of it, to be even considering sex in a Scottish cabin park in the rain. David, a retired doctor, knows the road by the loch as well as he knows the human body. And Moss is just as good on the body - childbirth, say - as she is on teenagers, or slugs. Though shersquos quite superb on slugs: ldquoThings shouldnrsquot be made like thathellipSpores drt up from the pages and you start to feel another presence entirely: alongside holidaymakers in repose - and distress - are short chapters told from inside an anthill, or from the point of view of a doe. Then these spectral fears dissolve into a characterrsquos annoyance with the crust on a baking tray.Not until rather late in the day does something happen to disturb this equilibrium. There hasnrsquot seemed to be any plan. But there is always a plan and, by now, Moss has done all the work she needs to do. This a writer in whose gts we trust, and she pulls off feat after feat of daring and empathy and wisdom.Justine, whose thoughts on running might be mistaken for Mossrsquo own considerations on the writing process, completes marathons in private. And Mossrsquos sentences run on too. You hear them long after you read them thought and feeling dissolving with animal grace. And, even as you delight in them, her paragraphs swing off and away - bound for the horizon  - only to be found by the side of the road, bent double, not in exhaustion but in the study of an object in close quarters, just as we do when we remember whatrsquos so revelatory about Scotland in the rain."},{"url":null,"title":"agenda-looking-power-culture-change-lives","story":"THE Edinburgh International Culture Summit is a distinctive event in an exceptional city. Established in  and supported by a unique partnership between the British Council, the Edinburgh International Festival, the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish and UK Governments, it traditionally offers a biennial ministerial forum in which artists and cultural leaders come together with politicians and policy makers to discuss substantial, global issues of mutual interest during the largest annual celebration of the arts in the world ndash the Edinburgh Festivals.The Covid- pandemic prevents hosting the summit at the Scottish Parliament this year. However, the resulting move to a Special Edition entirely online gives us a dferent opportunity, a way to make the Culture Summit even more accessible and available to everyone, be they in business, policy making, politics, economy, the arts, or simply curious. Neither geography nor means is a barrier, all films are freely available on the Culture Summit site from today.In our present circumstances, the summitrsquos title ,The Transformational Power of Culture, seems particularly appropriate. In the midst of a devastating pandemic, governments and cultural leaders alike grapple with unprecedented challenges attempting to save lives and sustain careers. At such times, it is important that a summit such as this, should develop a narrative around the signicance of culture for other facets of human societies.The summitrsquos collaborators in  are actors, theatre directors, choreographers, novelists, librarians, painters, museum curators, musicians and singers. They are also architects, economists, educators, epidemiologists, historians, human rights advocates, medical and social scientists, philanthropists, philosophers and tech entrepreneurs.Very much in this spirit, and by way of an example, when considering an approach to one of our themes, Culture  Education, the summit has chosen to collaborate not only with some amazing young musicians who are part of youth orchestras in Los Angeles and Raploch here in Scotland, but quite deliberately with an economist, an epidemiologist, a neuroscientist and an educational entrepreneur cum philanthropist.This eclectic group of expertise has been enlisted to make the case for why culture matters, and why, from the perspective of health and well-being, economic prosperity, and most important of all, from an humanitarian point of view, it is so vital that culture and creativity together with the encouragement of empathy and emotional intelligence, should play a far greater role in our schools and classrooms.Many of the perspectives of our contributors remind me of the work of the pioneering educational psychologist Howard Gardner, who in , first proposed the concept of multiple intelligence not just linguistic and logical , but spatial, bodily-kinaesthetic, musical, interpersonal and intrapersonal forms of intelligence demonstrated by architects and sculptors, dancers and choreographers, athletes and gymnasts, business leaders, scientists and even politicians.Courtesy of Professor Gardner, the definitions of intelligence become vastly expanded. He argues persuasively that intelligence is not single-minded but multi-faceted. He describes the need for ldquomultiple intelligences to navigate the complex challenges of the world around us.The message for policy makers and politicians is urgent. Beyond the need for hope and inspiration in the lives of young people, there is an emerging body of knowledge from economists to neuroscientists which advocates for educational systems to place far greater emphasis on cultural learning opportunities and creativity from early childhood.Join us in embracing a world of creative potential, demonstrating the critical need for greater recognition of the role of culture as a catalyst to change our future.

Most Govanites would agree and the area is without doubt the one with the strongest sense of identity amongst the cityrsquos older working class districts.Many people would know that Govan was the former World Capital of Shipbuilding where at its height in the ldquoThree Yairds, men produced about a quarter of the worldrsquos tonnage of ships.They might also know that Govan was one of the cradles of the labour movement, with the emergence of trades unions, the co-operative organisations and the Labour Party, with a strong tradition of struggle from the Rent Strikes of World War One, through to the occupation of the shipyards in the early s with the UCS work-in. And would be aware that with the decline of shipbuilding in the last  years, Govan has fallen on hard times, its population reduced to less than , from the figure of , when the burgh was annexed by Glasgow in .But would they know that Govan is considerably older than Glasgow which annexed it  And that for centuries, as an ecclesiastical centre of the ancient Kingdom of Strathclyde, it was more important than the city  Would they know anything about Govanrsquos collection of early Christian incised stones, one of the finest in Scotland and indeed the UK .Possibly not and it might well surprise more than a few that Govan can claim to have the finest collection of A-listed buildings and public sculpture outside the city centre and west end of Glasgow, dating from the time of its economic prosperity and industrial greatness. Those yet ignorant ndash and even those in the know, since Govan is changing and developing after decades of stagnation ndash should hop on that clockwork orangeand disembark at Govan Cross subway station ndash and take the following walkabout round Central Govan as an introduction to hopefully further personal explorations.THE WALK. Around Govan Cross you see the beneficial effects of the Town Centre Action Plan, which at a cost of pound. million ndash a bankerrsquos bonus ndash made an improvement to the area, providing paving, seating, signage ndash and a restoration of the Aitken Fountain. This was an  memorial to Govanrsquos first Medical Officer of Health whose sanitary improvements massively reduced death rate in the mid-th century.As well as many other insignia the fountain sports the coat of arms of the burgh of Govan, established in , which shows ying icons but always a shiprsquos engineer and a shiprsquos carpenter. See how many such emblems you can spot on your ramble ndash and whether you can spot a single Glasgow one!There is much to here but the jewel is the refurbished former British Linen Bank by Salmon  Gillespie, an A-listed tenement from , with a delightful open-crown metal roof. Its sculptures are especially fine look at the one above the door showing two male angels driving a sailing boat by blowing their conches. Here you stand on Water Row, once a Roman road to a Clyde crossing, later the centre of the fishing and weaving community.. Moving west along the Govan Road, on your left is a statue of William Pearce, owner of the Fairfield yard and Govan MP in the s. Coming from the Chatham naval dockyard he brought war work and massive prosperity to Fairfieldrsquos, and to himself, dying worth a present day fortune of pound million. He stands beside Brechinrsquos Bar, a mock baronial building from over a century ago, which was originally Cardellrsquos Temperance Institute.Once when in there the punter next me at the bar turned unannounced and stated, ldquoSee that Noam Chomsky, we had him in here in the Year of Culture. I have never investigated the truth of this, nor of the claim of the regulars of Brechinrsquos that, at chucking out time, the Black Man, as they call the statue, takes a few steps.Opposite Brechinrsquos is located the Pearce Instutute or PI, known as the Heart of Govan. Lady Pearce gave the money for its foundation in memory of her husband and it opened in  as a cultural and social centre, with a theatre, library, billiard room and washing and cooking facilities for the majority who lacked adequate facilities. These were located in the Womenrsquos area, entered by a separate door. Times change, and females can enter the front door nowadays. The A-Listed PI was designed by Edinburgh architect Rowand Anderson in an eclectic style one half Dutch Renaissance, the other Scottish Vernacular. Atop the latter part sits a metal galleon made by the workers of Fairfields, who also contributed much free labour to helping build the. PI... Moving further west we reach the War Memorial to those killed in the First World War, behind which lies another of Govanrsquos glories, the Old Kirk . Space prohibits more than mentioning that this ndash also by Rowan Anderson ndash stands on a site that has probably been one of Christian worship for  years and a pagan one beforehand, and that it contains one of the finest collections of incised early Christian stones in Scotland, over  ndash crosses, grave slabs and the famous Govan Hogbacks as well as thereputed sargophacus of St Constantine. The connections with the Reformationand the Iona Community, add further fascination. .Between here and the next stop, Fairfields, there stands a iety of tenement buildings, some in good repair, some in less ndash and examples of the new tenements built in the last  years. The Lyceum, a former art-deco palace of a cinema is also passed and high up on it is an illustration of the original Lyceum Music Hall, destroyed in a fire. When it opened in , a packed audience heard a performance of Bizetrsquos Carmen. See Govan, see Kulcher.. On reaching ElderStreet on the right, the gates of the former Fairfield Yard, now BAE Systems, loom into view no longer do  men stream in and out of here twice a day the old tramlines which brought goods into the yards are still visible amongst the cobbles. A further walk along Govan Road brings you to the impressive front door of the former offices of the yard, now Fairfield Heritage, hosting a fine display on the history of shipbuilding housed in a building to match. The offices were designed by Keppie and Honeyman, the firm Macintosh later worked for, and though splendid inside, their finest feature is the doorway itself where amongst the usual icons of nymphs and Neptune, stand two le-size sandstone scultures of working men done by Pittendreich Macgillivray. This building is also A-Listed..Though achieving its maximum size under Pearce, the yard became a world leader under the previous owners, the Elders. Crossing the road gives a good view of the office building and also allows entrance to Elder Park, the only piece of ground in central Govan formerly not covered by tenements or industry. The park has a ied collection of sculptures relating to Govanrsquos history and a boating pond. Previously there was also a dairy farm and a small zoo!Just south of the park gates stands a statue of John Elder, leaning on the compound steam engine he invented, which gave Clyde shipbuilding a competitive edge. The statue was exectued by Boehm and is complemented by one of Isabella Elder herself further over in the park. Despite the importance of this place it was shockingly refused a Heritage Lottery grant some years ago ndash while many less worthy were not.Exiting the park is done from behind the library, with its splendid cast iron railings, and very fine frontage. The building was designed by another top Glasgow architect, J.J Burnet, and Govanites are proud of the fact they had a public library in  some years before Glasgow built their ious examples. Inside the building are busts of the Elders, and an interesting painting of pre-industrial Govan by Brotchie. This building is also A -Listed.. Moving back eastalong pedesrianised Langlands Road through an assortment of housing built to replace demolished tenements, brings us to Golspie Street, with its stunning ldquoAmsterdam-style new tenement, and then past the car park for the Govan Shopping Centre till we emerge back at Brechinrsquos and the Black Man with a very clear view of the PI. Back at Govan Cross, visit the excellent Cafe . Rest and reflect that you have only scraped the surface of central Govan, never mind Greater Govan...andyou leave unimpressed, there is no hope for you.Ian R Mitchell is the author of Walking through Glasgowrsquos Industrial Past "},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-hugh-macdonald-never-met-fidelma-feel-like-many-part-life","story":"This later caused her some embarrassment in her role as a waitress on a floating hotel. It was not plain sailing for me, either. Stilettos were not ideally suited for my afternoon duties as centre-half for Blantyre Celtic.This recollection of me as Bambi on horse anaesthetic is highly analogous to my faltering steps into Fidelmarsquos fiefdom. This bailiwick is guarded by an imperious Afghan hound, seems to have a lingering scent of jasmine and the soft echo of the pop of something sparkling.There is a straightforward choice when invading this space. Does one mumble something inane  Or does one acknowledge the absence of Fidelma and confront it head-on with the stark but sincere crudity of a Glasgow kiss  I have only reluctantly discarded the inanities option since it is, after all, my superpower. It has, though, been overwhelmed by the realisation there is something important to be said about absence, particularly in the case of one, specic columnist.There was a moment last week when I read the words of Fidelmarsquos son and was hit by an epiphany with the force of that aforementioned Glasgow kiss. His account of a draining trip to visit his mother in hospital contained what is called a vignette. .It was this: the weary traveller confronts ailing mum. He asks a question. There is no immediate answer. Has he not been recognised \"Was it my face mask  Was she so sick that she did not recognise mehellip  It felt like minutes had passed before she mumbled weakly through her mask, lsquoYou could have at least worn a shirt and maybe some white shorts. Itrsquos such a waste to see you dress badly like the French.rsquo\"Regressing to my superpower of uttering banalities, I told myself that many of her readers would similarly be unacquainted with Fidelma in the narrow terms of physical meetings, private conversations.This points to the brilliance of a certain kind of newspaper column. There are many columnists who make extraordinary claims about their work. They can be the Voice of Anything From Reason To Football to Interpretation of Sanskrit Scrolls.One famous financial columnist was once told by a sub-editor that his latest offering was unintelligible. \"I am writing for three people in England,\" the columnist replied. \"And you are not one of them.\" The three comprised the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the governor of the Bank of England and the permanent under-secretary to the Treasury, apparently. This story sounds so authentic to an old hack that it might almost be true.It is certainly irrefutable that many columns totter uneasily on the twin pillars of certainty and unbridled preaching, both based on a solid foundation of ego.Now, Fidelma may be read by the Chancellor of the Exchequer or, I suspect, by the First Minister. But she is not writing for him or her. She is writing for herself. She takes her le with its routine humiliations, its senseless pain and its occasional, and overwhelming joy and presents it to us with an eloquence that is only superseded by her bravery. She tells us every Saturday how she is feeling as a dog sulks, bones complain and her house gently falls down around her.There is anger, contentment, bitterness, resignation, humour, sadness, happiness and even consolation in all of this. The dog finally comes in. The pain usually subsides.

The fact that the current First Minister has known it all along and, even worse, the civil service people dragooned into writing and supporting it knew it, is for me a much bigger scandal than what Alex Salmond got up to or Nicola Sturgeons involvement was.The deception and hype from Mr Salmond and his team bloated the Yes result from  per cent at the start to % and have fuelled all the ision, scandal, ridiculous parades and border patrols, neglected government and ravaging uncertainty ever since.Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven.I WAS stunned by the blatant bias in the documentary The Trial Of Alex Salmond ,which was yet more evidence that the BBC is no longer capable of impartial reporting and that is a tragedy, given its deserved worldwide reputation. It does not augur well for its coverage of a likely second Scottish independence referendum in the near future. Kirsty Wark is a friend of prominent Labour politicians and has holidayed with a former First Minister, Jack McConnell.The documentary bore all the hallmarks of one in production in anticipation of a very dferent verdict which, perhaps, Ms Wark craved. Thirteen High Court jurors, who had heard hours of evidence, it must be remembered, decided that Mr Salmond was not guilty, despite the prosecution having the top QC from the Crown Office. This documentary seemed to fail to grasp this. Why was it even broadcast at the very time the Holyrood inquiry began This whole episode was shameful and I am saddened more than angry. The BBC follows an agenda these days whether it be Brexit, the EU, President Trump, Boris Johnson, Channel migrants, BLM, LGBT, the police, racism, Extinction Rebellion and more. Nothing figures more prominently in that agenda than the preservation of the Union of The United Kingdom. Was this documentary another salvo in that war John V Lloyd, Inverkeithing.GIVE TEACHERS A MORE PROMINENT ROLE IN REVIEWI AGREE with Denis Brucethat the Governments U-turn on exam results was political: youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds protesting about unfair treatment was not good \"optics\" for the SNP. Speaking as a teacher though, its been disappointing that much of the focus since seems to have been political: \"get that man out of his job\".I had hoped for a wider debate about how we examine our young people the SQAs methods of assessment are much the same as they were for the grandparents of those protesting. In my own subject,  per cent of a students award is determined by a - minute, hand-written exam. A year or two of learning boiling down to that May morning in the exam hall. Its time to look at alternatives.Within the review of SQA procedures, serious consideration should be given into allowing teacher judgment to take a more prominent role. As a matter of course, teachers regularly assess their pupilsto check understanding and progress. Grading of these assessments by teachers could be combined with the SQAs traditional assessment methods to produce a final mark. This would lower the stakes of the end-of-year exam as well as encourage more pupils to engage throughout the academic year, rather than cram at the last minute.Callum Mitchell, Largs.DENIS Bruce is lavish in his criticism of John Swinney, but in writing that Mr Swinney \"has succeeded in ramping up grade inflation, leaving employers and higher institutions wondering whether some of the results are worth the paper they are written on\", he is also insulting the intelligence and professionalism of teachers, employers and those working within the higher institutions.Given all the stramash regarding the grades awarded to young people south of the Border, questions must arise over the intelligence of their Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, who might have been expected to learn from and quickly follow Mr Swinneys example, but no Mr Williamson agonisingly strung things along until finally capitulating and executing his U-turn. UK politicians are iniably ignorant about what is happening in Scotland, but perhaps next time Mr Williamson should pay attention he might learn something.Ruth Marr, Stirling.NOW that the dust is beginning to settle over the intensely emotional furore over the now notorious algorithmic effect upon exam results, this may well be the right time to reflect rationally upon the purpose of exams for the inidual and the community.For the inidual, an exam tests the competency of the inidual in that area under examination.The result in the exam shows whether the inidual has the capacity to proceed further in that direction, needs to put more effort in to improve in that subject,the inidual wishes to continue with that line, or to seek another area more in keeping with the iniduals talents.For the community which depends upon the ranking order of exam results, such asemployers and higher institutions, exam results provide the opportunity to select those who are best placed to meet the challenges their selection places upon them.To ensure that the results carry credibility, there needs to be a quality control agency to validate nationally the standards of the certicates.If the exams do not produce a satisfactory range of results, their validity would be questionable.Grade inflation comes into that category, posing the question: \"Are the exams too easy, are the examinees cleverer or are the teachers today more effective than their predecessors  \"Ask yourself which of those three sides you would come down upon and you will be well on your way to find out how you would react to another such fiasco as the one we have just experienced.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.ACROSS Scotland this past week schools were being closed down amid new outbreaks of Covid-.If we had taken the time during lockdown and during the summer holidays to devise a system of national lesson plans, with a standard national lesson delivered on the same subject at the same time on the same day to the same age group, wouldnt we now be in a position to broadcast these lessons to pupils stuck at home through digital TV  What is so hard about putting lessons on the telly  Wasnt the Open University broadcasting lectures back in the s when we only had three black and white TV channels Nigel Boddy, Darlington.TIME TO TACKLE THE TAKEAWAY CULTUREWHAT a brilliant feature by Joanna Blythman .

Physically he was also tall and handsome, totally imperturbable, probably from having faced the worst. He was someone whose best qualities most of us would strive to emulate, and fail. Branwen described him as her rock. He was.I saw him last in February in Glasgow, we went for a drink or two in the Doublet on the edge of his native Partick, then to the Shish Mahal for a curry, where we planned the trip we would never take. The original one, viewed from now, had its moments of high farce.He had told his family that he was going grape-picking in France, instead he was travelling to Paris on a single ticket and a handful of change to pick up explosives to deliver to comrades in Madrid who were planning to blow up Franco and his cabinet on a dais at Real Madridrsquos Bernabeacuteu stadium. The only French he knew was zut alors, which amused his anarchist hosts, and his Spanish was non-existent. He was to wear a bandage on his hand so his contact could recognise him and he had to be taught a phrase ndash me duele la manondash as a coded response.He set out to the south with the plastic explosive taped to his body, hitchhiking and wearing a kilt so that hersquod get lts, which led to reports in the Argentine press that a Scottish transvestite had tried to kill the Caudillo. His last lt in France broke down just short of the Spanish border and Stuart had to push the car across, sweating and hoping the plastic would hold firm, under the gaze of the Guardia Civil in their shiny, patent, three-cornered hats.The mission had been infiltrated by an informer and when Stuart handed over the package to Fernando Carballo Blanco, a carpenter who was constructing the dais and would place the charges, they were swooped on. It was August , A Hard Dayrsquos Night was top of the hit parade and Alec Douglas-Home was Prime Minster, doing economics with matches. The two were convicted on September  in a brief trial before a military tribunal, Blanco given  years.It was undoubtedly international pressure and publicity that deterred the lsquocourtrsquo from passing the customary death sentence for lsquoterrorismrsquo, which was then carried out by garrotte, the medieval process of neck-breaking in a slow mechanical strangulation by a metal collar and a bolt through the neck.Stuart was mildly roughed-up by Francorsquos secret police but he was forced to watch his co-conspirator brutally tortured. Blancorsquos father had been shot and murdered by Francorsquos forces for being a trade unionist, driving his mother mad with grief and ending in an asylum. Although Stuart was released after just less than four years after an appeal by his mother, Blanco served  years. When I was contacted by his niece last week she denied that he had been a hero. ldquoHe just wanted to free the Spanish people, she said.Franco was an unapologetic fascist and dictator who led the overthrow of the Republican government, precipitating the civil war, with the blood of many thousands, and not just combatants, on his hands. As he put it: ldquoOur regime is based on bayonets and blood, not on hypocritical elections.Stuartrsquos memory of the show trial, conducted in Spanish of course which he could not then understand, was of  army officers, heavy with medals, swords on the table in front of them, comprising what passed for a jury in a large, sticky, vaulted room. He said he felt he had been transported into the final act of some grand opera. ldquoI was  years and six weeks old, a boy from working-class Glasgow and Irsquod never been to the opera, he remembered.He learned Spanish in the Carabanchel jail and sat A-levelsand was sent money regularly from Britain but also from Spanish anarchists. The only English names they seemed to know were John, Paul, George and Ringo, so the donations turned up in these names and the authorities thought he was being funded by the Beatles.He was released in , got work as a gas fitter as Britain was converting to North Sea gas and inadvertently almost blew up a large part of Essex when he was unable to stop a massive gas leak.In , after having been arrested and spending  months in jail on remand, Stuart was acquitted of being a member of the Angry Brigade, which had carried out a series of casualty-less explosions against Edward Heathrsquos government. He claimed, and the jury believed him, that the police had planted two detonators in his car. One of the four of the convicted Stoke Newington Eight, John Barker, said later about his own experience, ldquoThe police fitted-up a guilty man.Two years later Stuart and I holidayed in a remote cottage up a narrow, pebbled track outside Oban, where we walked, talked and sank a few malts in the evening round a roaring fire. At the same time a Francoist banker had been kidnapped by an anarchist group and a ransom paid. When Stuart ed to London he was warned by a friendly Special Branch officer that he wasnrsquot safe and should get out of town, which he did with his we Brenda, first to Yorkshire and then the remote Orkney island of Sanday, to a house called Over the Water.Then, the island might have been some prototype of an anarchist society, in that it was peacefully,bibulously, self-governing, with only an occasional police presence coming in by ferry from the mainland, the officersrsquo travel well telegraphed. Irsquom not sure anyone there bothered with car insurance. On one occasion a man was arrested for alleged drunk driving, the local doctor refused to test him and by the time the coppers had somehow managed to hire a boat and take him to the main island he was sober.I visited him and Brenda often, and many an evening was spent in the Kettletoft Hotel bar, often with instruments and a sing-song going, irregardless of conventional closing time, until the last patron exited. On one occasion two bold officers turned up and insisted that the bar was cleared at pm, to the considerable ire and disgruntlement of those of us who considered the evening was just beginning.There was a party to go to and Stuart and some others light-heartedly berated the two policemen now sitting in a car outside with the windows down. While he and they kept the officers occupied someone crept round the back of the car and let the tyres down.We sped off waving.Stuart and Brenda spent seven years on Sanday, Branwen was born there, and from the island he launched his publishing house the Cienfuegos Press , a major publisher of anarchist literature, and a radical newspaper, the Free-Winged Eagle. The local minister of course denounced him as the ldquoanti-Christ.Stuart Christie was born in Partick to a hairdresser and a hard-drinking trawlerman, Albert. He was named Stuart after Bonnie Prince Charlie, ldquothe only man in history to be called after three separate sheepdogs, according to fellow Partiquois Billy Connolly. When he was six his parents went to friends for a drink, his dad was given a glass of sherry which he looked at in disgust, poured down the sink and walked out the door without saying a word. ldquoThe joke was that he had gone for a packet of fags, but thatrsquos the last time we saw him until he turned up  years later, Christie recalls.By then Stuart had a half-sister, Olivia. But the formative influence on him had been his granny Agnes McCulloch Davis, with whom he did most of his growing up on Arran and in Glasgow. He described her as the moral barometer in his le, ldquoand she provided the star I followed. She kept me on the straight and narrow.

This is not a normal year: the UK was faced with tackling coronavirus and saving lives and it meant effectively shutting down large parts of the economy and paying almost  million people not to go to work, at a cost of poundbillion so far. But from August, employers have had to start contributing towards the cost of furlough and the scheme is expected to end in October. The question is: what then The Chancellor Rishi Sunak says there is no possibility of an extension because of the economic cost and he points out that most other countries are making similar moves to phase out their schemes. But one country that isnrsquot is Germany. The government there is expected to announce next week that it will extend Kurzarbeit, which was the model for furlough, from  months to two years and the reason the finance minister Olaf Scholz gave was clear. ldquoThe corona crisis wonrsquot suddenly disappear in the next few weeks, he said.The German finance ministerrsquos logic is hard to refute. The economic damage done by coronavirus will not stop suddenly in October just because the Chancellor has stopped the furlough scheme ndash indeed, the end of furlough will deepen the trouble for many employers and itrsquos likely the real nature and scale of the economic crisis will only become obvious then. There are some businesses that would be perfectly viable in normal circumstances that may go underfurlough is abruptly ended.The picture also looks grim for particular sectors that continue to be badly hit. Some remain completely shut down ndash the countryrsquos theatres and concert venues for example. Others, such as pubs and restaurants, are being forced to operate way below their normal capacity, thereby hitting profits. For these sectors, the furlough scheme will continue to be essential way beyond October and the UK Government should think again about an extension.Naturally, the cost of such an extension is a concern, but it must be weighed against the possible costs of not extending, the biggest of which could be mass unemployment the cost of borrowing has also never been so low ndashever there was a time to borrow for the sake of the economy, this is it. It might also be possible to limit the cost of extending the furlough scheme by targeting it at the areas that need it most.The uncertain effect of withdrawing furlough, and the fact that it will not apply equally across the economy or dferent parts of the UK, also points to a particular dficulty for the Scottish Government. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments have taken slightly dferent decisions at dferent times and yet the devolution settlement means the Scottish Government could not extend furlough in Scotland because it does not have the borrowing powers to fund it. The First Minister has repeatedly complained about this and it is time the UK Government listened.There are other ideas the UK Government should consider as we hopefully move from crisis into containment into recovery. Scrapping or freezing employersrsquo national insurance payments for example. A holiday on business rates would also help the countryrsquos town centres to begin the fight-back. All of it will cost ndash and all of it will have to be paid back in some way in due course ndash but the alternative is a clf-edge in October that will deepen the economic crisis rather than ease it.

When it was rising, interest rates were increased to discourage borrowing and encourage saving thereby reducing the money supply in the system to buy goods and services. The result was prices stabilised and any increases were modest.The converse of that scenario is a reduction in interest rates to encourage spending and investment, which is where we are today.

The SNP chose to withdraw from the convention as independence was not a constitutional option, and it subsequently collapsed.Ultimately in  the Labour Government under Tony Blair promised the creation of devolved institutions and a referendum was held later that year and the Scottish Parliament was re-created as a result of the Scotland Act of . Mr Blair therefore was instrumental in firing the starting pistol on the final stretch of the road towards Scottish independence by establishing devolution in an effort to silence the SNP for several generations.When a new state of the art parliament building was built, with many devolved powers granted and a large clutch of MSPs in situ a complete parliamentary machine was gted to the SNP on a plate. The only fly in the ointment is Boris Johnson, who resolutely refuses to grant a Section  order, not to mention the many compelling arguments against the breakup of the Union. On the other hand the BBC has contributed to the recent rise in support for independence by affording Nicola Sturgeon a  to grandstand on national television almost every day for the past five months. I donrsquot blame her for jumping at the chance to place the SNP firmly in front of the nation by leading these sessions and it is plain for all to see that she enjoys basking in the limelight. We all need to be briefed on developments in respect of Covid- but a short bulletin a couple of times per week would suffice.Nevertheless it has taken  years for the SNP fortunes to reach the point where independence could be imminent and it is high time for the Unionists to wake up and become more vocal before the May Holyrood elections precipitate a landslide into oblivion.Christopher H Jones, Gfnock.UK press and media cite Business for Scotland Panelbase and Times YouGov August  poll figures respectively of  per cent and % support for Scottish independence. These figures exclude Donrsquot Knows and are partial, inflated \"headline figures\" that provide a basis for misleading reporting.Actual Panelbase and YouGov poll figures respectively show For % and %, Against % and %, Donrsquot Knows % and % . These produce simple averages of For .%, Against .%, Donrsquot Knows %.Support for independence has been rising over , is clearly higher than for remaining within the UK and lies around % . However, whether or not there is majority support for independence is not proven and there has not yet been sustained majority support over a period of time demonstrated for independence. There is therefore no convincing opinion poll case at present to support a second independence referendum. Nor has there been any reversal of the  Referendum   result, contrary to the misleading statement by Business for Scotland .Use of actual poll figures including Donrsquot Knows at the \"headline level\" are essential for objective use of statistics and balance of reporting.Whether or not the Panelbase poll of a % majority for independence continues to be reflected across dferent polls and strengthens over a sustained period of time is an issue, though so also is what happens to the Donrsquot Knows.The level of support for Scotland remaining within the UK has fallen signicantly since  at currently .% , a reflection of Scottish views on Brexit and Conservative governments since  the success of the SNP and First Minister on public perceptions of performance and confusion over UK and Scottish government responsibilities.Dont Knows might well be expected though to vote for the status quo given financial uncertainties and risks.

This is an uncertain proposition that could only be tested in a referendum, but is as much a reasonable proposition for consideration and debate as using partial inflated   and   figures that exclude Donrsquot Knows.John Garrity, Chichester.PETER A Russells concern for Alex Salmond and Scotlands justice systemhas a hollow ring to it, but I agree thatthere was a plot to have Mr Salmond thrown into jail for crimes he did not commit, it is certainly a most serious matter. Surely,anyone has evidence of such a thing the correct procedure would be to immediately contact the police, as the withholding of evidence is also a serious crime.However, I strongly suspect that, in the first place, there is no evidence because there was no plot, and in the second place, that Mr Russells demand for justice to be done is more to do with the latest opinion poll, showing support for Scottish independence now standing at  per cent, rather than any real concern for Mr Salmond and the justice system.Ruth Marr, Stirling.It is touching to witness Peter A Russells eagerness to see Alex Salmond obtain justice for himself and Scotlands criminal justice system. In support, he cites the observations of another two of yesterdays men, Jim Sillars and Kenny MacAskill.I am afraid that the latter lost a lot of my respect due to his handling of the Al-Megrahi situation. Dr Jim Swire tirelessly pursued the need for a review of the case providing evidence of several flaws in the trial in the Hague carried out under the jurisdiction of the Scottish justice system. Mr MacAskill refused to accept that there was any doubt as to Al-Megrahis guilt and he defended the Crown Prosecution services evidence virtually without question. Thereafter, he could not arrange the transfer of the convicted man to Libya quickly enough. This may well have been the start of the downturn of his own political career.It saddens me that Mr Salmond and the others cannot accept their diminished influence in the SNP and appear intent on undermining the cause of independence that they have worked so hard to deliver. The former party leader has been cleared of all charges against him even though his reputation has been tarnished by some of his own admissions during the trial. He has little to gain from washing any dirty linen in public, an outcome which Mr Russell is clearly hoping will damage the cause of independence which he hates so much.Gordon Evans, Burnside.I PREFACE my comments by saying there is no acceptable level for crimes against the person including sexual assault and rape. However, itrsquos appalling and a sad indictment of pathetic state of the opposition at Holyrood that Tory MSPS Liam Kerr would attempt to make political capital out of a blip in Julyrsquos sexual crime statistics . When taken in conjunction with the previous three months the levels of sexual crimes are actually substantially reduced.If Mr Kerr believes Police Scotland is underfunded then perhaps he could do something constructive and ask his masters in Westminster to increase the Block Grant after all what Westminster begrudgingly gives Holyrood to run the country is less than half the revenue generated in Scotland.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.ON Friday Scottish Labour Leader Richard Leonard delivered a keynote speech, unveiling plans to transform the Scottish economy.

Unlike many AI voices, it has been given a gender-neutral, north east of England accent.Verena Rieser, Professor in Computer Science at Heriot-Watt University, where researchers will look into methods employed to build conversational agents, said: ldquoWhen people think of Amazonrsquos Alexa, they probably imagine a woman, perhaps in some sort of secretarial position.ldquoWe are askingthey have to be female and so human-like ldquoThen there is the behaviour of these systems when they are asked something thatrsquos not appropriate.ldquoThe danger is that when people interact with these systems they may reinforce gender stereotypes: you are talking to a woman, insulting her and yet she is not even pushing back.The three-year study will involve research on the psychological impacts of the AI voices to be carried out by researchers at Strathclyde University and which will analyse what messages the female AI voices convey and how they might influence behaviour.While a digital education element will also be carried out by researchers at Edinburgh University, which will look at how AI systems are constructed.ldquoWe are interested in finding out why these systems are the way they are andit stems from the fact that the people who build them are not a very erse workforce, added Prof. Rieser.Amazon has previously said test users responded most strongly to a female voice for its Alexa assistant. Microsoft has also said it found a female voice best embodied the qualities expected of a digital assistant ndash helpful, supportive and trustworthy.Meanwhile Google has said that it planned to use a male voice for its assistant, but the technology responded better to a higher pitched female format. Last year it introduced  dferent voices in an effort to introduce more ersity.However, itrsquos possible that the AI voice of the future could be less obliging young secretary and a little more CP.Prof. Rieser added: ldquoThe argument in the original UNESCO report says we dont have to make them human voices, and they could be much more clearly robotic.ldquoBut then,you make them too robotic, does that make them creepy Designing a Feminist Alexa ndash An Exercise in Empathic Design on Thursday, August , is part of the RSE Curious summer programme."},{"url":null,"title":"ron-mckays-diary-retrial-alex-salmond-seems-gathering-pace","story":"We already know from the court judgment that the first civil service inquiry was fatally flawed, potentially tainted by bias.

When protesters took to the streets of Belarus two weeks ago over the disputed election result that saw authoritarian president Alexander Lukashenko claim a sixth term, the security forcesrsquo crackdown was uncompromising.Undaunted, the people of Belarus continue to protest in unprecedented numbers, refusing to be cowed by state violence. According to Lukashenko, these are attempts to orchestrate a coup.But the question many are now asking is whether what we are witnessing is the beginning of another ldquocolour revolution, one with the potential to topple the post-Soviet ruler Speaking on Friday, Belarusian opposition politician Svetlana Tikhanovskaya who was forced to leave Belarus right after the vote, said she wouldto the country when she felt it was safe to do so.At a news conference in Lithuania, Tikhanovskaya said the people of Belarus wanted a new election to be held that would be free and fair. If events in the Belarusian capital Minsk these past days are any indicator, then Tikhanovskayarsquos assessment of what many of her fellow countrymen and women want is correct.Just when, though, it would be safe for the opposition leader toto Belarus, perhaps injecting fresh impetus into opposition protests, is another matter entirely.Earlier on Thursday, the Belarusian authorities opened a criminal probe against opposition activists who set up what it called a Co-ordination Council to negotiate the transition of power.The Belarusian prosecutor generalrsquos office said the creation of the council violated the constitution and opened a criminal inquiry against its founders on charges of threatening national security.ldquoThe creation and the activities of the Co-ordination Council are aimed at seizing power and inflicting damage to the national security, prosecutor general Alexander Konyuk was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.The council consists of top associates of Tikhanovskaya as well as rights activists and representatives of striking workers. It also includes the nationrsquos most famous author, Svetlana Alexievich, who won the  Nobel Prize in Literature.In tandem with the criminal probe, the regime has again also beefed up a security presence on the streets of the capital, blocking access to some government buildings and deploying police and paramilitaries in numbers outside major factories where workers have been on strike since early last week.ldquoThere should no longer be any disorder in Minsk of any kind, Lukashenko instructed his security officials, indicating he has no intention of backing down from his -year rule, one of the worldrsquos longest.ldquoPeople are tired. People demand peace and quiet, Lukashenko added. He also confirmed that border controls had been tightened to prevent an influx of ldquofighters and arms, again implying that some kind of armed coup attempt was in the making.One challenge Lukashenko is undoubtedly facing though has come from sections of the countryrsquos state-controlled media on whom the autocrat has long relied to shape public opinion. In the past week, hundreds of employees of state television have gone on strike. Journalists from the leading state-owned daily newspaper, Zvyazda, also joined their broadcast colleagues and put out a statement demanding an end to censorship.Vyacheslav Lomonosov, one of the Belarusian TV employees who joined the strike, said he and his colleagues could no longer tolerate an official ban on reporting the truth about the regimersquos crackdown on protestersldquoThere are people killed, raped, thousands are protesting, while theyrsquore saying everythingrsquos fine in the country and nothing is going on, said Lomonosov.ldquoIt canrsquot be like that, people need to get the truth from TV, the Associated Press reported him as saying.In the first days of the protests following the election, security forces and police deliberately targeted journalists from independent Belarusian news outlets and foreign media, detaining scores, beating some of them, damaging their equipment, and seizing memory cards.Boris Goretsky, vice-president of the Belarusian Association of Journalists, confirmed the  journalists were detained while covering the protests.But it has been ordinary Belarusians who have borne the brunt of the crackdown with at least three reported killed and over , arrested.According to human rights organisations, the fates of many remain unknown two weeks after the election, feeding fears that the authorities are deliberately covering up severe injuries, or worse, carried out by the security forces.Online search services have been organised to help families locate their missing loved ones, according to Radio Free Europe  Radio Liberty RFE RL.One of them, launched by the popular independent media outlet Tut.by with the title Have You Seen This Person  enables people to post images and information about the missing and the circumstances of their disappearance so readers can contribute information or assistance in the search.People can also turn to the Angel Search and Rescue Squad, a non-profit group set up in  that describes itself as the first volunteer movement in Belarus. Its Facebook page features a hotline for readers to call with information about missing iniduals.Last week, RFE RL cited one report by the Angel group posted August  on Facebook. It concerned missing museum director, -year-old Kanstantsin Shyshmakou, who the group says was found dead by members of its team, though it provided no other details of the circumstances.Shyshmakou is said to have been one of two members of his local election commission in the southwestern Belarusian city of Vawkavysk, who refused to sign off on the results of the August  election vote.The Belarus police and Interior Ministry have questioned the veracity of such accounts provided online. In a statement, ministry spokeswoman Volha Chamadanova insisted that such information often turns out to be inaccurate.ldquoThe criminal police of the Interior Ministry have checked the information regarding more than  participants of the unsanctioned ralliesthat has been published on the website Tut.by and in ious social networks, Chamadanova wrote.ldquoThis information is not fully accurate: many of these citizens have been found at home, while the information about them is not removed in a timely fashion from these internet resources.But last week, in accounts given to Deutsche Welle , the German public international broadcaster, several Belarusian women detailed their harrowing experiences during detention and accused the authorities of inflicting torture.One of the women, Olga Pavlova, was a campaign staffer for opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya and was detained for five days. In an interview with DW, Pavlova describes how she was put into a van, filled with other people detained, and sent to prison.ldquoThe men were immediately beaten. There was a Russian woman with us. She demanded access to the Russian ambassador, but she was taken into a neighbouring cell and beaten. They told her she would neverhome, Pavlova recounted.She described how she ended up in a cell designed for four but was packed with  people. When the prisoners asked for a window to be opened, two buckets of water were dumped on them. Those in the cell, she says, nearly suffocated on the evaporating moisture. One of the prisoners suffered from epilepsy, another from diabetes, the DW interview cited her as saying. Pavlova herself had been injured by rubber bullets and stun grenades while working to provide first aid to protesters on the streets.Faced with such intimidation and given what many say is the lack of clarity about what to do next, some observers believe the opposition movement could be seriously undermined. Others point to signs that the momentum of factory and industrial strikes could be waning.According to Sergey Dylevskiy who represents strikers at the giant Minsk tractor plant , about % of workers at the plant are on strike. The rest are too afraid to leave their jobs and support the movement, he said.But other opposition activists insist the lack of any centralised leadership is not a weakness. ldquoWersquore witnessing a unique situation when protests are decentralised and spontaneous, Maria Kolesnikova, a prominent opposition figure told the BBC in Minsk.ldquoI wouldnrsquot say that in order to continue the protests, we must have a leader.Without a clear figurehead, however, it remains uncertain whether the opposition can effectively mobilise those that take to the streets. It raises question, too, whether what we are witnessing is indeed another ldquocolour revolution on a par, say, with what happened in Ukraine.Some regional watchers are wary of such comparisons.ldquoMany commentators are comparing the situation in Belarus to Ukrainersquos Orange and Maidan revolutions in   and  respectively, insists Carl Bildt, former prime minister of Sweden who also previously served as the UNrsquos special envoy for the Balkans. ldquoBut Belarus is not Ukraine, and nor is it particularly helpful to apply the Maidan model to the scene playing out in Minsk and other Belarusian cities and towns.Writing in a recent article for the Australian Strategic Policy Institute , Bildt highlights how the Maidan movement was a direct response to the Ukrainian governmentrsquos attempt to abandon the cause of European integration and reform.The revolutionaries there openly mobilised under the banner of the European Union. In Belarusrsquos case, says Bildt, domestic concerns are clearly playing the ldquomore salient role, and questions about the countryrsquos orientation vis-a-vis Europe or Russia are almost totally absent.Rather than draw parallels with Ukraine, in Belarusrsquos case, Bildt points to the situation being analogous with Armenia in spring  when mass demonstrations led to the resignation there of longtime president Serzh Sargsyan and inaugurated a new democratic era for the country.But other players are closely watching what is unfolding in Belarus, not least Russia and its president Vladimir Putin, himself no fan of colour revolutions and who has warned European leaders against ldquounacceptable meddling in the political crisis in Belarus.Last week, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov reiterated Moscowrsquos intention of protecting its influence over its longtime client state.ldquoWhat is happening in Belarus worries us very muchthinsp ...No-one is making a secret of the fact that this is about geopolitics, the fight for the post-Soviet space, Lavrov insisted.In all, Russia faces a bit of a dilemma over Belarus. That quandary was summed up on Thursday in a Financial Times article that asked the crucial questions as to how Moscow can ldquomaintain control when the dust settles, and through who .This is complicated further by the fact that while relations between Lukashenko and Putin have often been strategic, they have not exactly always been cordial.ldquoThe best option for the Kremlin now is not to sit and wait but to prepare for and manage a succession away from Lukashenko to a regime that would rely, in electoral terms, on the pro-Russian majority of Belarus, was how Dmitri Trenin, head of think tank the Carnegie Moscow Centre summed up the possible way forward for the Kremlin to the FT.But right now, of course, Belarus is not the only thing on Moscowrsquos mind. There is also the outcry over the alleged poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, a foe of Putin and a campaigner against corruption who has arrived in Germany from Siberia for treatment.Back in Belarus though it is the standoff between the regime and opposition that all eyes are focused on. As its stands, some see Lukashenko as having three options.One is wearing down the opposition through intimidation and arrests, though on that front he appears up against it given the scale of protests.Second, he could resort to martial law. Last but not least, he might call on Moscowrsquos help.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise. Assurances that Ministers will now ‘pick up the ball again’ are likely to ring hollow with islanders who just want a date for cheaper fares to be introduced.“Meantime, Ministers could help soften the blow from the delayed introduction of RET by using the underspend to cut fares on Orkney’s internal ferry services. At the very least this would prevent funds earmarked for Orkney being redirected to transport projects where in Scotland.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Cànan, ‘S na DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

The rest were reduced by a single grade and she has missed out on As in English, Biology and Modern Studies, as well as a C in Higher Chemistry.Eva said to have her grades knocked down so signicantly has made her “completely reconsider her career path”.Exams were cancelled this year because of Covid- and replaced with estimated grades based on past attainment, and the school’s previous exam record.The modelling system adapted by the Scottish Qualications Authority reduced the grades of around , results, with analysis suggesting youngsters from poorer backgrounds and historically poorer performing schools suffered disproportionately.In her letter, shared almost , times on Twitter, Eva said that “it was clear” that her grades had been signicantly adjusted “because I go to a school classed as underperforming”.Her letter calls for the system, which she describes as discriminatory, to be urgently investigated, adding: “The government has been pushing the ‘no wrong path slogan’ but why should pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and deprived areas be forced into a pathway they didn’t want and worked tirelessly to avoid”.Eva had been predicted in her fourth year to achieve  As and two Cs at national five level, but in her exams she improved to come out with five As and a B.She added that her school’s recent performance had been affected by staff shortages.She had stayed behind after school for extra tuition, aiming to secure a university place and a career in the field of medicine.“Any further efforts by pupils to achieve higher grades in schools which have historically underperformed has been disregarded, she added.“SQA results this year have been more about fitting the statistical trends than the inidual pupil.”According to the Scottish Government#s own statistics, the estimated . per cent of most deprived pupils who would have expected an A-C band at Higher was lowered to . per cent by the SQA#s moderation system. By contrast, for the least deprived pupils, the predicted . per cent for A-C grades was lowered to . per cent.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that it would not be “credible” to have accepted the high pass rates as recommended by teachers.The First Minister and education secretary John Swinney both urged pupils to appealthey feel they have been treated unfairly.Both Highland Council and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar have said overall pass rates in the region were up on the previous year"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Shieling-on-Barvas-River-I-F-Grant-Collection-Edinburgh-Central-Library-2-scaled.jpg","title":"digging where we stand memories from the airigh shieling for a post covid new","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineOur hyper-globalised, high-octane way of le was stopped in its tracks in a matter of weeks, and many of us found ourselves confined to our local communities, with a great deal of spare time on our hands.The TaD team have – fortunately – been able to continue working from home, and over these past few months I have been lucky enough to have conversations with some of our contributors and their families, speaking about recordings from the past, but naturally reflecting on those times and comparing them with the situation we find ourselves in today.One conversation of note was with a relative of a contributor who was recorded in the early s., the ethnologist and previous TaD columnist, Mairi MacFadyen, referred to Alastair McIntosh’s idea that we should ‘dig where we stand’ in order to find meaning and to regain a ‘sense of place’.Mairi then explains: “The idea is that by researching and learning about our own history and the place we are living, we – as iniduals and as groups – can regain some control over the understanding of our lives and our inter-connectedness..”, or the shieling. – the seasonal moving of livestock and people, still practiced today in many parts of the world including the mountainous regions of Norway, Alpine and sub-Alpine Europe, and the Pyrenees.In the Highlands, the practice was widespread until the early to mid-th century when much of the moorland on which the communites had their shielings were claimed by the landowners and used for sheep runs, and for hunting., where the contributors are well aware of the custom of going to the shieling in their parents’ and grandparents’ generation... # of the sheep.Historically, this allowed the unenclosed crops in the township to grow undisturbed, and it allowed the livestock to take advantage of the superior seasonal grazing on the hills.. – the first day of may.The flitting took a lot of effort, but it was also a time full of excitement, for man and beast:., including cats for hunting the rats, but according to Donald MacDonald, dogs were not taken to the àirigh.On the first day the men would prepare the shieling huts, and the women would prepare a meal for everyone who had helped with the move, before leaving the children and younger women once everything was prepared.In Lewis the people stayed at the àirigh until the beginning of August., and they would come home at the weekends to go to church, often bringing fresh milk with them.. recited here in  by the Rev.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3301349.jpg--.jpg?1597840898000\n","title":"cullybckey volunteers praised","story":"Volunteers from Cullybackey Community Partnershipwere presented with a certicate from Mayor Councillor Peter Johnston recently to recognise their efforts during this Covid- pandemic.CCP volunteers stepped up to the mark through a number of dferent initiatives to help those most vulnerable in the area in recent months.One of those was the delivery of food parcels to those both in the village and those in outlying rural areas.

An employee at Danske Bank was even disinfecting a cash machine. People had a mixed reaction to the tightened guidelines, and whether the PSNI can or will enforce them.Judith Dickson from the town said she was worried about the rise in Covid- cases in the area but said it#s all our own fault.I think the guidelines will be enforcedthey can andthe police have the manpower, but I don#t think they do, she said. It#s up to people to report it but I don#t think they will.Gavin McCandless, who lives on the outskirts of the town, felt the temporary measures were necessary to keep everyone safe.Meanwhile, Sam Cree, who said he had the virus as far back as January, was in no doubt that a second wave was on its way.After developing a dry cough and losing his sense of taste and smell, Mr Cree was convinced he contracted Covid- but said he has fully recovered.He added that Mr Swann was correct in bringing down the gathering restrictions but was not impressed with the number of people visiting pubs.I just think there will be a second wave and people will have to learn to wear their masks going into shops, he said.Charlotte Weir and her friend Beverley Connor were much more critical of Stormont#s politicians and the PSNI in how they have handled the virus. Are there even enough police to stretch themselves that far and land at people#s doors  Charlotte asked. I just don#t think the politicians have a clue what they#re doing anymore to be honest.Beverley said: I don#t think there#s a chance the police will come in and enforce everything. There#s not enough of them.Bridget Mullen criticised the new lockdown measures and felt that allowing six people into your home is nowhere near as bad as staging a wedding with  to  people.I think the younger people are more lackadaisical because they don#t think it will affect them, she added.

The ruling came in legal challenges by two victims - including Jenner McNern,- to the continued impasse around introducing the scheme with an estimated cost of £mAugust   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThey lost legs, arms or their eyesight, but the victims who gathered outside Belfast High Court never lost heart.Yesterday, their long and exhausting years of struggle finally paid off as a judge declared that The Executive Office had unlawfully refused to advance their pension scheme.Justice McAlinden delivered a scathing ruling that surely made Sinn Fein squirm.Every legal argument advanced on behalf of Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill was demolished.Arrant nonsense, a truly shocking proposition, wilful disregard for the rule of law, or abject ignorance of whatmeans in a democratic society were just some of the terms used.How on earth did the party get it legally, politically and morally so wrong  Why fight a battle that you#re destined to lose in both a court of law and the court of public opinion  There was never going to be any other outcome.O#Neill has now agreed to nominate a department and progress the scheme. This embarrassing climbdown forced by the courts could have been avoided.Why did the Deputy First Minister not just do what she was legally obliged to do months ago  She could have saved victims so much additional trauma.You#d expect Sinn Fein to at least be PR savvy. The very powerful images of men and women in wheelchairs, or with white sticks, going into court at the start of the case, should have caused a serious rethink in the party.It argues that the pension scheme discriminates against former republican prisoners. It could have pursued that issue while allowing those who have suffered the most to apply for and receive the pension they#re entitled to.The Shinners were completely isolated on this one at Stormont and beyond. A section of their own base was certainly put out by the scheme#s criteria, but it was by no means a matter which incensed or roused the entire republican community. This wasn#t a nationalist versus unionist issue. The victims behind this legal action were from all sections of the community.There were plenty of people who support justice for the Bloody Sunday families, who believe the state committed many great wrongs over the years, who still wanted the pension paid.As well as Jenner McNern#s legal challenge, a case was also brought by Brian Turley, one of the #Hooded Men# subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment by the British Army in .As a survivor of torture, I was left with long-term injuries as a result of the actions of the state, he said yesterday.The delay in having to wait on my right to a pension can only be described as another form of torture. Turley said O#Neill had no right to stop the pension scheme and described her action as very unprofessional.Words like that wound Sinn Fein. When the party finds itself on the opposite side to a victim of state violence like him it should know that it#s on shaky ground. Negotiations will continue between Stormont and Downing Street over who foots the pensions# bill. Naomi Long#s Justice Department will now be designated to progress the scheme. Victims hope that it will be open for applications before Christmas. I feel elated, said Margaret Yeaman who was blinded in an IRA no-warning bomb in Banbridge in  and who has never seen the faces of her grandchildren.The ruling has brought immense relief, said Mark Kelly, who lost his legs in a  no-warning UVF bomb.It#s like a weight lted off my shoulders, said Philip Gault, left with le-changing injuries as a schoolboy when he was injured in on Bloody Friday in .I should never have had to take this case, said Jenner McNern, who lost her legs in the IRA#s Abercorn bomb that year.As they celebrated their win, the surviving victims remembered those who didn#t live to see it, like Paddy Cassidy and Raymond Trimble who died so recently.It was simultaneously a victory to savour, and to shame so many in society for not delivering for these courageous men and women years ago.

There was no response from Mr Hogan#s representatives last night.Dail to recall earlyThe three Coalition leaders, including the Greens# Eamon Ryan, have also bowed to Opposition pressure and agreed to an early recall of the Dail, which is now expected to sit again at the beginning of September, two weeks earlier than originally planned.The leaders of Fianna Fail and Fine Gael spoke separately with Mr Hogan by phone early yesterday afternoon to convey their feelings about the commissioner#s attendance at the dinner and his response to the controversy. Both men are deeply unhappy with Mr Hogan. Mr Varadkar separately told this newspaper that the commissioner#s apology should have happened sooner. Mr Hogan apologised for attending the dinner on Friday night only after Mr Martin called on him to do so. He had initially refused to express remorse, saying he had been assured that the event complied with public health guidelines.Read More EU commissioner Phil Hogan urged to resign amid golf dinner controversyAs the fallout from last Wednesday#s golf affair reverberates throughout the country, the spotlight will now turn to Supreme Court Judge Seamus Woulfe.

They will speak to the event organisers and will access CCTV footage to corroborate accounts of the night in question.The Sunday Independent has also learned that in the first week of July, Mr Hogan travelled from Brussels to the Netherlands to take part in a tournament organised by the Irish Wild Geese Golf Society, which is based in the Belgian capital.There were no travel restrictions between Belgium and the Netherlands at the time, but both countries are deemed unsafe for travel by the Irish Government.

But the majority of ordinary people across the country didn#t have the luxury to make such choices for the last five months.MisgivingsThe Sunday Independent has also learned that senior members of the judiciary, including the Chief Justice, have misgivings about Mr Justice Woulfe#s attendance at the gala dinner. Chief Justice Frank Clarke is to speak to Mr Justice Woulfe upon hisfrom holiday in the coming weeks.Mr Woulfe, who was attorney general until the end of June, has apologised for attending the dinner, saying his understanding was that it was within the Government#s Covid- guidelines. He has declined to offer further comment despite attempts to contact him this weekend.A court insider said the lack of support emanating from the judiciary was due to the courts being in recess and reluctance to get involved in public controversies. They do accept his apology is genuine and remorseful, the well-placed source said. But there are misgivings about how he ended up in this situation and the wisdom of it.There are also concerns at senior levels in Government. Having a Supreme Court judge in that room, it doesn#t sit well with me, said one Cabinet minister. Another Cabinet source said the Government will be unable to move on from the controversy until they#re all gone.The Garda investigation is focusing on whether the numbers in attendance at the event exceeded the numbers allowed in regulations. If necessary, detectives may corroborate their accounts with CCTV footage from the premises to confirm the numbers in attendance and that public health measures were in place.Read More Taoiseach: Golfing dinner a ‘monumental’ error of judgmentAccording to one informed source, the guests would only be interviewed about the eventgardai thought it necessary. A file will be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions when it is completed.The invitations to the event were issued by former Fianna Fail senator Donie Cassidy as president of the Oireachtas Golf Society Committee and by Noel Grealish, the Independent TD, as its captain. In a statement of apology last Friday, Mr Cassidy said he had been legally advised not to make any further comment at this time. He confirmed he will co-operate fully with the Garda investigation.The source said reports that  people attended the event have not been disputed, and the figure is way above the numbers allowed under regulations. The issue, the source said, will be whether the partition wall that ided the room into two separate groups of fewer than  was enough to satisfy the regulations. That will probably be the key issue, he said.Mr Cassidy and Mr Grealish were seen meeting management of the Clden hotel by a party staying in the hotel in early July. One member of the party said the group recognised the politicians who appeared to be having a meeting with management.Former Fine Gael minister and MEP Brian Hayes, now a high-profile banking lobbyist, has apologised unreservedly for attending the dinner.Read More Apologies and anger during fall out from Irish golf society dinnerI am really sorry that I attended and despite the best efforts of people at socially distancing, it should not have happened, the chief executive of the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland said.

It comes after this week’s A-level results changes that mean many students will be awarded higher teacher assessed grades. As a result universities will have to offer additional places with Queens University Belfastsaying it may need up to , extra. That will necessitate the lting of the maximum student numberscap. However, at yesterdays Economy Committee meeting at Stormont, Derry MLAs Gary Middleton and Sinead McLaughlin raised concerns thatthe correct decisions arent made it could lead to further regional imbalance with more students enrolling in Belfast courses. googletag.cmd.push DUP MLA Gary Middleton said there are several hundred unfilled places at Magee. While, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said thatUlster University wants to see growth at Magee it has to be engineered through the relocation of courses and the university has to invest in the marketing of the campus. The Department for the Economycontrols the number of undergraduate places available at QUB and Ulster Universityfor students from NI and those from outside the UK. Both institutions are allowed to accept between ,-, new undergraduates from Northern Ireland every year The cap exists in Northern Ireland in order to keep tuition fee costs down but results in huge competition for places. googletag.cmd.push It also means that on some courses NI students are expected to get higher grades than their counterparts applying from Great Britain. Derry politicians have called for the MaSN cap to be lted to allow universities to accommodate more students. They’ve insisted that the Magee campus should be prioritised, citing long-promised expansion to , students. However, it is courses that will determine demand and in turn additional places. A UU spokesperson said that it envisages increased demand for Magee courses such as Computer Sciences, Articial Intelligence and Personalised Medicine. She commented: “At Ulster University, students are our absolute priority and we will be as flexible as possible in order to accommodate the maximum number of students possible within our existing funding and the additional flexibility already provided by Department for the Economy. “We are actively preparing for the anticipated additional demand by building in additional places for some of our most popular courses including Computer Sciences, Articial Intelligence, Engineering, Law, Accounting, and Personalised Medicine. “To avail of these additional places, we urge students to contact us as soon as possible on    to discuss your options with an advisor.” The DfE pointed out that responsibility for MaSN allocation lies with Higher Education institutions. A spokesperson for the DfE said: “Until the local universities have received access to the full range of revised grades for all applicant students, they will not be able to confirm places for students or otherwise. “As such, until this process has been completed, there is no way of assessing the number of any additional HE places there may be, nor what the impact might be for each HE institution with regards to their respective MaSNs.” She added: “With regards to the MaSN cap, it is allocated on an institutional-level basis and relates to all full-time undergraduate NI and EU domiciled students it is for each institution to decide how to allocate its MaSN across both subject areas and campuses. “The Economy Minister has stated thatshe will be working with Executive colleagues to ensure that additional places and extra resources are put in place to support universities as soon as possible. “Enrolments for previous years are available athttps:www.economy-ni.gov.uk articles higher-education-enrolments”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There were plenty of smiles, but despite the blistering sunshine, the atmosphere was slightly muted. In any normal year there would have been giddy excitement, pupils slapping congratulations into each others backs. But this is education in a pandemic. The Class of  have already missed out on so much. Their final year was abruptly cut short in March, with the footballers of St Patricks on the brink of a MacRory Cup Final. From March until June in your final year of school may be peak time for exam cramming, but its also a coming-of-age period for young students. googletag.cmd.push Relationships with staff gradually takes on a more collegial feel. There is almost a feeling of being in the trenches together as they prepare together for the exams. Amid our A-Levels, myself and a friend were, not particularly diligently, preparing for a History exam that was set to take place the following day. We had nipped into the shop on the way up from Coleraine town centre and bought a sticky toffee pudding on a whim. The product required heating. Mr Bob Murphy was the most likely to do the needful for us, but when he took a look at the pair of us outside the staff room, he was exasperated. googletag.cmd.push “Boys, this is Mrs McGoldricks exam..” he began. We explained that we were grand for the exam, but would he mind heating up our dessert for us  He came back with a smile and a shake of the head, but with a freshly warmed pudding in hand. Trivial, farcical moments like that are recalled much more easily than any time spent in the exam hall, but s pupils have been denied both academic and pastoral build-up to these milestone exams. They have been disenfranchised, denied ownership of what, in many cases, is a le-changing four months. You cant cram for an exam that isnt happening. Every teacher and school leader Ive spoken to over the last week has highlighted the March to June period as a key moment in exam preparation. Pupils look at how things are going, andthe picture doesnt look great, they know its time to up the ante. Its the sprint at the end of the marathon. Principal Mrs Brenda Mussen addresses the St Patricks College, Maghera, Class of . Weirs decision yesterday afternoon to revert back to teacher predictions on AS and A results is a welcome move, but one that should have come without a four-day delay. The algorithm that would have decided the immediate future of our young people was particularly harsh on comprehensive schools. To use just the previous two years as a benchmark was unfair, particularly given the huge range in results a mixed ability cohort can throw up in any given year. Given the nature of academic selection, the risk of having a below-par set of results in a grammar school is greatly reduced, meaning the system used is already subject to in-built injustice. Results are now back in the hands of teachers and schools, rather than at the mercy of a mathematical equation. Back in the hands of the people who know the pupils. The people best-placed to assess their abilities. The people who spent weeks meticulously preparing their centre-assessed grades. “It was a kick in the teeth when you see students who have been downgraded that should not have been ,” said St Patricks Principal, Mrs Brenda Mussen, last week. This years students had been been kicked in the teeth and handed the bill for the dental work. With all exam boards across the UK now awarding on the basis of teacher judgement, the bill has been belatedly waived. The pupils of County Derry, and the whole of the country, would have been at a competitive disadvantage through no fault of their own. Reverting to teacher predictions for A-Level results at least creates a more level playing field for this years university intake.The writing has been on the wall since last Thursday. It took until yesterday for the Minister to bother to read it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A memorial plaque erected by Derry City Council in . Nigel Henderson, a researcher with History Hub Ulster, has been documenting the locations of the , ex-servicemen’s cottages built in Northern Ireland. “The largest colony or collection of cottages in County Londonderry are the ones at Messines Park,” he told the County Derry Post. “I’ve been going through the records trying to get details of the styles of the houses, how many rooms they had, whether they had toilets and bathrooms and things like that. “Once a family was installed in them, they tended to stay there for le, but there were some issues with evictions due to non-payment of rent. “A lot of the guys coming back from the war weren’t able to keep up employment so they may not have been able to pay the rents. “The rents weren’t exorbitant for their time or the standard of the houses, but the ISSLT , were strict at taking people to court for non-payment of rent. “You had guys who were evicted in the early s and then another ex-serviceman might have moved in again. In Belfast, there were guys on the waiting list as far on as the s.” Early plans show the layout of the ex-servicemens three-bedroom cottages at Messines Park. Initial rent for the houses, designed by Roland Ingolby Smith, chief architect for the NI Ministry of Finance from  to , was nine shillings per week, around £ per week today. On the night the Luftwaffe bombed the city, all  fatalities occurred in a row of houses facing onto the Buncrana Road. Nigel Henderson said the attack on Messines Park was unlikely to have been in the Germans’ plan. Instead, it is thought the nearby docks were their intended target. “What I understand is that they were aiming for the docks. During the Second World War in Derry, there was a naval base there,” he said. “It was a base for the Royal Navy going out on patrols in the North Atlantic, but they overshot and Shantallow was not that far from where the docks would have been. Ten members from the Richmond and Murray families died in the attack, along with -year-old James Collins, his -year-old daughter Ellen and William Alexander McFarland. The youngest victim was -month-old Sheila Murray. Their loss was keenly felt within Messines Park, where a strong community spirit had grown since the houses were erected in June .

A colony of ex-servicemen being settled in Derry has the potential to be controversial when looked at through a contemporary eye, but an atmosphere of co-operation prevailed in the aftermath of the First World War. “I don’t think there was any sectarian sentiment against the houses, because for the guys who had moved in, religious affiliation was not a factor,” explained Nigel. “What was taken into account was how big a family they had, whether they had employment, whether they were wounded or gassed in the war, or the standard of housing they had. “Some of those who died were Protestants and some were Roman Catholics and because it was on the edge of the city, they formed almost a small community of their own. “The attitude was that it didn’t matteryou were a Catholic or a Protestant, a unionist or a nationalist, the guys served together. Both communities had been up for participating. “When those guys came home, the religious affiliation of their ex-servicemen neighbours would not have been a major factor or a cause for concern. “They had served together through a nightmare and living close to other ex-servicemen provided an opportunity for them to talk about their shared experiences. “This was something the veterans seldom did inside their homes or with their families.” While not their intended target, the German bombers would no doubt have felt a sense of schadenfreude at how things panned out. Nigel Henderson is struck by the tragic irony of the ex-servicemen’s demise. “It’s the only part of Derry that was hit in the German air raids, but it just happened to be men who had fought in the First World War who were the principal victims,” he said. “That is the irony of it. They survived the Germans in the trenches of the First World War to then die during the Second World War from aerial bombing.” The victims James and Ellen Collins Father and daughter, James and Ellen Collins, lived at  Messines Park. Sixty-year old James was the oldest victim of the bombing and was originally from Eglinton.

Lissan conceded their first game to Drumsurn and last week surrendered from a position of strength against Doire Trasna. Shea McKernan had the ball in the net within minutes of the start, getting on the end of a slick passing movement to slot home. Rather than building it, eight first half wides was the story of Kieran OKanes young sides exploits. For all their shortcomings, they were well in contention and led by two points, with eight minutes to go. googletag.cmd.push Disaster struck when Stephen Conway, who made a fine first half save from Ciaran McGowan, shanked a kick-out to Eoghan Quigg who passed for Micheaacutel McNaught to strike a hammer blow to the net they never recovered from. At midfield for Lissan is the towering Conor Loane, an All-Ireland winning goalkeeper with Holy Trinity Cookstown, and MacRory Cup medallist Mattie Loughran, who kicked four points last week. The pair dovetailed well together and in Iarlaith Donaghy, they have one of the most exciting players in the county playing at number six. Defender Oran Donnelly wears , but sits back as a sweeper, with the nimble Joey Quinn playing up front with Tiarnach Donaghy. googletag.cmd.push Coming Lissans way this weekend is a Faughanvale side who have posted two wins from as many games and had a tough battle to overcome a Drumsurn side who arguably deserved a draw. Manager Joe Gray has had to come to terms with long-term injuries to Oisin Quinn and Jordan Curran. Michael McLaughlin spent last summer in America, but he is back and forms an inside forward duo with Kevin Martin. Paddy OKane is one of their key players and Lissan may face a kick-back after his quiet outing in the last round. He played off the front two, but their running game almost bypassed their middle sector. Gordon Fahey and Michael Sweeney are a formidable defensive spine, with skipper Conor McGuinness nestled between them as a sweeper - a formation that will mirror the Lissan setup,both managers adopt the same approach this time around. The Vale will also have questions to answer. When Drumsurn went down to  men, Grays side couldnt get their hands on the ball and had to rely on a strong finish. On the flip side, apart from the one they scored, the Vale carved out the best two goal chances over the course of the game. A tough ask for Lissan who cant finish above the bottom. Kieran OKane will have his side well-prepared, but Faughanvale will be fancied to come through. VERDICT: Faughanvale RELATEDJoe Grays reaction to the Vales win over Drumsurn.

Ciaran McFaul came back into the team and got Glen off the mark. In a tight first half, Oisin Mullan opened the Shamrocks account after five minutes. Emmet Bradley edged Glen ahead, but they lost Conor Convery to a black card after  minutes. Three frees from the boot of Ryan Bell and a nice score from open play from Connor Nevin kept Ballinderry in contention. Paul Gunning, Jack Doherty and a fisted Danny Tallon effort helped Glen, who missed three early goal chances, into a - to - interval lead. googletag.cmd.push Ryan Bell, from an advanced mark, was on target for Ballinderry on the restart, but was forced off with reports of a hamstring injury. Connor Carville, Emmet Bradley and Jack Doherty had Glen four points clear after  minutes. Ballinderry replied with points from Conor ONeill, Matt Quinn and Sean Graham on his debut. Glen finished out the game with points from Gunningand the Doherty brothers – Alex and Jack. Magherafelt -Banagher -An early goal from Niall Higgins put champions Magherafelt on their way to victory at Banagher, to secure second in the group. The story of the game for Rossa was theof Michael McEvoy to the side, when he came in for Jared Monaghan to make his first appearance since last seasons Larkin Cup. googletag.cmd.push In the first attack of the game, Conor Kearns direct ball found Higgins, who turned inside two defenders before slotting across goalkeeper McDermott to the bottom corner of the net. Kearns came forward to kick a point from the wing, with Shane Heavron burling a fine score to help Adrian Cushs side into a - to - point by half-time, with Niall Moore among Banangers first half scorers. Midway through the second half, Magherafelt struck for their second goal. Danny Hearvons high ball to brother Shane was broken loose and Emmett McGuckin pulled on the ball to the net, for a - to - lead. Conor Feeney and Shane Heavron, his sixth of the day, rounded off the scoring and they now await the draw for the main event in September.

Education Minister Peter Weir yesterday announced a u-turn on results, with all pupils now to be given the higher of the grades submitted by their centre or the grade calculated by CCEA Over a third of all AS and A grades given to students by teachers had been originally downgraded by CCEAs standardisation system last week in a move which drew critcisim from schools, parents and pupils. One County Derry school saw  percent of its results downgraded. Their principal, who wished to remain anonymous, said the system is flawed. googletag.cmd.push “The actual child was taken out of the entire process,” they told the County Derry Post. “Education reports always say, the child is at the centre of all that we do. This system took the child out of the equation and everyone became a number and a statistic. “Nobody sat down and worked out our grades. This is an algorithim or some way of putting all the data into a computer and spewing it back out again.“No heed was paid to teachers professional judgement. the child has been taken out of the equation – and it was a mathematical equation.” The way in which schools previous performance was factored into the process had also caused controversy, with many feeling pupils at comprehensive schools are at a further disadvantage. googletag.cmd.push Having seen a dip in one particular subject the previous year, the affected school poured efforts into rectying the situation, only to see their work negated by the standardisation system. “In one subject this time last year we were devastated [with the results]. If I sat with my arms folded, we would have got the same results this year,” said the Principal. “Those who were sitting looking at our estimated grades and our AS Level grades from the bad situation, dont know what we were doing all year to turn it around. “We were moving mountains to change the situation that CCEA used for that particular subject. “Theyve used the history of subjects. Ours is a high achieving school. One year a child came to us in third year, with no English, and achieved ten A* grades. Does that mean thatthat child had been doing those exams the way they were done this year, they wouldnt have got the ten A* grades, because we had no history of that  “Theyve said, we cant give them four As in Maths, because theyve never had four As in Maths. Does that mean that every year, a child doesnt get the opportunity to get an A  “Specically with our school, they had brought our percentage to  percent. We have never, in the history of A-Levels here, got  percent. So how did they come to that conclusion ” There was criticism also of CCEAs handling of the appeal process and its associated advice. The school only received official advice on the appeals process at .pm on the evening the results came out. “I received guidance on how to write an appeal at .pm. I was at home. We walked out of here yesterday with all our appeals all done and we got that at home” said the Principal. “Nobody can explain why these people have been pulled down. They gave us a webinar on Tuesday before the results came out as a background to how theyve reached the conclusion. “You can have all the webinars you like, butyoure going to disadvantage children, Im going to be shouting, and were not the only school. “We had plenty of good results too, but its the fact that they changed so many pupils. CCEA are saying it was a third that were changed. “If they hadchanged a third of ours, I would not be on the phone to you now, but they have taken  percent of our pupils down. “They were utterly devastated. We have children who looked at a screen last week that said they were unsuccessful in their attempt to get into their university choice. “We spent two full weeks in lockdown sorting out these centre-assessed grades. We might as well not have bothered.” Related: COMMENT: Belated U-turn should have come last week  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I am very proud that our incoming head boy, Cormac Savage, was at the forefront of this campaign and believe his contribution was pivotal in ensuring that the sense of injustice and unfairness felt by his peers was articulated in a forceful and timely manner.Mr McCann also welcomed confirmation that GCSE grades will be awarded as calculated by schools.ldquoTeachers were asked to exercise professional judgment and engaged in a robust process to ensure that pupil effort and attainment in the period from September  to the unexpected and unprecedented closing of schools in March was rewarded, he said. ldquoA great deal of time and energy was devoted to this task by the staff of St. Patrickrsquos Grammar to ensure that grades were awarded fairly and consistently.Down High principal Maud Perry, said after the initial publication of results last Thursday the school was celebrating its best ever A-Level achievements.ldquoThis was unsurprising, as this particular year group achieved the schoolrsquos best ever AS results last year, she said.ldquoThis was a very dferent year in so many ways, but Down High pupils continue to be among the best qualied of their generation and, beyond the curriculum, our pupils are enriched, socially confident and ready to take their place as leaders of the future in whatever fields they choose. Congratulations to all of the pupils on these fully deserved grades.Shimna Integrated College principal Kevin Lambe congratulated the schoolrsquos ldquowonderful A level students who weathered the storm of this unprecedented year.He said he was delighted that the vast majority of students had already been placed at their first choice of university before the restoration of the teacher assessed grades on Monday afternoon.Mr Lambe said that while there had been considerable controversy about the process of awarding grades this year, he paid tribute to the excellent guidance document CCEA provided and to the commitment and energy his staff brought to the grading process.ldquoI am quite sure that the moderation process was undertaken in good faith, but it caused dreadful damage and heartache across the country, he said. ldquoThe CCEA guidance was sound, the work of teachers was thoroughgoing, the teacher awarded grades were the right ones and I am absolutely delighted that they have been restored.Ballynahinchrsquos Assumption Grammar School said it was delighted with the government U-turn in awarding grades as the original process ldquocaused signicant emotional upheaval which affected students, parents and our staff.ldquoWe are fortunate in that over % of our A students had already accessed their chosen university or workplace and hope that now almost every girl has achieved their true potential and will be able to access a iety of career pathways. Assumption Girls set the highest of standards year on year and we are proud of our Year  Girls who excelled in every subject at every level, said a school statement.ldquoOur AS students now have a solid foundation of grades which will give them the confidence to believe in their own potential to achieve at the highest of levels as they enter A level. We wish our GCSE girls the best of luck for tomorrowrsquos results.Castlewellanrsquos St Malachyrsquos High School said it was pleased with Education Minister Peter Weirrsquos announcement that AS and A level students will receive their centre assessment grades or the grade awarded by the examining body, whichever is higher.ldquoWe continue to work hard in St Malachyrsquos in the best interests of all our young people, said a statement issued on Monday evening. We are all here in St Malachyrsquos to help and support our students in the best way we can. Congratulations on their wonderful achievements we wish them all the very best in the future.De La Salle High School principal Ciaran Maguire described the past academic year for students as ldquochallenging.He said students adhered to social distancing guidelines collecting their results last Thursday, with the school delighted with their overall grades.ldquoA-Level results across the province has been one of confusion and uncertainty, said Mr Maguire.ldquoWe as a school were relieved that the majority of the teacher assessment grades were secured for our pupils and will continue to appeal and challenge those that need to be addressed to ensure that all pupils get the right outcome, allowing them to progress in an ever changing world.Before Mondayrsquos announcement, Mr Mark Morgan, principal at St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, said the continued year on year improvement in grades from the students appeared to have been curtailed by the examination bodies.He said teacher predicted grades, which were in line with all the tracking data, appeared to have been totally ignored and grades were given that bore no reflection to the historic and contemporaneous standard attained by students at the school.St Maryrsquos High School in Downpatrick congratulated its A-Level and AS-Level students who received their results.The school said the studentsrsquo success was a ldquoreflection of their hard work, determination to succeed and dedicated teaching staff who always go the extra mile.ldquoOur steady, upward trend in examination results has continued this year and we wish our students all the very best as they begin their studies at university, the statement added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 53.jpg","title":"53 dogs put down in past year – one third of all in NI  ","story":"A LOCAL politician says she is ldquoheartbroken that more dogs being put to sleep in Newry, Mourne and Down than any other council area in Northern Ireland.Fty-three dogs were destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down in - out of a total of  for the whole province.Thatrsquos almost twice as many as the next highest area, which is Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon with .By contrast six councils reported single figure death rates, while not a single dog was put to sleep in Ards and North Down.Rowallane area councillor Kathryn Owen says the figure for Newry, Mourne and Down makes for ldquogrim reading.Cllr Owen, who has four dogs, says the council should look to the successful measures being implemented in other council areas.ldquoTo say Irsquom heartbroken about the immense number of dogs destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down District would be an understatement, she said.ldquoThis is not a statistic that we should be proud of.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.Ms Armstrong said the local community previously stood together to save Exploris and would do so again.She added: ldquoI would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal for Belfast could create more than  full-time jobs and would be the biggest attraction of its kind on the island of Ireland, with city planners recommending that the new development should be given the green light.The firm behind it, reefLIVE, says around  to  jobs could be created during its construction, with  full-time posts created when it opens its doors, subject to securing planning approval.The aquarium would be a two-storey building, based across more than , sq ft and include a cafe, coral reef ocean tank, with the main exhibition space across five zones on the first floor ndash themed as Ireland, Deep Ocean, Azores, Pacic and Arctic.Around  representations were received in relation to the planning application, including  letters of objection.Concerns included the impact to traffic and travel, the impact on heritage for both listed buildings and monuments, flooding and the potential negative impact on the Exploris aquarium in Portaferry.Those behind the planned tourist attraction say it is anticipated the reefLIVE Aquarium will be the largest marine-le visitor attraction on the island of Ireland and in bringing another international-standard attraction to the Titanic Quarter, would help to boost theof tourist visits to the city.In recommending the scheme for approval, Belfast City Council planners said that ldquohaving regard to the development plan and other material considerations, including the issues raised by the representation, the proposal is considered and approval of planning permission is recommended with delegated authority given to the director of planning and building control to finalise the wording of conditions subject to no new substantive planning issues being raised by third parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 Celebrations.jpg","title":"Celebrations to mark the end of WW2  ","story":"CHURCH bells rang out across Killyleagh on Saturday morning to mark the th anniversary of VJ Day.The bells of St Johnrsquos Church of Ireland were tolled as part of the UK-wide commemorations of the anniversary.The day when the Second World War finally ended was celebrated with a short interdenominational act of remembrance at the War Memorial.At am former Army chaplain Hector Wanliss gave a ure reading and led prayers of thanksgiving for the men of Killyleagh, Shrigley and district who went to war, and for peace.Then Last Post and Reveille were sounded by Ronnie Cromie and Wilmer Cromie before two minutesrsquo silence was observed and Binyonrsquos Lines were recited by Billy Croskery, the chairman of Killyleagh and Killinchy Royal British Legion.A wreath was then laid by Mr Croskery, who was escorted by Kevin Kelly.Sadly Killyleaghrsquos last remaining Second World War veteran, Martin `Tinarsquo Charters, who is aged , was not able to take part on this occasion.Social distancing measures were in place and the organisers are grateful for those who attended adhering to these.It was a timely reminder that the main highlight of the year, the Killyleagh VE  celebrations, had to be cancelled in May by the Killyleagh Remembers the War group in the wake of the Coronavirus alert and the danger of public gatherings.The Killyleagh group has now cancelled its next proposed event, a lecture on the Second World War in the library due to be given by author George Busby on September .ldquoWe will be keeping under review the remaining schedule of the programme, in conjunction with the Heritage Lottery Fund.

It develops strength and endurance. Through dancing, a toddler will learn from the early age about what their bodies are capable of, she says.ldquo At the same time, it will build their curiosity as naturally they will experiment with certain movements. If toddlers have been introduced to dancing since early age, the chance of them developing good kinesthetic memory is increased.ldquoDuring class we work on key skills such as counting and sequencing thus subtlety engaging with numeracy and literacy.

This time Ardal McMahon provided the finish as they reached the water break.The RGU management team were left with plenty to ponder. Downpatrick continued to battle after the resumption, determined not to be hit by the threat of an avalanche of Rostrevor scores.At this stage there looked to be a real danger that Rostrevor would cut loose. To their credit, Downpatrick did not throw in the towel.Caolan Mooney burst through on the Downpatrick goal not long before half-time and a penalty was awardedwhen he was up-ended by goalkeeper Deeny. Shaun Parr stepped up and netted Rostrevorrsquos third goal.Downpatrick were given a glimmer of hope just before the interval when Parr and then Sean Cooper were black-carded.However at half-time, and the score at - to -, Downpatrickrsquos task looked onerous.The RGU came out with the right attitude to mount a revival in the second half and Doylersquos early minor reduced the gap.Chris Magee helped lead the Downpatrick forward linersquos continuing assaults on the Rostrevor goal with a couple of scores. And there emerged a real feeling of optimism amongst the massed Downpatrick ranks when Conor McGradyrsquos point left just two in it.However Rostrevor refused to hit the panic button. Guided by the experience of Mooney, they stretched their lead before the next water break.Downpatrick were awarded a penalty with the scoreboard reading - to -. However when Rostrevor needed a big moment at just the right time, goalkeeper Gareth Clarke provided it, plunging to push Tim Prenterrsquos effort to safety.That was the moment which really deflated Downpatrickrsquos resolve. You sensed that Rostrevor knew they had weathered the best that Downpatrick could summon in response to their deficit.Jordan Fegan then broke away in the closing minutes, before splitting the posts and taking Rostrevorrsquos score to -.Kane applied a classy coup de grace with the final score of the evening for the victors when he spun the Downpatrick defence and, bearing down on goal, took the safe option of landing the point.In the end it looked plain sailing on paper for Rostrevor. Certainly in terms of the opening they made to the match, catching the RGU cold, they laid the foundations early that kept many of the worries away that Downpatrick could spring a result on them.To Downpatrickrsquos credit, after that disappointing early start, there were more than enough signs there that the spirit within the camp to dig in and get themselves out of trouble in games is there.Downpatrick: James Deeny, Paddy Smith, Ronan Murphy, Eoin Rooney, Nathan McShane, Gerdie Collins, Conor Doherty, Damian Turley, Jonny Bell, Tim Prenter , Conor McGrady , Conor McCarron , Ruairi Quinn , Peter Turley , Chris Magee .Subs: Jarlath Brannigan , Morgan Fitzpatrick, Caolan Boyd, Damian Branf, Daniel McCarron, Garrett Trainor, Ruairi Og Quinn, Frank Starkey, Tom Savage, Tim Collins, Aidan McNeill, Con Farrell, Aidan Og Robinson.Rostrevor: Gareth Clarke, Jarlath Farrell, Tomas Gordon, Eoin Murdock, Nicky Murray, Colm Murney, James Donaghy, Sean Cooper, Caolan Mooney , Ardghal McMahon , Jordan Fegan , Patrick Magee, Conor Doyle , Shaun Parr, Piaras Kane .Subs: Paul McGrath, Richie Reynolds, Darren McElhinney, Conall Gordon, Eamon McConville.

It was a near mathematical certainty that we would get bad summer weather.Average hours of annual sunshine in Northern Ireland are roughly the same from year to year .

The weather in Northern Ireland was oustanding in April and May, which meant some form of payback was due in terms of lots of dull summer days, writes Ben Lowry. Picture: Michael CooperAnd sure enough we suffered payback. July was the dullest in NI in more than  years, according to Armagh Observatory. It was also wetter and cooler than average.August has been poor, particularly the last week. I associate late August with the onset of autumn.While the Mediterranean gets hot weather into October and southern England is warm until late September, Northern Ireland summers end early.My late uncle rented a house on the north coast in the last week of each August. I have happy memories of those trips but not of the weather. It has been wet across Britain and Ireland over the last week, such as at the Front Strand in Youghal, Co. Cork above on Wednesday.

There were growing reports of teenage parties after this time, because there is only so long that people will accept massive restrictionsThe chief medical officer for Northern Ireland, Dr Michael Maguire, said he would recommend such sweeping restrictionsCovid- infections hit  people per , .Robin Swann, the health minister, also gave warning that ato lockdown could not be ruled out,cases keep rising.Dr McBride, as a health official who lacks an elected mandate, was careful to say that it was not ultimately his call. He said that any recommendations would “need to go to the executive at the appropriate time for them to make a decision”. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...That is the traditional protocol. Now, however, western world politicians often defer big decisions to committees or experts, rather than make hard choices themselves.Even the supposedly radical Tory government in London, whichwants to shake up how the UK is governed, has hidden its pandemic decision making behind scientists.The A Level-GCSE fiasco is rooted in the cowardice that led to UK schools being shut earlier than the government wanted, and staying closed for longer.Even now teaching unions and other voices are trying to stop a fullto school next month, when in fact there should have been a push to get pupils back in the weeks after Easter– or at least exam years.There are four broad reasons why ato anything like the general lockdown we experienced after March  is not plausible.• The first is that the nation can’t afford to sustain the furlough schemeIt has already pushed debt to perilous levels. If furlough was extended into next year, there would need to be massive tax increases and spending cuts, including public sector pay cuts .NI politicians have no stomach for such toughness. Even in a financial crisis, Stormont seems only ever inclined to grant pay rises, including a huge recent teacher rise. Councils abused furlough by topping up Treasury funding of % of salaries with ratepayer cash to ensure no staff had any pay reduction.• The second reason lockdown is not feasible is the public mood. The UK government has been fairly criticised for the many things it did wrong over Covid, but few people cite thingsit got right. Its behavioural experts saidlockdown came in too early people would get fed up after a while, and begin to break it. That began to happen after two months. In June there were growing reports of young people socialising in groups .As well as fatigue with restrictions, people began to develop an instinctive sense of the risk of Covid, similar to how we assess car travel .• The third reason lockdown is not feasible is that infection levels do not justy such a massive response.Even the level cited by Dr McBride –  per , cases – is low according to some experts. Prof Carl Heneghan of Oxford’s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine said epidemic level is five times higher .He said people were failing to understand, and balance, risks.Mr Swann and Dr McBride have accepted such balance over schooling .But such balancing equations should be applied more widely .Few politicians are candid that the Covid risk cannot be cut to zero.Sweden’s former state epidemiologist Prof Johan Giesecke said from the outset that it was not possible to halt Covid’s spread. Recent upsurges in case even in nations that were seen as models of control, such as Germany and South Korea, have vindicated that prediction. • The fourth reason another lockdown is not feasible is specic to NI: Bobby Storey’s funeral shattered Stormont’s authority. There was a cross-party determination to protect Sinn Fein . This meant the first and deputy first ministers cannot preside over press briefings that might reveal suspension of liberty.Instead, the political parties erted attention from the calculating nature of SF leaders’ social distancing breach on June  in westBelfast by backing probes into important but secondary matters such as PSNI and Belfast council handling of the funeral. But in the absence of sanction against hypocritical leaders who set the rules, the damage is irreparable. A population that for months largely obeyed lockdown, including missing funerals of loved ones, watched as republicans were allowed to do as they pleased.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: Autumn in Northern Ireland always seems to arrive in late August——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I was a mere child then and childhood dreams develop realism as time moves on.The family home eventually became too small for us and we moved on, but not far away. My mother pined to get back to the area which she eventually did by which time I had left school, had started working and soon that meant living away from home except for the Christmas holidays. That was the one time of the year you could be guaranteed to escape what we called the midges or mayflies, to give them their proper title, harmless little blighters but a great nuisance. And this year, particularly this month, it seems, those mayflies are ‘torturing‘ the locals because August is the month of the mayfly andit’s a good, warm month they breed in their zillions.I remember having to close up bedroom windows at night andI went to visit my elderly Aunt Lizzie, who lived right on the shore at Ballyronan, she kept a permanently rolled up newspaper which she took everywhere with her.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Her laneway was fairly long and when I visited I always dreaded having to cycle though this buzzing throng with mouth closed and breath held until I could reach her front door.The mayflies first arrive in May but this balmy warm August, has been particularly perfect weather for the second generation of little blighters on all shores of the lough. Barbeques  Out of the question. Strolling around the shore on a calm evening  Forget it. The mayflies cover the walls of houses and the windows, for all the world resembling a black plague. My mother would spend her mornings shovelling them away from the doors and windows yes, even those that got inside. When the well-known McGarry Brothers were building boats on the shore not far from BallyronanI recall seeing the dead flies stacked high in their boatyard, the perfect dung heap for locals keen for valuable free compost for their gardens.Tennis, GAA matches, even paddling on the shore was out of the question when the flies took over.The sadness of it all is that most parts of the shores of Lough Neagh are scenically beautul and understandably people want to build homes there. Those who haven’t done their homework and have built a home overlooking the water will get a shock when the first tranche of mayflies arrive.These creatures spread themselves over everything including the highest trees. Fly killing sprays are useless. They come, set up home and don’t die off or go away until it suits them. And, it was that that persuaded me that no matter how much I loved the place I could never live there. I wasn’t even keen to visit the family home until the flies had gone.I try to avoid driving in the area when the mayflies are active as they splatter the windscreen ruining your vision and needing to be scraped off because they harden like glue. Step ouside the car and you’re covered in them.In sense they are not unlike the coronavirus – a first tranche arrives taking lives and scaring us witless. We try to get it under control only for a second lot to move in or at least we have been told to expect one. Even our scientists are fairly certain the virus willwith the cold weather. Our Health Minister Robin Swann has us well warned. So the police needed go looking for beach parties or illegal raves around the shores of Lough Neagh. The mayfly, though harmless, is a thorough pest which comes and goes as it pleases.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It says: “The current global pandemic means that there are no risk-free options, but it is important that parents and teachers understand the balance of risks to achieve the best course of action for their children.ChildrenWe are confident that multiple sources of evidence show that a lack of schooling increases inequalities, reduces the le chances of children and can exacerbate physical and mental health issues. School improves health, learning, socialisation and opportunities throughout the le course including employment. It has not been possible to reduce societal inequalities through the provision of home-based education alone. School attendance is very important for children and young people.Live samples in test tubes are held in a containerWe are confident in the extensive evidence that there is an exceptionally small risk of children of primary or secondary school age dying from COVID-. The infection fatality ratefor those aged  to  is estimated at  per million, lower than for most seasonal flu infections. Every death of a child is a tragedy but COVID- deaths in children and teenagers are fortunately extremely rare and almost all deaths are in children with signicant pre-existing health conditions.We are confident that there is clear evidence of a very low rate of severe disease in children of primary and secondary school ages compared to adults, eventhey catch COVID-. The percentage of symptomatic cases requiring hospitalisation is estimated to be .% for children aged  to  and .% among those aged  to , compared to a hospitalisation rate of over % in the UK for the general population. Most of these children make a rapid recovery.We are confident that there is clear evidence from many studies that the great majority of children and teenagers who catch COVID- have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.There is reasonable, but not yet conclusive, evidence that primary school age children have a signicantly lower rate of infection than adults .Evidence that older children and teenagers are at lower risk of catching COVID- is mixed. They are either less likely to catch COVID- than adults or have the same risk as adults.Transmission of COVID- to children in schools does occur. On current evidence it is probably not a common route of transmission. It may be lower in primary age children than secondary age children.Control measures such as hand and surface hygiene, cohorting to reduce number of daily contacts, and directional controls to reduce face-to-face contact remain key elements of maintaining COVID- secure school environments and minimising risk.Children and young people who were previously shielding were identied on a precautionary basis at a stage when we had less data on the effects of COVID- in children than we do now. Based on our better understanding of COVID- the great majority have now been advised they do not need to do so again, and that they shouldto school. A small number of children under paediatric carehave been or will be given inidual advice about any ongoing need to avoid infection.Our overall consensus is that, compared to adults, children may have a lower risk of catching COVID- , definitely have a much lower rate of hospitalisation and severe disease, and an exceptionally low risk of dying from COVID-. Very few,any, children or teenagers will come to long-term harm from COVID- due solely to attending school. This has to be set against a certainty of long-term harm to many children and young people from not attending school.Teachers, other school staff and parentsData from the UKsuggest teachers are not at increased risk of dying from COVID- compared to the general working-age population. ONS data identies teaching as a lower risk profession . International data support this.Transmission of COVID- to staff members in school does occur, and data from UK and international studies suggest it may largely be staff to staffrather than pupil to staff. This reinforces the need to maintain social distancing and good infection control inside and outside classroom settings, particularly between staff members and between older children and adults.If teachers, other school staff, parents or wider family catch COVID- their risks of severe illness are similar to those of other adults of the same age, ethnicity and health status. Younger adults have a much lower risk of severe COVID- than older adults. The greatest risk is to those over  years old.Current international evidence suggests transmission of COVID- from children of school age to parents or other adult family members is relatively rare compared to transmission from adults, but this evidence is weak. Teenagers may be more likely to transmit to adults than younger children.Children and young people should be engaged in the process of establishing COVID- secure measures as key participants and promoters of safe communities to help protect their wider families, teachers and other school staff and other social networks. This will help reduce the risk of school outbreaks.Impact of opening schools on wider transmission Because schools connect households it is likely opening schools will put some upward pressure on transmission more widely and therefore increase R. We have confidence in the current evidence that schools are much less important in the transmission of COVID- than for influenza or some other respiratory infections. Other work and social environments also increase risk and are likely to be more important for transmission of COVID-.The international real-world evidence suggests that reopening of schools has usually not been followed by a surge of COVID- in a timescale that implies schools are the principal reason for the surge. There has, however, not been sufficient time to say this with confidence.On the other hand, a local or national surge in transmission in the community may lead to an increased risk of school outbreaks occurring.Opening schools may be as important in linking households indirectly as through direct transmission in school. For example allowing parents to go back to work, or meeting at the school gates, on public transport or in shared private vehicles, via after school social or sport activities or wrap-around care may be as important as what happens within the school.It is possible that opening schools will provide enough upward pressure on R that it goes above  having previously been below it, at least in some local areas. This will require local action and could mean societal choices that weigh up the implications of imposing limitations on dferent parts of the community and the economy.Early identication and quickly managing outbreaks of COVID- in schools is essential as part of a local response to COVID-. Clear advice for pupils and staff not to attend school with symptoms, and prompt availability of testing, appropriate isolation advice, and careful public health surveillance and monitoring of educational establishments are key to support the safeto schools”.Earlier it was revealed that the number of PSNI officers now affected by COVID- is now .A Tweet this afternoon said: “Update from ACC Todd in relation to Covid- and our officers. The number of officers who are currently self-isolating and undergoing testing for Covid- has increased from  yesterday to  officers today”.The news comes as a servive took place for tragic Andreea Maftei in Ballymena.The -year-old who had worked in Nobel cafe in Ballymena dies last week.Today her family and friends gathered to say their final goodbyesTributes were paid to Andreea last week and flowers were placed outside the cafe alongside candles.A notice on the James Henry Funeral Services social media page said: “Andreea Maftei, th August , passed away suddenly at Antrim Area Hospital after a short illness aged .‘Late of  Ballyloughan Park, Ballymena.

For those who believe they are immune they need to know better.

All children in Wales have had the opportunity to lsquocheck in, catch up and preparersquo before the summer holidays, and we hope this will stand them in good stead for the changes they are due to encounter in the upcoming months. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
