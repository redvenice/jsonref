The plan will help save the company $6 billion by 2020, according to GM\u0027Those are good architectures from a fuel economy perspective ... we\u0027ll continue to put those in the market, but we can take down our capital expenditures, while investing in electric and autonomous vehicles,\u0027 said Barra. \u0027You will see a greater share invested in autonomous and electric vehicles, both from a capital expenditure and\u0027 increased hiring for electric and self-driving engineering jobs.In a press statement, the company said it will close the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Plant in Detroit and Warren Transmission Operations in Warren.Other plants closing include the Oshawa Assembly Plant in Oshawa, Ontario, the Lordstown Assembly in Warren, Ohio, and the Baltimore Operations in White Marsh, Maryland.The company also plans to stop building several models now assembled at those plants, including the Chevrolet Cruze, the Cadillac CT6 and the Buick LaCrosse.\u0027The actions we are taking today continue our transformation to be highly agile, resilient and profitable, while giving us the flexibility to invest in the future,\u0027 said GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra.\u0027We recognize the need to stay in front of changing market conditions and customer preferences to position our company for long-term success.\u0027          GM will lay off 14,700 factory and white-collar workers in North America and put five plants up for possible closure as it restructures to cut costs and focus more on autonomous and electric vehicles. One of those closures would be the Oshawa plant in Canada (pictured) The reduction includes 8,100 white-collar workers, some of whom will take buyouts and others who will be laid off. Most of the affected factories build cars that won\u0027t be sold in the US after next year. They could close or they could get different vehicles to build. They will be part of contract talks with the United Auto Workers union next year.About 6,000 factory workers could lose jobs in the US and Canada, although some could transfer to truck plants.The plan will help save the company $6billion by 2020, according to GM. The announcement is the biggest restructuring in North America for the US No. 1 carmaker since its bankruptcy a decade ago. The Monday closure of GM\u0027s plant in Oshawa, Ontario, was confirmed late Sunday by an official familiar with the decision.GM opened its factory in Oshawa, near Toronto, in 1953. The plant is used to make the Cadillac XTS and Chevrolet Impala sedans as well as the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks.The company  has three other sites in the province of Ontario. It is unclear whether they will also be affected GM needs to reshape the company as it shifts its focus to lower emitting hybrid vehicles, technology that is not at the forefront at the Canadian plant.Too many GM factories are devoted to making slow-selling cars and the company can no longer afford to keep them all operating without making some tough decisions. But the political atmosphere might limit realistic choices for the Detroit automaker.           In a press statement, GM officials announced the closure of Lordstown Assembly (pictured) in Warren, Ohio          The company will also close the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Plant (pictured) in DetroitThe company said that the moves will help continue its focus on crossovers, SUVs and trucks. With the move, GM plans to cut 25 per cent of the executive staff and 15 per cent of the salaried and salaried contract staff.\u0027These actions will increase the long-term profit and cash generation potential of the company and improve resilience through the cycle,\u0027 Barra said in the statement.The closure of the Lordstown plant in Ohio didn\u0027t shock some analysts who predicted that location as one of GM\u0027s targets.  The car produced there is also is built in Mexico. The once-bustling factory already has lost two of its three shifts and 3,000 union jobs since the beginning of last year.Barra did not link the cuts announced Monday to tariff pressures, but said trade costs are among the \u0027headwinds\u0027 GM has to face as it deals with broader technology change and market shifts.With US car sales lagging, several car plants have fallen to just one shift, including its Hamtramck and Lordstown, assembly plant. Travel chaos on DC to NYC corridor after Delaware Memorial...Online sales hit a record £4bn on Cyber Monday - as...Share this articleA rule of thumb for the automotive industry is that if a plant is running below 80 per cent of production capacity, it is losing money. GM has several plants running well below that. Consultancy LMC estimates that Lordstown will operate at just 31 per cent of production capacity in 2018. Rivals Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV have both curtailed US car production. Ford said in April it planned to stop building nearly all cars in North America. The industrywide slowdown in passenger car sales started to pick up steam in 2017.The shift by US consumer preferences have been away from passenger cars to larger, more comfortable SUVs and pickup trucks has been swift and severe, leaving automakers scrambling to readjust.As recently as 2012, passenger cars made up more than 50 per cent of all US new vehicle sales. Through the first nine months of 2018, that had fallen to a little over 31 percent.While industry-wide passenger car sales were down 13.2 per cent through the first nine months of the year, pickup truck and SUV sales rose 8.3 per cent. As well as being roomier, the fuel economy on SUVs and crossovers has improved significantly.          Unifor, Canada\u0027s largest private sector union, said in a prepared statement that it does not have complete details of the announcement, but it has been informed that there is no product allocated to the Oshawa plant past December 2019Sales of Cruze, built at Lordstown, fell 27 per cent through September 2018. Impala, which is built at Oshawa and Hamtramck, was down 13 per cent.

It\u0027s what I do - I just drift along with what\u0027s happening.\u0027I think it would be easier for my parents if I lived an ordinary life - they struggle and they worry. But I have never met anyone who gives me a hard time.\u0027People try to get me into the ordinary - it\u0027s hard for people to understand that I don\u0027t want a job or to pay the price for what comes with it.\u0027Generally, if you have a job you are part of the monetary system. I do spend money - but it\u0027s a choice.\u0027I mean, when do you ever really have to spend money? You can always say no.

I don\u0027t think it is very remote really in the sense that people think about remoteness - but its inaccessibility, which I think is appealing.\u0027In 1986 I was working across the loch at the Dundonnel hotel and came over here for a big music festival.\u0027It got too big in the end, the last one was in 1988 when a few thousand came. Some people that live and have lived here have had quite a lot of connections to Glastonbury and other music scenes. \u0027I came over with a guy who was working on the White House over here, it was getting built at the time. \u0027Then he left and I stayed. I realised I\u0027d quite like to be here and started to ask around for places to live. I got offered two places.\u0027It\u0027s by no means idealistic and it has its own hardships of the wind and the rain.\u0027You are exposed to the elements - but that\u0027s good also as you are aware of what the weather is doing all the time and you\u0027re very much in touch with nature and the elements and life.\u0027We\u0027re an ageing population but I guess the bulk of us are between 40 and 65.\u0027There are not so many people that are younger than us, apart from the kids obviously. \u0027I am the post-person three days a week, sub-contracted by the Royal Mail.\u0027I am responsible for everybody\u0027s important post and for transporting it across the loch as dryly and as safely as possible. \u0027I have a sea-taxi business, which runs a regular sea-ferry service, but a lot of people have their own boat and there is also a communal boat.\u0027          Lisa has lived on the peninsula for 23 years and is responsible for the post on the peninsula.

I came here as a couple, with our son, but we have now split up but still both live here.\u0027Every year, I go back to Russia and leave my son with my ex.\u0027I love it because I enjoy the ballet I can do there and I prefer the mentality, the toughness and resilience to change.\u0027Russians have an ability to withstand anything.\u0027          Chisa has lived on the island for five years and said she likes being there as she doesn\u0027t want to be surrounded by other people\u0027s judgementsAggie, 65\u0027The first time I came here, it just felt like home to me. It was November 1975.\u0027It worried me slightly that we moved here as I cannot swim and I had young children.\u0027We needed somewhere to live and it wasn\u0027t enough to put me off as we had the option to walk in and out as well.\u0027I like living here because I like to know where everything comes from, to know myself what the situation is with my electricity and what to do when it goes wrong and the same goes for the water too.\u0027I think we were very lucky to have Hugh come here and do his windmills.\u0027By now, I guess, solar would have come in if wind hadn\u0027t - and we were just relying on Tilley lamps.\u0027Everybody expects washing machines now here and everybody has one apart from me. I\u0027m the last person washing by hand here.\u0027          Aggie came to the Scoraig in 1975 and is the last person to be washing their clothes on the peninsulaDale, 47 \u0027I was fed up with working in an office all day looking at a screen and having to pay to go to a gym to keep fit.\u0027I was fed up with all the people - it would take me 40 minutes to drive seven miles to get into work.\u0027We could have moved not so far away but I had been to Scotland a few times and fancied it.\u0027There is a proper sense of community here, which I think is lacking in other parts of the country.\u0027Everybody knows everybody and everybody helps each other out.\u0027It\u0027s the environmental thing, where you can live from solar and wind power and you don\u0027t need coal and nuclear power.\u0027And because you know what you are consuming, where your water comes from and your power, you are always going to be environmentally friendly.\u0027I used to preach about environmental stuff and then go home and put my 48in flat-screen TV on - but here, you can really live it.\u0027          Dale was fed up working in an office so decided to up sticks and enjoy a remote lifestyle on Scoraig Jeannie,  60    \u0027I moved from California and go back when I can to visit. I came here and I saw this place and I was walking down to Ruigh\u0027riabhach from Scoraig pier, and one of the Icelandic ponies that lived here walked me down the track and I saw the Beinn, and I knew it was home, it was a totally strong feeling. I had already spent several years travelling around Scotland and the islands and had run a bed and breakfast for a couple years on the Black Isle.\u0027\u0027I was the first in the new wave here in 1995. Since then many more people have come to live here, more adults and some children, some older adults and younger children. \u0027I had been living on the Black Isle for a few years and I was visiting Scotland, it¿s kind of a long story. I came here to work at a retreat centre where Luke and Pixie live now and Tom had built it with his former wife, it\u0027s so stunning. It\u0027s this incredible giant hand made house. \u0027Tom was there on his own, still married to Sundara who lived in Glasgow and I met Tom. Maybe a couple of months later we started travelling in the Highlands and working. We built a reed bed sewage system for a hostel in Glen Affric. It was a good summer, hot like this one. We travelled for 7 months and we came back and moved into Tom\u0027s bothy. \u0027There was nothing, just rock, heather and everything happened from there. Tom and I fell in love and we had our daughter Ise, it\u0027s Gaelic, it means \u0027herself\u0027. She lives in Ullapool. I have never wanted stuff, it doesn\u0027t suit me I guess. I never felt that sense of entitlement which isn\u0027t exclusively American but which many Americans, and others, seem to feel. I hate that word \u0027ex-pat\u0027 it\u0027s just not it.\u0027           Jeannie is a California native. She moved to Scoraig after several years living in Scotland. She was first of the 1995 \u0027new wave\u0027Tommy,  50 \u0027I was born in Sydney, in Australia. I lived there about a year and then I travelled with my parents at the age of about 1 throughout Asia including the Soviet Union. They had a multi stop ticket home and stopped at the maximum number of locations that was permitted by the ticket. \u0027My parents hadn\u0027t moved here yet, we lived in a small village in Northamptonshire. I was 6 when we moved here. I did like it here, I liked the freedom to roam about and I was obsessed with fishing so from a very early age I was taking myself down to the shore with a hook and line and catching fish and running around with the other children as normal. Perhaps I was nostalgic for my previous home. I think everyone always is a little nostalgic, I think, especially for children, there is always nostalgia, it\u0027s universal.\u0027I am currently working at the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, at the Institute of Philosophy and Law. At our department (Foreign Languages), PhD students are helped to communicate in academic English. My primary role there is to support my scientific colleagues in both written and spoken academic English. \u0027I\u0027ve been to quite a few other small places, especially working with broadband on the islands, and people have quite often compared Scoraig with to the island of Eigg.\u0027I am pretty sure they don\u0027t lock their doors on Eigg either, but obviously if people go away for long periods of time they do lock their doors. Generally, there are very low levels of crime here and people trust each other and look out for each other. Perhaps the main difference is the geographical isolation – if you were to have a thief here, where would he keep the stolen goods? It\u0027s darned difficult to thieve from here especially if you don\u0027t want to get caught!\u0027          Tommy was born in Sydney, Australia.  He works at the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences  supporting scientific colleagues in both written and spoken academic English           Estha, 42\u0027I was born in Inverness, my Mum Russ hitched in to have me so I hear. Nigel is my step Dad. We have lived in a few places, I lived over the side at Achmore which is even more remote than Scoraig and also down by the pier by Jonah and Rhona\u0027s at the shop where the post box is.\u0027I was in Ullapool for a year just working, it was great because I was 16, just that there were boys around, that sort of stuff. I don\u0027t know about living in another place to bring up kids as I\u0027ve always been here. \u0027Growing up here was brilliant, we were always outside and could do pretty much anything as long as we came home for dinner. We\u0027d go in boats, do lobster pots, at about 11 years of age. \u0027Even at school lunch break we\u0027d go down to the sea to go swimming, to pick muscles and have a fire and cook them on the shore. Not everyone but some people would pick winkles to get money, on their own. \u0027I think because there was such a large group of us that our parents never worried because there was always somebody older looking after us. Parents were always aware of where we were on Scoraig and half keeping an eye out for us. \u0027We\u0027d go camping on the hill and my friend built himself a little house that he lived in when he was 13. He was very independent and his dad was an artist, just that he would take over the whole house. Personally I would choose to bring children up here which is why I am here but the only thing I feel that I missed out on was dancing, a dance school. \u0027A family came here recently with a small child and they came round and asked how we managed as there is so much danger, the sea down there and the cows and the list went on. And I said how do you manage in a town with all the cars and all the people everywhere.\u0027          Estha enjoyed his childhood on the island. He said: \u0027Growing up here was brilliant, we were always outside and could do pretty much anything as long as we came home for dinner\u0027          Scoraig is only accessible by boat or a five mile walk and its homes and school are powered by wind.  Scoraig\u0027s jetty is pictured Anthea, 73\u0027The air here is so good, that\u0027s my secret to good age, and lots of exercising, laughing, enjoying life and good friends. I come from Lancashire, near Preston. \u0027I didn\u0027t choose to come up here, I was in a very stressful job, I worked for a mental health day centre and my husband said that I needed to get a way because of stress so we sold the house and bought a converted ambulance which had a caravan attached to it. \u0027It was a friend\u0027s and they didn\u0027t want it anymore. We just set off on the road, we didn\u0027t know where we going. Jeff my husband didn\u0027t have a car licence so had a Robin Reliant and he was the scout, he searched for places to go. We spent a couple of weeks getting here, and we ended up on the Faine, it\u0027s the long stretch from Braymore junction to Dundonnell. We parked there for about a week and then the police said you\u0027re on the land that belongs to the laird and you\u0027d better move on. \u0027So we both decided we\u0027d better have a look to see if there was anywhere else we could park.We had an accident with the Robin Reliant, we skidded in a flash flood, rolled over and went along on the roof.\u0027We went to the hotel and the lassie behind the bar said why don\u0027t you go and park at the car park at Badlaurach jetty which is the one opposite here. We stayed in the car park and got to know a few of the people that live here. We sold the ambulance and caravan because we were offered a place on the apportionment of the croft, a bit of land that isn¿t any good. We bought another caravan and brought it over on a scallop raft and towed it to here. \u0027We lived in it and built a shack on the side with a funny little stove in it and we managed. We had no electricity and we had storm lanterns and candle light. Then we got a little windmill and had a bit of electricity going in. Things happen in life for a reason as far as I\u0027m concerned and I was meant to come here. We had never heard of Scoraig and had gone around the top of Scotland a couple of times but ended up just heading this way.\u0027           Anthea and her husband set off to Scoraig in a converted ambulance which had a caravan attached to it. She didn\u0027t have a plan for where she was going when she set off Sandy, 64\u0027I\u0027ve been here 3 years. I fell in love with it in the 80s with the free festivals then I fell in love with it again when the Mother of my youngest moved here and I would visit. I heard about the free festivals through a hippy friend.\u0027A tiny bit was the attraction of coming here by boat. It has an attractiveness of its own, it segregates the community from the world at large which allows it a freedom, a privilege which is right up my street. It\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve felt at home my entire life - I don\u0027t have any neighbours who would rather I wasn\u0027t here.\u0027I tend to be a bit of an outsider and my response is to hide under a stone and I have always felt that society was going to give me a hard time. I\u0027ve always got on with lots of people but there were always some people who didn\u0027t want me around, that\u0027s what I felt like. \u0027The big signifier here now is that I belong to a committee, I would have laughed at anybody ten years ago that said this would be a possibility but I feel a part of the community. \u0027That\u0027s what I came here for and that\u0027s what I\u0027ve got. It\u0027s because of its history and because of its remoteness. It\u0027s because it went from old crofters to new incoming hippies.\u0027          Sandy, here at home, said he has always regarded himself as an outsider but enjoys being part of the community on Scoraig Claire, 27, and Damien, 27 \u0027I am French and was born in Poitiers. I arrived first in Scotland in March and Damien arrived in May. We began our relationship in France one week before I left to come here to Scotland.\u0027I had already planned my travel with the WWOOFiNG before we met. I had already been here 6 years ago with my brother for just 2 weeks and I had already travelled a bit and my favourite country was Scotland. \u0027I wanted to go to a white country and an English speaking country. I was looking ta WWOOFING online and wanted to do gardening and I am vegetarian so didn\u0027t want to work with livestock so I saw this place and it looked really beautiful. \u0027My main destination was Shetland, that was the centre of my travel but I planned all of my WWOOFING before leaving France and wanted to come here after seeing the photos. I saw that you have to take a boat here, that was interesting for me, I really wanted to be isolated, I needed it. I lived in Paris for a few months at a friend\u0027s house and I had too many simulations in big cities and I wanted to find myself and be in an isolated place. \u0027I mostly chose isolated places like Shetland, Lewis and here. I\u0027ve been around too many people, too much information, it\u0027s too stressful and exhausting. I come from the countryside, I need to have peace, I really need it. \u0027I  cannot stand to be in cities anymore. I need simple ways to live and I found it in Scoraig.\u0027            Claire and Damien are newcomers to the island. Claire arrived first in Scotland in March and Damien arrived in MayNigel, 62, and Ross, 68  \u0027It was 1970, I was at teaching training college and in my 3rd year I thought I\u0027d had enough, and my room mate at college and I hitched up here from Bradford, with Kath who also lives here now, without knowing where we would be going, it was either Scotland or Ireland.\u0027We were looking for a place to stay, it was November time and we asked a tourist agency for a place to stay and Alan Bush was a name that was offered. They answered the one phone on the peninsula and they said come and have a look and so we jumped on a boat. \u0027Both Kath and I weren\u0027t attending that well, so we both left in our 3rd year. We didn\u0027t like the crowds and wanted to go north. It was very different then, there were no wind powers, there were Tilly lamps and bucketing water. I think the peace made me stay, I think I used to want to travel around a lot to other countries but I remember walking up to the top of the local hill and I looked out and thought I wouldn\u0027t be able to find anywhere else with the same beauty and tranquillity and then the years just fly by.  \u0027It was 1979 I met Nigel. When I first came here you could see right across the peninsula but now with the growth of trees it is not as open as it was, and the wood is useful for fuel. The forestry commission wanted trees planted and we needed shelter really so a lot of trees were planted.  \u0027I always admired what they achieved, they did the original tracks here and houses and cleared the stones from the fields with horses, lots of children and lots of hardship. People might think it is hard living here but it\u0027s nothing like the hardship they had, if you keep that in your mind it keeps things in perspective. To do with world affairs it\u0027s hardly hardship. We\u0027re alot better than Syria, Afghanistan and most of Africa.

The current allegations could see Ghosn facing 10 years behind bars andor a 10-million-yen fine.Separately, Kyodo has reported that Nissan paid $100,000 annually since 2002 to Ghosn\u0027s sister for a non-existent \u0027advisory\u0027 role.And the Mainichi Shimbun reported on Monday that Ghosn used Nissan\u0027s corporate money to pay a donation to his daughter\u0027s university and also charged family trips to the company.Both Ghosn and Kelly have reportedly denied the allegations.   Mitsubishi Motors Corp.

It employs around 450,000 people worldwide.But the future of the tie-up is now uncertain as the talismanic Ghosn was seen as the glue binding together a fractious Franco-Japanese alliance with headquarters 10,000 kilometres (6,000 miles) apart.\u0027We (have) had two years of the alliance and there were positive parts... and parts that needed to be revised a little from Mitsubishi Motors\u0027 point of view,\u0027 said Masuko. Nissan board vote unanimously to fire disgraced chairman...Nissan chairman is arrested after \u0027£34m pay swindle that saw...Car makers fear they won\u0027t \u0027survive\u0027 in Britain due Theresa...Share this articleA seven-person Nissan board, the parent company of Mitsubishi, decided unanimously on Thursday to jettison the once-revered leader Nissan\u0027s current CEO Hiroto Saikawa told staff on Monday he was \u0027shocked\u0027 at his former mentor\u0027s alleged misconduct.At a 45-minute meeting attended by hundreds of staff at the firm\u0027s Yokohama HQ and broadcast internally to other sites, Saikawa stressed that the scandal should not affect day-to-day operations.Saikawa, who rose through the Nissan ranks under Ghosn\u0027s wing, has already spoken of his \u0027great resentment and dismay\u0027 at the allegations.According to Japanese media, Nissan formed a \u0027secret\u0027 cell within the firm to look into the alleged financial misdeeds.Executives accelerated the probe amid concerns Ghosn was working on a fully fledged merger between Nissan and Renault, Kyodo News said without naming its sources.

Not to do so would be irresponsible. It needs to be someone palatable to the Japanese and the French.\u0027Investors appeared to be recovering from the initial shock of the arrest, which sent shares in all three firms tumbling.At the Tokyo close, Nissan was up nearly two percent and Mitsubishi Motors enjoyed an even sharper bump - up more than three percent just ahead of the board meeting. "},{"url":null,"title":"Mystery Swansea University suspends vice chancellor three members staff","story":"    Professor Richard Davies has been the vice chancellor of the university since 2003Staff have today been sent a message titled \u0027internal investigation\u0027 by registrar Andrew Rhodes.Oh, what a lovely war!

Inspectors said the school is \u0027failing its pupils\u0027 and \u0027significant and wide-ranging weaknesses have developed over time\u0027 that require urgent improvement.An earlier report in 2013 rated it good. In his resignation letter two months ago, Mr Povey said he took full responsibility for the errors - which involved how attendance, exclusions and home schooling were being recorded - but claimed he had been unfairly treated.He wrote on Twitter: \u0027I am at a loss to understand the heavy handed approach adopted by the council, which appears to have completely ignored the best interests of the students, staff and school.\u0027Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, he claimed he had been a \u0027thorn\u0027 in the side of Salford Council over the rising levels of debt he says the school racked up under its direction.\u0027It\u0027s fair to say that I\u0027ve been a thorn in the side of Salford council since I became headteacher,\u0027 he said. \u0027I have not kept my mouth shut about the debt, or the impact of the debt on the kids, staff and community.\u0027People also believe that in some way this may be connected to the fact that we didn\u0027t go into the Salford Academy Trust - but who knows.

Everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a chance to redeem themselves.’”He is staying with his father, John Adoboli, a retired diplomat, in a suburban neighbourhood in Tema, a thriving port city about 15 miles from the capital that is twinned with the London borough of Greenwich. In contrast to the often chilly and grey UK weather, temperatures rarely dip below 30C (86F) and most months Ghanaians enjoy more than 200 hours of sunshine.While Adoboli is at pains to emphasise his love for the country of his birth, for his family there and for the wider Ghanaian community, the UK has been his home for the past 26 years and he identifies with British culture and values.He has built up a wide support network in Britain, with a core of 25 close friends including his girlfriend, Alice Gray, his friends Pippa Scott and Roland Verhaaf and their two sons aged three and five. Adoboli lived with Scott and Verhaaf in Scotland for more than three years after being released from prison.“This is not about not liking Ghana,” he says of his seven-year battle against deportation. “It is about what has been taken away from me in the UK.”As well as his loyal friends, from school, university and other areas of his life, he is mourning no longer being able to enjoy the seasons. “I’m missing seeing the end of autumn and I won’t see the promise of spring,” he says.He left the UK with just a small rucksack he had packed when he went to report at a Home Office centre in Glasgow where he was arrested prior to deportation.“I don’t have much use for my waxed Barbour coat here,” he says. “It’s hanging in the wardrobe. I need to get some more T-shirts though.”Adoboli is not the only one who is distraught. Scott, Verhaaf and their children are feeling his absence keenly. Most of his belongings accumulated over 26 years of living in the UK remain in his bedroom in their home. The children do not understand why he is no longer there.“We told them Kweku is staying with his parents. The three-year-old said: ‘Oh OK let’s go and see him there then,’ and went to put on his shoes and coat,” says Scott.“Kweku doesn’t fit the materialistic banker stereotype,” she adds. “He has left behind lots of books, novels and classics, some clothes and his running shoes. Oh, and his toothbrush. On a whiteboard in the bedroom his notes about work he was doing on his Home Office and legal case are still there.”Their older child has started learning to read and every night reads the list of words given by school to practise down the phone to Adoboli.One item left in his old bedroom is a medal from the Queen he received after a three-day training session with UK and US special forces on counter-terrorism. He was one of several guest speakers along with Tony Blair and he travelled in a helicopter with the former prime minister.The event was organised through the Forward Institute, which promotes responsible leadership in business and society, which Adoboli has been working with. On the three-day development course he was asked to speak about learning from failure and risk-taking in highly complex situations. The medal and a bottle of whisky were his reward.Four days later, at the beginning of September, he was arrested and detained. The irony of one arm of the Home Office treating him royally while another detained and deported him is not lost on Adoboli and his friends.While he is still in a state of shock and grief about his removal from the UK and the forced separation from his loved ones, he is relieved to no longer be living under the yoke of the Home Office. “It’s the first time I have felt free in seven years,” he says. “The Home Office destroys lives. Destroys lives.”The Home Office said it did not comment on inidual cases."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/160559cb39beb23732274549368c26c3776687b0/0_87_2164_1298/master/2164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a0a210df6bf6baae17d3be7894828f6","title":"george soross open society foundation to pull out of turkey","story":"Decision comes after Turkish president accuses billionaire philanthropist of trying to destroy nations George Soros’s Open Society Foundations group has said it will cease operations in Turkey, days after the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, accused the billionaire philanthropist of trying to ide and destroy nations.The organisation said it had been the target of baseless claims in the Turkish media that made it impossible for it to continue its work.It also faced an investigation by the interior ministry that sought to demonstrate a link, which it denied, between the foundation and protests at Gezi Park in Istanbul in 2013.One of its founders in Turkey, Hakan Altinay, was among 13 people detained 10 days ago.

The comedy actor Will Hay, who was a successful amateur astronomer when not entertaining the public with classics such as Oh! Mr Porter, is on the list, along with Roger Bannister, who died in March, the first runner to achieve the four-minute mile, who later pursued a career in medicine.The Bank said first-stage nominees on the list had simply been deemed eligible because they were real, deceased and had contributed to UK science in some way. It said the names had yet to be considered by its banknote character advisory committee.Questions have, however, been raised over the former prime minister’s connection to the invention. Steve Tillyer, a writer on British ice-cream history, told the New Yorker magazine after Thatcher died that soft-scoop ice cream had originated in the US about a decade before Thatcher joined J Lyons. However, the firm was at the forefront of the industry during her time it had teamed up with US ice-cream company Mister Softee and ran franchises under that name."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/653c17472147c26d6d5155c90cb4afb77c3cc0a5/540_361_5005_3003/master/5005.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad516246682174a84419ae2f3bbff56a","title":"cyber monday live best uk deals christmas","story":"Didn’t get everything you needed for Christmas on Black Friday?

Shopping online isn’t without potential pitfalls, and Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of online comparison service money, has this advice for people doing their Christmas shopping today.She says shoppers should “factor in the cost of delivery when you compare prices online. Check whether you can click and collect for free, as this can be a good way to save if you live near a store.”She also warns us to be on our guard, saying “just because a retailer tells you they’ve cut the price of an item you can’t take it as gospel you’ll only know it’s good value by shopping around. Be suspicious and check.”And there is a reminder of the consumer rights you enjoy when ordering online: “You get 14 days from the day your order arrives to return it and get a refund. This gives you the flexibility to cancel if you find your bargain cheaper elsewhere. There are some exceptions, like personalised goods, but it’s guaranteed on most other purchases.”If possible, she says, “pay for items that cost over £100 by credit card to get protection, so you can go to your credit card company for a refund if there’s an issue.”Her final warning is one that applies to virtually everything on the internet, whether it is fake news or a Cyber Monday bargain: “If a deal seems too good to be true, treat it with a healthy degree of uncertainty.”One of the things about Christmas is that it inevitably leads into the new year, and grand plans to re-invent yourself into a healthier lifestyle. What if you could prepare for that moment in advance? Here’s how you can do that, and save a little bit of money as well, with Cyber Monday deals on subscription boxes.

Her role will include lecturing and research, and she will also develop the health and wellbeing provision across the college, ensuring it is tailored to musicians’ needs.Kathy Hart, the RNCM students’ union president, said many students had gone through more than a decade of dedication, sacrifice and hard work to win their place at the college.“When I talk to friends, I see that the work needed to build such a difficult career can come at a price, both physically and psychologically,” she said.“Like athletes, we must keep in peak condition to make the most of the opportunities we have fought so hard for. The more work we put in, the higher the stakes become – and the more devastating the impact if we are held back by injury or mental health struggles.”The Manchester college plans to lay on extra counselling sessions for students, particularly when performance pressures are at their peak, plus wellbeing activities such as yoga to help prevent injury. The RNCM also intends to extend its community outreach so more students get to work with people in need.Ascenso said: “We want our students to learn how to make music with excellence, but also how to live fulfilling lives as musicians and as human beings more generally.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f66e364c31138e09dd497e2657075b1d3b021201/188_571_4808_2885/master/4808.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=360cc0d210a6e2fb5f9d53b7b532c636","title":"durian malaysia chinese demand stinky fruit","story":"Prices of ‘Musang King’ variety of stinky delicacy have nearly quadrupled in five yearsThe stinky, spiky durian will become Malaysia’s next big export as the south-east Asian nation rushes to develop thousands of hectares to cash in on unprecedented demand from China for the fruit.“The durian industry is transforming from local to global, large-scale farming due to the great demand from China,” said Lim Chin Khee, a durian industry consultant. “Before the boom, a durian farm in Malaysia would be a leisure farm … Now they are hundreds of acres and bigger, and many more will come.”Durian may be banned in some airports, public transport and hotels in south-east Asia for its pungent smell, but Chinese people are huge fans. Durian-flavoured foods sold in China include pizza, butter, salad dressing and milk.Chinese markets pay top price for Malaysia’s “Musang King” durian because of its creamy texture and bittersweet taste.

Legs do take longer to cook than breasts, but it is easier – the oven does all the work. Succulent, soft pieces of meat for a fraction of the price.A tip: If you can’t find quince, use pear instead, but omit the poaching step.2-3 duck legsSalt and black pepper½ tsp ground cinnamon1 tsp ground coriander1 tsp ground cumin2 tbsp pomegranate molasses plus 1 tbsp for the radicchio3 tbsp honeyZest and juice of 1 small orangeFor the quince1 large2 small quinceZest and juice of 1 lemon5 tbsp golden caster sugar1 tsp rosewater1 sprig thymeFor the salad1 head radicchio, cut into eighths through the stem6 tbsp olive oil1 handful dill, finely chopped3 spring onions, finely chopped200g large grained couscous, like the Palestinian maftoul A big handful of walnuts, finely chopped, to serveSeeds of ½ pomegranate, to serveHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4. Pat the duck dry with kitchen paper, and pierce the skin a few times with a sharp knife. Season well, mix the spices and rub half the mixture over the legs. Put on a baking tray and roast in the oven for an hour and 45 minutes, until the skin is crisp and the meat tender.Meanwhile, whisk together the molasses, honey and orange, and brush half of this over the legs several times during the final 30 minutes of roasting, reserving the rest for the dressing.Now peel, quarter and core the quince. Peel the lemon zest with a potato peeler, avoiding the white pith, and put in a small pan with half the lemon juice, quince, four tablespoons of the sugar, rosewater and thyme. Cover with water, bring to a simmer and cook for 25-30 minutes, until the quince is tender but still holding its shape. Drain, reserving the cooking liquor, and cut each quarter across into thick slices. Arrange on a baking sheet, sprinkle with the remaining sugar and put in the oven underneath the duck for the last half-hour.When cooked, leave the duck to rest, covered, in a warm place. Cover the couscous with boiling water, season and leave for five minutes.Heat a griddle pan on a high heat. Toss the radicchio in a tablespoon each of olive oil and pomegranate molasses, season, then grill for 90 seconds a side, until it begins to wilt. Whisk the remaining olive oil with the orange-honey marinade, dill, spring onions, remaining lemon juice and a tablespoon of the quince liquor (use the rest for cocktails), and season. Arrange the couscous, quince and radicchio on a large serving plate and dress. Top with chunks of roast duck (you will easily be able to cut away tender chunks), walnuts and pomegranate seeds, and serve at once. A crisp chicory salad would be a great accompaniment.Other grains, such as pearl barley and quinoa, also work well in this autumnal salad – lentils do, too.

And if we go to the quarter-finals and maybe you are lucky to go forward. After that, the competition it speaks for itself. A lot of desires, a lot of wishes we can have at the end. The competition is so tough, so clinical, to say if you are better you are going to win, if you don’t, you are going home.”Guardiola was referring to the muscle injuries to Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gündogan, which means they join Kevin De Bruyne as frontline midfielders who are unavailable. While Gabriel Jesus also has a foot problem, the absence of Silva and Gündogan means Guardiola will have to decide whether to give Phil Foden a second Champions League start of his fledgling career.Guardiola has no doubt the 18-year-old is ready for the challenge. “I had the feeling in pre-season – I was incredibly impressed then,” he said. “He’s stronger, more conscious that he’s able to play with us.“Every time he has played he’s played good, pre-season, 90 minutes, always good. When you ask I always say he’s part of the squad and he’s definitely ready.”Lyon inflicted City’s sole defeat in all competitions this season, winning September’s reverse fixture 2-1. “They were better than us,” Guardiola said. “We lost the first game against a tough team and we have the chance to qualify. We come to do our jobs.A draw will ensure progression and it would also take Lyon through if Hoffenheim against Shakhtar Donestk also finishes level. “I want to qualify, that’s the first target,” Guardiola said. “If you make one or two mistakes you can be out. This competition is so dangerous. We have not qualified and in this competition it’s not done until it’s done.“The first thing is to qualify and then to finish first in the group and we travel here to do that. You lose the first game at home and the group stage becomes so tough. We did our job winning the next three.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c54f4fd4312deb832d7a73419dae425b35a5424/146_20_2153_1292/master/2153.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8525fde45cb1d3d26551eb79a19f96c","title":"burnley v newcastle premier league live","story":"46 min Peep peep! Newcastle begin the second half.That was lots of fun. Newcastle were in total control at 2-0, with both goals coming from corners, before Sam Vokes’ 18-yard header sparked a frantic end to the first half. See you in 10 minutes for the second half.45+1 min Vokes’ shot takes a defletion and spins wide of the far post. Burnley, who played some nice football early on without creating anything, are now pummelling Newcastle with crosses and causing plenty of problems. There’s a moral in that story.45 min: Good save from Dubravka! A long cross from the right was headed down by Vokes to Wood, who slammed a rising half-volley towards goal from the edge of the area. It was close enough for Dubravka to react smartly and tip it over the bar.42 min Schar splashes a shot over the bar from 35 yards.42 min Goals change moods, and the Burnley crowd have returned to supporting rather than groaning at their team. This has been a very entertaining game.41 min “Hey Rob,” says J. R. in Illinois. “I just ate all the gravy left over from Thanksgiving for lunch and now I’m feeling pretty logy. I can’t guarantee I’m going to make it through this game without nodding off for a bit. Anyhow, as for current footballers to have a chat with I’d go for Jonathan Walters. He seems like a lively fella and also pretty straightforward. I’d ask him about behind the scenes Roy Keane stories, details on the many hilarious hijinks at Stoke (remember the pig head in the locker jape?), and would also ask what exactly Martin O’Neill does.”Mee drove a long angled pass towards the edge of the area, where Vokes got a run on Clark and looped a superb header over Dubravka. You could argue Dubravka’s positioning was imperfect - he was maybe four yards off his line - but it was a towering header.Sam Vokes brings Burnley back into the game with an excellent header!39 min Newcastle are in control of the game now, and the home crowd are increasingly restless. 37 min The corner is worked short to Kenedy, who slices high and wide from 20 yards.36 min Schar drills a brilliant crossfield pass to Ritchie, who wins a corner off Lennon...31 min Burnley started the game full of pep but they have looked forlorn since the second goal went in.27 min Newcastle took three points from their first 10 games. A win here would make it nine from the last three.25 min The scoreline is harsh on Burnley, who have played most of the football in the first 25 minutes. Newcastle will not care one jot, and nor should they.This was a more orthodox set-piece goal. Ritchie worked a short corner and hit an inswinging cross towards Clark, who steered an accomplished header across Hart and into the far corner.Newcastle have scored again from a right-wing corner!22 min Newcastle break down the other end, where Rondon’s shot is kicked behind for a corner.21 min Wood hits a vicious, dipping shot from 25 yards which goes through Dubravka’s hands and hits him straight in the face. The late movement of the ball caught him by surprise.20 min Perez slips past Lowton on the right of the box, but Long comes across to make an important tackle.18 min Burnley are playing some nice, snappy football, though they haven’t really created anything of note.16 min Diame is penalised but not booked for a late tackle on Lowton.14 min Newcastle keep the ball for 30 seconds or so before Kenedy’s long-range shot is blocked.12 min It’s like a training exercise at the moment, Burnley attack versus Newcastle defence. Both are doing their jobs pretty well. Cork floats a lovely pass out to Lowton, whose very deep cross is sliced wide on the run by Wood. It was a tricky chance.10 min Burnley are playing at a good tempo, with Lennon especially lively on the right. 8 min Burnley have had all of the ball since the goal. Newcastle are usually happy to sit in at 0-0 away from home, so they’ll be thrilled to do so with a 1-0 lead. Perez and Kenedy should be a threat on the break.6 min Scratch that: it was going wide, so it’s a Mee own goal.5 min I think Fernandez’s shot was on target, in which case it’ll go down as his goal, though it would have been an easy save for Hart without the deflection.The goal came from a right-wing corner that only half cleared by Burnley. Eventually the ball came to Fernandez, whose speculative shot from 20 yards took a deflection off Ben Mee and looped over Joe Hart.Newcastle take an early lead!3 min Diame’s long-range shot deflects off Long for a corner.2 min Newcastle are actually playing with Ciaran Clark in a back three. Matt Ritchie and DeAndre Yedlin are playing as wing backs.1 min Peep peep! Burnley get the match under way. They are in claret and blue Newcastle are in black and white stripes.The players emerge from the tunnel to the rousing sound of Wake Up by Arcade Fire. The Burnley DJ has just gone up in my estimation. If they play Flatlining by the Amazing Snakeheads every time a goal is scored I’ll be even more impressed.“Training was very good during the international break and the feeling in the squad is very good. We’ve had a tough start to the season for many different reasons but in the last few games we’ve had that edge that you need.”“Sometimes the international break is bad, when you have momentum. We have to deal with that. Burnley play in a certain way - they physically very strong and are good at home. It’s so tight at the bottom and hopefully we’ll get three points.”Nice footballers in shops getting coffee“If we extend the definition of current, I’d go with Romelu Lukaku,” says Rob Edwards. “His interview answers are genuinely thoughtful and devoid of cliches.”Yes, he talks an immaculate game, to be fair to him. A bit more news from the Press Association on the medical emergency at Turf Moor“Kick-off at Turf Moor was pushed back by half an hour until 8.30pm after referees’ assessor Eddie Wolstenholme collapsed in the tunnel. “Wolstenholme was taken to hospital conscious but referee Anthony Taylor and the Premier League decided to delay the start of the match.“Wolstenholme was formerly a Premier League referee who retired from officiating in 2003.”“Hi Rob,” says Shaun Wilkinson. “With all the negativity and aggression swirling around the world at the moment (Brexit, Trump, Salvini, Boca vs River and so on) I want to lighten the mood and think of nice things. Which current footballer, in your opinion, would be the nicest one to go and have a coffee and a chat with? I am going for Heung-Min Son.”The kick-off has been delayed by half an hour due to a medical emergency in the players’ tunnel. Sky Sports’ Greg Whelan reports that the person, who wasn’t a player on either side, is conscious and has been taken to hospital.Hello. It’s getting pretty snug down the bottom of the Premier League. Only one point separates the bottom six, a group which includes the two teams playing tonight. Burnley and Newcastle have each done a stretch at the bottom of the table now they are 17th and 15th respectively, separated only by goal difference.This is a meeting of pragmatists. Sean Dyche and Rafa Benitez aren’t synonymous with sexxy football, and there are plenty predicting a 0-0 draw tonight, but there’s much to admire about two of the Premier League’s bigger overachievers. Newcastle’s form has picked up in recent weeks, with wins in their last two games. Burnley have taken a few poundings of late, but it would still be a surprise if either of these sides was in a relegation battle come the spring.Kick off is at 8pm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherOur notion of the traditional household is changing.

What impact is this having on our lives, and what can be done to prevent it? We want to hear your thoughtsIs the internet really destroying our high streets?Increasingly, the convenience and cheapness of online retailers like Amazon is cannibalising independent firms and high street retailers. Many buyers skip the trip into town, or go there to assess the product and then buy it cheaper from the comfort of their sofa. As global capitalism continues its seemingly unstoppable growth, many wonder if we have reached “peak stuff”, thanks to years of high consumption. The switch to online shopping, combined with a slowdown in spending and rising costs from business rates and wages, has battered the profit margins of many retailers. There is also a major shift underway in how consumers spend their leisure time, too – more often choosing to spend their spare cash on holidays and experiences rather than in shopping malls, and increasingly opting to entertain, dine and drink at home. Meanwhile, businesses such as beauty salons, barbers and health clubs are on the ascent, since their services cannot be replicated online, and for many countries there has been a massive surge in vaping shops, coffee houses, and ice cream parlours.The growth in e-commerce is often cited as the main reason well-known retailers are struggling. But is taxing online firms the whole solution? After it was raised in the UK’s budget, the British high street momentarily looked set for rehabilitation. But 2018 has seen more closures across the country. Pubs, fashion outlets and estate agents are prominent among 24,205 closures recorded in the first six months of this year in the UK alone, and the number of shops, pubs and restaurants lying empty has soared by more than 4,400. And that’s just in Britain.Every year, the crisis faced by huge numbers of shops and businesses costs tens of thousands of jobs across Europe and the US. Major chains have collapsed into administration this year while many others have been forced to seek legal agreements with their landlords to shut stores and slash their rent bills. Beyond retail, many towns are having to fight to save their local library, pub, nursery or community centre – the places that have always fulfilled a social function as well as a commercial one.Yet, amid all this, it is easy to forget that, globally, the vast majority of sales – at least four-fifths – are still made in stores, as e-commerce giants have noted. The two worlds are still in the process of converging, so what might this mean for our communities, and is there hope yet of a resurgence?We want to examine the effects of these retail shift on the lives of people across the world, and how it is impacting economies, democracies, and families. How are local businesses coping or adapting? And workers with specialist skills? How is the ‘warehouse culture’ affecting rates of job satisfaction and the welfare of iniduals? And importantly, what action can we take to help slow or even reverse the onward march of e-commerce giants, or at least make them only a part of the picture. We at the  have covered how York’s Bishy road has cultivated the creation of what urban planners call ‘a sticky street’, where ‘time spent’ and enjoyment factor are the key aims of retailers, and we’ve explored how the ‘experience economy’ of a high street without actual shops could work. Our reporters have gone to areas like Bristol and Liverpool where local currencies have been trialled as a means of keeping profits in the neighbourhood. And we continue to examine whether taxing online retailers is the most effective thing that can be done to ease the situation.The debate is ongoing, and we want to hear from you, wherever you are in the world, for this month’s podcast.

I was gutted to stop working alongside my amazing job-share, Heather Stewart, but excited to find myself back at our headquarters in King’s Cross.The new team was placed on a bank of desks on the second floor, close to the Observer newsroom, where colleagues I’d worked with for eight years before leaving for the parliamentary lobby in 2009 are still beavering away. On our other side are (usefully!) the lawyers and the sports desk, followed by global development writers, and a strengthened environment team.Then – just two minutes around the corner – is the newsdesk, where the volume rises as editors gather around desks to make quick, collective decisions on rolling stories.Given our aim is to showcase  and Observer journalism by telling its stories in a fresh and engaging way, sitting in the middle of two newsrooms feels like the perfect location. Meanwhile, we can turn to the reporting teams in the US and Australia, foreign correspondents in Europe, Africa and Asia and some of the best opinion writers in the world.As for the podcast itself, our central aim is to provide listeners with 20 minutes every day that never scrimps on storytelling but is anchored in the news agenda.To achieve that, the  has built a team that feels unique: because it brings together radio documentary makers with news junkies like me. That mix of skills and ideas has lent itself to an incredibly creative team in which everyone is learning a huge amount.And I’ve been really pleased with the pieces that combination of strengths has resulted in already – focusing on interesting news ideas, but telling them in a narrative, audio-rich way that we hope to develop over time. The first few episodes have been well received and have already given us good ideas on what works well.The most exciting thing has been quickly realising the scale of the talent we have to draw on here at the . Having covered politics for many years, I already knew there were excellent reporters in domestic policy areas such as the ’s Patrick Butler, an expert on universal credit, and – of course – Heather and her team in Westminster, with whom we have covered the fast-moving story of Brexit. However, I had not worked with foreign correspondents such as Tom Phillips and Bethan McKernan, whose takes on the election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and the war in Yemen combined excellent analysis with powerful and emotional stories from the ground.The format has also allowed us to be experimental, whether that means interviews with external figures such as the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, or spending a day racing around Westminster to give a behind-the-scenes feel on a huge day for news.My co-presenter, India Rakusen, has done powerful episodes: one on poverty in Britain and another on the legacy of the Iraq war, for which Peter Beaumont was able to record for the podcast on the ground.The fact that not many others are producing similar content in the UK means that Today in Focus is inevitably a work in progress in every respect, from the subjects we choose and people we interview to the workflow we follow to get the product completed each day.The overall hope is to bring  stories, told by its reporters alongside their writing, to a wider, younger and more erse audience. And our position, at the centre of a values-based organisation whose global voice has been amplified in the face of political shocks such as the elections of Donald Trump and Brexit, make that something I believe we can achieve.Being based in the  means we can be more credible than many of the websites cheerleading for their favoured politicians, but far more spiky than the BBC. Where the Today programme tries to give you headlines, we want to give you heart.We hope to offer a mix of immediate news stories, looked at from fresh angles, alongside deep es into major, rolling stories. Then there is an opinion section, where we will hear from  and Observer regulars as well as other voices from outside the building.For me, it’s a bit of a dream job, isn’t it? I get to sit in a studio day after day, discussing really interesting topics with the best journalists in the world, and working alongside some of the best young producers in the country to find new ways to present them. So far, in pilots and for real episodes, I’ve been discussing everything you can imagine, from Trump to Theresa May, the refugee crisis to Brexit, plastics to cocaine.And I’ve already experienced how differently you get to engage with your audience through a podcast. Along with Heather, I’ve been presenting Politics Weekly for the past two years, and I’ve always loved hearing from listeners who say they feel closer to my reporting when presented in that way.Today in Focus is going to be a bit experimental as we try things out with format, style and tone. In time, we will find the voice that we believe works best for us and as a platform for the . So please: come, try and (I hope) enjoy what we have to offer, but do also pile in with feedback and ideas.If you give us just 20 minutes of your time, we promise you will learn something relevant, interesting and new every day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/293f50c0db66a63507873cba201249dc46707ca9/0_0_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=690ff674e713349974224208526f4236","title":"is big pharma ignoring the poor","story":"Pharmaceutical companies are driven by profit.

Because, you know, right now, if you look at the deal, they may not be able to trade with us … I don’t think that the prime minister meant that. And, hopefully, she’ll be able to do something about that.”While May was speaking in the Commons, Julian Smith, the chief whip, confirmed to MPs that the make-or-break vote on her controversial Brexit deal would be held on 11 December after a marathon five-day Commons debate.Pressed as to whether she had an alternative, given the scale of political opposition against her, May instead called on MPs to consider carefully how they will vote. “I believe that it is important that when people come to that vote, they consider the interests of this country, they consider the interests of their constituents, and they consider the importance of delivering on Brexit,” she said.May was responding to a question from Conservative pro-remain backbencher Anna Soubry, who told her: “As it currently stands, the major of honourable and right honourable members will not vote in favour of the prime minister’s deal.”Soubry demanded to know “what is the prime minister’s plan B?” and asked whether she would follow the example of European Economic Area (EEA) member Norway “plus the single market, the customs union which some of us have been arguing for for two years”.Earlier, a jittery cabinet held a one-hour political session in which May and other ministers discussed selling the Brexit deal to MPs – and put them under pressure by making the case for her orce deal to a largely weary British public. Insiders said they were well aware of the task ahead of the prime minister to win the final approval vote.A  analysis says that 89 Tory MPs have publicly stated they will not, or are very unlikely to, vote for May’s final Brexit deal. “The number of MPs that there are is well understood,” a Downing Street spokesman added.On Tuesday, May will head to Wales in the morning before going to Belfast to meet the Democratic Unionist party, whose members have already said they are likely to vote against her deal. May will also meet members of Sinn Féin and other leading parties.A visit to Scotland is expected later in the week, which will be followed by trips in England in a week’s time, focused on selling the deal via regional and local media, after May returns from the G20 summit in Argentina on 30 November-1 December.If MPs reject the deal, there are seven possible paths the country could go down next.May brings it back to MPsPerhaps with minor tweaks after a dash to Brussels. ​MPs knuckle under and vote it through.May resigns immediatelyIt is\u0026nbsphard to imagine her surviving for long. After a rapid leadership contest, a different leader could appeal to a majority in parliament, perhaps by offering a softer deal.Tory backbenchers depose herJacob Rees-Mogg gets his way and there is a no-confidence vote. A new leader then tries to assemble a majority behind a tweaked deal.May calls a general electionMay could choose to take the ultimate gamble and hope that voters would back her deal, over the heads of squabbling MPs.Labour tries to force an electionThe opposition tables a vote of no confidence.\u0026nbsp​If May lost​,\u0026nbspthe opposition (or a new Conservative leader) would have two weeks to form an alternative government that could win a second confidence vote. If they were unable to do so, a general election would be triggered.A second referendum gathers supportThis is most likely if Labour makes a last-ditch decision to back it.\u0026nbspNo dealThe EU (Withdrawal) Act specifies 29 March 2019 as\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspday. Amber Rudd has said she believes parliament would stop a no deal, but it is not clear how it would do so.Cabinet ministers will be expected to come out in support of the deal, as it touches on their respective briefs, to demonstrate loyalty to an embattled May, although as many as nine members have had private conversations about pursuing a soft Brexit plan B if parliament rejects the prime minister’s Brexit deal.Five remain-backing ministers, including the de facto deputy prime minister, David Lidington, and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, are understood to have discussed staying in a customs union permanently. A further four ministers have held one-on-one talks on a Norway plus option with Tory MP Nick Boles.Lidington held a briefing for Labour MPs on Monday night, accompanied by May’s chief of staff Gavin Barwell, on the Brexit deal, which – prior to it commencing – was interpreted to be the first of several attempts to see if it will be possible to persuade opposition members worried about the risk of a no deal Brexit to support the government.However, No 10 played down speculation that May was prepared to participate in a primetime TV debate with Jeremy Corbyn over Brexit. One insider conceded: “There are a number of ideas that haven’t got off the ground.”Labour repeated that Corbyn was eager to debate “the prime minister’s botched Brexit and the future of our country” but the party said it had not yet been formally or informally approached by the Conservatives or a broadcaster.In the Commons debate, the former defence secretary Michael Fallon, normally considered loyal, said he had significant concerns about May’s Brexit deal. “Are we not being asked to take a huge gamble here: paying, leaving, surrendering our vote and our veto, without any firm commitment to frictionless trade, or the absolute right to dismantle external tariffs?” Fallon said. Boris Johnson warned that May was at risk of losing control of her cabinet under the pressure. “It’s very hard to see how this deal can command certainty to business or anyone else, when half the cabinet are going around assuring business that the UK is effectively going to remain in the customs union and single market,” the former foreign secretary said.It took more than an hour on Monday, and only after contributions from 32 other MPs, before May finally heard a supportive contribution, from the former education secretary, Nicky Morgan. She asked if May agreed that “it’s the easiest thing in the world for people to remain in their entrenched positions they’ve been in for the last two years?” The prime minister issued a thinly veiled warning to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who had suggested that the UK could be trapped in a customs union with the EU if it did not allow access to its fishing waters.May said that would be fiercely resisted: “The EU have maintained throughout this process that they want to link overall access to markets to access to fisheries,” she said.“They failed in the withdrawal agreement and they failed again in the political declaration. It is no surprise some are already trying to lay down markers again for the future relationship. They should be getting used to the answer by now: it is not going to happen.”A rare moment of contrition from May came when the SNP’s Philippa Whitford criticised May for saying EU nationals were able to “jump the queue” under current immigration rules last week. May apologised, saying: “I should not have used that language in that speech.” She said she had been trying to make the point that she wanted an immigration system based not on nationality but on the skills people could offer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89aa1015bba02c545af733ff0dab0db5f778aeea/450_441_3514_2109/master/3514.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=749bc20ce47818ec1781ca28ae0986fe","title":"labour to block peoples vote taking part in brexit tv debate jeremy corbyn","story":"Jeremy Corbyn keen to use live debate to confront prime minister on domestic policiesLabour will not allow a representative of the People’s Vote campaign to take part in any televised Brexit debate involving Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn, with the party instead pushing for a format that would allow the opposition leader to criticise the prime minister’s domestic policies.May’s team has proposed holding a live primetime TV debate ahead of a crunch parliamentary vote next month on Britain’s exit from the EU, prompting a discussion over the debate format and which broadcaster would host it.It also led to calls from parties that support a second EU referendum – including the Scottish National party, the Green party and the Liberal Democrats – to have a representative on the panel.Corbyn’s team swiftly jumped at the offer and confirmed their willingness to take part, saying: “Jeremy would relish a head-to-head debate with Theresa May about her botched Brexit deal and the future of our country.”Despite this, there is no certainty that Corbyn will be involved if Labour cannot agree terms with a broadcaster and No 10 in the next fortnight.Sources aware of Labour’s plans emphasised the party would only be willing to consider a debate that pitched the two main party leaders against each other, leaving no space for an proponent of a second referendum. Labour believes this format would also allow Corbyn to get May to broaden the debate beyond Brexit and hold her to account on issues such as austerity.Anti-Brexit groups called on broadcasters to insist on including a supporter of a second referendum.“While it is welcome that the prime minister is finally agreeing to turn up to a debate, the argument for the people to be given the final say on Brexit must be heard loud and clear in that discussion,” said the Best for Britain chief executive, Eloise Todd.One Downing Street source said formal talks with broadcasters had yet to begin, with questions around scheduling still to be decided. The BBC is the most likely home for a debate, but Sky News, Channel 4 and Channel 5 are among those who are thought to have expressed an interest in giving a platform to the prime minister.Discussion about the format of leaders’ debates has become a cornerstone of British politics over the past decade, with months spent trying to agree a debate format during the 2015 general election. Time pressure means political parties have a matter of days to come to an arrangement this time.The Daily  has been briefed that the prime minister favours holding a “primetime, Sunday night televised debate” with Corbyn, with a “Question Time-style session with a televised audience hosted by David Dimbleby” lined up if terms cannot be agreed with the Labour leader.However, Downing Street’s desire for a peak slot may come against the brutal reality of TV schedules. The prime minister’s team want the largest possible audience for such a debate, but the only logistically possible Sunday night that could work is 9 December, which could bring its own problems if they wish to appear on one of the biggest terrestrial channels.That evening, BBC One is set to show Countryfile, the season finales of Doctor Who and David Attenborough’s Dynasties, plus Strictly Come Dancing and a new drama by Jimmy McGovern. Meanwhile, ITV will be showing the final of I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here.It is unlikely that a sceptical audience settling down for Sunday night viewing would welcome any of the shows being interrupted or delayed, even for a political debate that could shape the future of Britain.Any leadership debate will also inevitably provide comparisons with the 2017 general election debates, where May declined to take part and instead sent Amber Rudd to deputise against Corbyn.During a Facebook Q\u0026ampA last year, she justified skipping the head-to-head contest with her Labour rival: “What I think is more important is actually that I and he take questions directly from the voters”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b918bcda48b3e7e5e5903173ef6cfc3de95b5703/90_36_2735_1641/master/2735.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da398ffc02ce0450fb75454db0ab23e9","title":"ministers consider backing norway plus as brexit plan b","story":"Soft Brexit option could be fallback if Commons rejects Theresa May’s dealAlmost half of Theresa May’s cabinet have held talks to weigh up the possibility of backing a soft Brexit option as a plan B if parliament rejects the prime minister’s EU withdrawal deal.Four cabinet ministers have held meetings to discuss the “Norway plus” plan amid concerns at the top of government that May will struggle to muster enough votes to get her proposals through the Commons.Five other, remain-backing ministers – David Lidington, Philip Hammond, Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark – are understood to have agreed to try to get the prime minister to support a softer departure from the EU.Their favoured option is believed to be staying in a permanent customs union, which is currently Labour policy, increasing the likelihood of the plan making it through the Commons. “We see that as the best way of guaranteeing frictionless trade if the deal falls,” one said.The group have been meeting weekly for some time, either at the Treasury or in their Commons offices, to discuss the government’s options if the deal is defeated. “They just don’t make as much of a fuss about it as their Brexit-supporting colleagues,” one source said.Nick Boles, a former minister and a leading advocate of a Norway-style departure from the EU, confirmed that he had spoken to four cabinet ministers, thought to include Michael Gove, a leading Brexiter, about his proposals.Supporters of the Norway plus campaign, which is pushing for the UK to join the European Free Trade Association (Efta) and have a customs arrangement with the EU, believe Tory MPs and ministers should start to apply pressure on May to swing behind it.The campaign for Norway plus has gathered momentum since the SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, and the DUP’s Arlene Foster – who have both said their parties would not support May’s deal – indicated in recent days they would consider the option.“Everyone is looking for a plan B. There is gathering momentum for Norway plus. We are seeing the makings of a parliamentary majority,” Boles told the .“We have to take on the chin that the EU have said they won’t negotiate the withdrawal agreement. But they might be prepared to renegotiate the political declaration.”Boles has also held talks with Labour MPs, 75 of whom defied party instructions to abstain from voting for European Economic Area (EEA) membership in June.He hopes the majority could be persuaded to back his plan, although a number have now come out for a second referendum.He said: “Labour MPs want to be able to fulfil their obligations to their leadership and party members before being asked to support Norway plus. That’s why it needs to be a fallback plan that comes into play after all the votes have happened and all other avenues have been closed off.”However, even supporters of the Norway plus plan acknowledge it would present difficulties for the prime minister, whose key Brexit red line is to end freedom of movement. Efta members are obliged to admit workers from elsewhere in the EEA.Supporters argue, however, that the “emergency brake” that exists for members would allow the UK to cap migration in extreme circumstances, while the government has begun registering all EEA nationals already in the UK, meaning that if they fail to find work within a few months, it will be able to remove them.May’s official spokesman said: “The prime minister believes the deal that she has delivered is the right one for the country and one of the main reasons for that is that it allows us to take back control on our borders by ending freedom of movement.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/712c72b4522af5cfef11fe6fc38f78c572ab5feb/0_297_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64f8a45ff0c3e60b8045ba1ecdba4484","title":"pms new brexit mantra everything is agreed although nothing is agreed","story":"Isolated and forlorn, Theresa May endures yet another Commons pile-on by MPsThere are now only two possibilities left. Either no one has told Theresa May the result of last year’s general election and she is under the impression she has a 100-seat majority in the Commons. Or she simply cannot count. Whichever it is, we’re long past the point where the prime minister’s much-prized fortitude and stoicism has slipped into pig-headedness and outright stupidity.Or possibly madness. If insanity is repeating the same mistake and expecting a different result, then the prime minister is in urgent need of clinical help. Not content with having come to the Commons twice in the past week to give a statement on the Brexit withdrawal agreement and the future declaration, which has been rubbished by almost everyone in Britain, May was back for a third time after the weekend’s EU council meeting to make exactly the same case as before. And to receive precisely the same overwhelmingly hostile reaction.There was a time when May used to endlessly repeat: “Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.” At some point over the past few weeks, her default settings have been rerouted to: “Everything has been agreed when nothing has been agreed.” No one should get hung up on the backstop arrangements that have been agreed because everyone had privately agreed they should never be used. This was the best deal because it was the only deal. People wanted certainty and she was giving them the guaranteed certainty of prolonged uncertainty. She sat down to near silence from her own benches.Jeremy Corbyn replied using almost the exact same words he had used in his last two outings at the dispatch box. If the prime minister couldn’t be bothered to make an effort, then why should he? Her deal was a bad deal because it delivered a Brexit that was simultaneously too hard and too soft. Sooner or later someone is going to point out to him he can’t have it both ways. Or perhaps not. At the moment, all that’s required of him is to be one step ahead of May. Something the average 10-year-old can manage.Then came the inevitable pile-on. From the usual suspects, called by the speaker in the same predictable order. Iain Duncan Smith, David Davis, Bill Cash and John Redwood. Anna Soubry briefly livened things up by pointing out that, since it was obvious the prime minister’s plan stood no chance of getting through parliament, it would be interesting to know if she had a plan B. May was outraged. It had been hard enough work trying to sign off a 600-page document that everyone hated, so expecting her to come up with something that people actually liked was out the question.Nor was there any respite from the Labour benches as Hilary Benn, Yvette Cooper, Chris Leslie and Rachel Reeves asked questions to which the prime minister had no answer. There was no point in having a second referendum because you couldn’t trust the people to come up with the answer you wanted. And it was completely absurd to argue that the UK would be worse off by leaving the EU, because there were so many other ways to measure prosperity than people being broke. Just think of the feelgood factor of dressing in rags. Blessed are the poor, for they shall disinherit Northern Ireland and Gibraltar.One hour into the statement and not a single MP had spoken in support of her deal. Even Michael Fallon, normally one of May’s most loyal of sidekicks, put the boot in. Then Dominic Grieve observed that May’s “People’s Letter” was riddled with inaccuracies. May looked bewildered. She’d always assumed the electorate enjoyed being lied to. The first vague hint of support came from Caroline Spelman. Wrong time, wrong person. Spelman is already a dame, so can’t be bought off with honours. May passed a note to the chief whip, Julian Smith, most likely a reminder to him to bung a few hundred thousand to Spelman’s West Midlands constituency for pothole repairs. Brexit was getting to be an expensive business.Long before the end, May cut an increasingly isolated and forlorn figure. A prime minister out of time, out of her depth and out of ideas. Praying on a miracle that was never going to come. Going home every evening to curl in a foetal ball, howling a primal scream of despair. Knowing that this was merely the beginning of a two-week period that could only end in humiliation and failure. This time, nothing really had changed. There might not have been a method in her madness. But there sure as hell was a madness in her method."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be2934e646649e4b95e671861260003ce764629e/93_32_1725_1035/master/1725.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b289418fcd8890a10bf0e69b1704bf4","title":"brexit may commons statement economy would be 4 smaller after 10 years under mays brexit plan says report politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May’s statement to MPs about yesterday’s EU Brexit summitHere are the main points from the prime minister’s Commons statement:Last week, the prime minister managed to insult and upset over 3 million European citizens who live and work in this country. Over 150,000 of them, like my German husband, a GP here for over 30 years, felt absolutely thrown away when they have spent decades here looking after us when we’re ill. Will the prime minister take this opportunity perhaps to apologise for her thoughtless and insulting comments?I should not have used that language in that speech. The point I was making was a simple one … I think there was a point that for most people here in the United Kingdom, they want to see people coming to this country with the skills and wanting to make a contribution – her husband has made a contribution as a GP here in this country. The EU have maintained throughout this process that they want to link overall access to markets to access to fisheries. They failed in the withdrawal agreement and they failed again in the political declaration. It is no surprise some are already trying to lay down markers again for the future relationship. They should be getting used to the answer by now: it is not going to happen.Put simply, there is no deal that comes without a backstop, and without a backstop there is no deal.Furthermore, as a result of the changes we have negotiated, the legal text is now also clear that once the backstop has been superseded, it shall “cease to apply”. So if a future parliament decided to then move from an initially deep trade relationship to a looser one, the backstop could not return. I’m tempted to say this, though … I think it would be an interesting debate for this house, the extent to which economic forecasts can actually be described as facts.The question as to our future. I do believe that we can be better off outside the European Union. But the problem is there are those who think that the only factor that determines how well off we are in the future is whether or not we are members of the European Union. I differ. Our future in our hands. It will be our decisions in many areas that will determine our prosperity for the future.Our message to the people of Gibraltar is clear: we will always stand by you, we are proud Gibraltar is British, and our position on sovereignty has not and will not change.That’s all from me for today.Thanks for the comments.Martin Vickers, a Conservative, asks about the reference to social security payments in the political declaration. (See here for more on this issue.) How much would this cost the UK?May says she was referring to this when she answered a question earlier. (See 5.49pm.)After two hours and 36 minutes, John Bercow, the Speaker, winds up the session.I will post a summary soon.Ross Thomson, a Scottish Conservative, says he campaigned heart and soul to keep the UK together in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. But this deal would leave Northern Ireland under EU control in some respects. As a passionate unionist, he cannot accept that.May says she is also a passionate unionist. She says Northern Ireland already has different rules from GB in some respects. And she says in some respects the backstop could benefit Northern Ireland.The SNP’s Drew Hendry asks about today’s NIESR report on the impact of May’s Brexit deal, and in particular what it says about the impact on the government’s tax revenues. (See 9.19am.) So how can May justify her promises about NHS spending?May says this was addressed in the budget.Mark Pawsey, a Conservative, says he has also been knocking on doors in his constituency. People voted for Brexit so they could control immigration. But businesses want to protec their supply chains. May’s deal delivers on both, he says.David Duguid, a Scottish Conservative, says the chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation has backed the deal. (See 9.53am.) Yet other people criticise it. Who should people believe?May says the Scottish Fishermen’s Association probably know more about this than the SNP. Richard Drax, a Conservative, says the deal is a halfway house leaving the UK half in and half out. Wouldn’t it better to leave, and then negotiate a new deal?May says the deal she is negotiating will be better than any other free trade deal with the EU.This is from Channel 4 News’ Michael Crick.Labour’s Martin Whitfield asks if people who get state pensions but live in EU countries will get them uprated annually after Brexit, and after the transition, as if they were living in the UK.May says this issue is addressed in the declaration on the future relationship.Kevin Hollinrake, a Conservative, says the backstop is also uncomfortable for the EU. So it will want to bring it to an end as soon as possible. May agrees, and says that is why it is in the interests of both sides to end it as soon as possible.The SNP’s Patrick Grady says he was disappointed to read on Twitter the timetable for the debate before the government announced it. (See 5.15pm.)Nick Herbert, a Conservative former minister, says the backstop can only be temporary. So comments about being stuck in it are wrong, he says. He says the agreement delivers on what people voted for.Victoria Prentis, a Conservative, says the leaflet sent to all homes during the EU referendum said the government would enact whatever people voted for.May says people should remember that commitment.Labour’s Matt Western asks what May’s own backstop is if she lose the vote.May says she has answered that already.(By which she means she has already not answered the question she just refuses to speculate on that might happen if she loses.)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51a7ec46e7f559fba9558f038cac3120166cbbc9/1_89_1515_909/master/1515.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b821da687821dd7502d1536da5cc785","title":"misinformation word of the year dictionarycom","story":"Online resource picked the word over ‘disinformation’ where other dictionaries had opted for ‘toxic’ and ‘single-use’“Misinformation”, as opposed to disinformation, is Dictionary’s word of the year. It followed “toxic”, picked for the same honor by Oxford Dictionaries, and “single-use”, picked by Collins.Jane Solomon, a linguist-in-residence at Dictionary, said the choice of “mis” over “dis” was deliberate, intended to serve as a “call to action” to be vigilant in the battle against fake news, flat earthers and anti-vaxxers, among other conduits.The Oakland-based company wanted to highlight the idea of intent to mislead, and that misinformation can be spread unwittingly.“The rampant spread of misinformation is really providing new challenges for navigating life in 2018,” Solomon said. “Misinformation has been around for a long time, but over the last decade or so the rise of social media has really, really changed how information is shared. We believe that understanding the concept of misinformation is vital to identifying misinformation as we encounter it in the wild, and that could ultimately help curb its impact.”In studying lookups on the site, Dictionary noticed “our relationship with truth is something that came up again and again”, Solomon said.For example, the word “mainstream” spiked in January as the term “mainstream media”, or MSM, grew to gargantuan proportions, wielded as an insult on the political right. There was a surge in February for “white lie”, after Hope Hicks, then White House communications director, admitted to telling a few for Donald Trump.The word “Orwellian” surfaced in May, after a statement attributed to White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, accused the Chinese government of “Orwellian nonsense”.Misinformation, Solomon said, “frames what we’ve all been through in the last 12 months”. The site, which has 90 million monthly users, has added entries for “filter bubble”, “fake news”, “post-fact”, “post-truth” and “homophily”, among others. Other entries have been freshened to reflect new meanings, including “echo chamber”.The company’s runners-up include “representation”, driven by the popularity of the movies Black Panther and Crazy Rich Asians and wins in the US midterm elections for female, Muslim, Native American and LGBT candidates.But the rise of misinformation, Solomon said, stretches well beyond US borders. The use of Facebook and other social media to incite violence and conflict was documented around the globe in 2018, she said.“Disinformation would have also been a really, really interesting word of the year this year, but our choice of misinformation was very intentional,” Solomon said.“Disinformation is a word that kind of looks externally to examine the behavior of others. It’s sort of like pointing at behavior and saying, ‘THIS is disinformation.’ With misinformation, there is still some of that pointing, but also it can look more internally to help us evaluate our own behavior, which is really, really important in the fight against misinformation.“It’s a word of self-reflection, and in that it can be a call to action. You can still be a good person with no nefarious agenda and still spread misinformation.”In 2016, Dictionary chose “complicit” as its word of the year. In 2016, it was “xenophobia”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a65e303566a0dfe0c602f1a9b5e6910488d211bc/0_184_5370_3222/master/5370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8eab637a0b80cc0aadfcde949983b1bf","title":"prehistoric remains mammoth tusks woolly rhino","story":"Digging alongside the bulldozers of the £1.5bn road ersion, archaeologists have discovered tonnes of ancient bones. Is there a find so important that it could stop the whole project?A small crowd of workers gathers outside a temporary office plonked in a muddy field in Cambridgeshire. Bill Boismier flips down the back door of his pickup truck and reaches inside. Earlier this morning, the American-born archaeologist, who has steeped himself in British soil for more than 40 years, was up to his knees in a nearby pit to retrieve the find he is now unwrapping. “What is it?” asks a site cleaner who, like everyone else here, is dressed head-to-toe in hi-vis safety gear. “Is it … a dinosaur?”“Not quite,” Boismier, who is 65, tells the group. His grey ponytail is tied back with a rubber band and his face reveals a life spent outdoors. “But it is an ancient species. It could be more than 130,000 years old.” The leg bone, still caked in mud and roughly the height and weight of a five-year-old child, belonged to a woolly mammoth. The elephant-sized beast once roamed the land that is now just south of the Fenstanton Travelodge, at junction 27 of the A14.The mammoth bone is the freshest find at Britain’s biggest current road-building site. Archaeologists predicted that the £1.5bn project to ert the A14 around Huntingdon, just north of Cambridge, would be fruitful dig up 12.5 miles of Fenland for a new motorway and you can expect to find some things. But the hordes of archaeologists who have worked ahead of – and alongside – the bulldozers have been astonished to document the treasure beneath their feet.Boismier jumps in another truck with Dai Davies, a burly Welsh earth mover, for the short drive to borrow pit 3. Rather than truck thousands of tonnes of gravel and earth across the country for the project, which also includes the widening of a further 10 miles of the existing A14 and A1, several temporary quarries, or “borrow pits”, have been dug in neighbouring fields. It was in the third of these that, in October, one of Davies’s digger operators struck palaeontological gold.At the far end of the pit, Boismier and Davies step out of their truck to join Steve Sherlock, a Yorkshire-born ground sleuth who oversees the archaeological work. Such is its scale – and the strict planning requirements attached to it – that Sherlock, 64, has had to coordinate some 250 archaeologists. Before work began in 2016, research including hi-tech geophysical surveys identified sites for detailed excavation. Sherlock’s teams have uncovered whole medieval and Anglo-Saxon villages, as well as an ornate 8th-century comb made of deer antler, dozens of Roman brooches and a bone flute.But meticulously excavating sites as large as borrow pit 3 using pick-hammers and trowels would make large projects impossible to achieve. The quarry, which Davies manages, is a small cog in a giant roadbuilding machine, yet it is an awesome sight. Giant industrial pumps at the perimeter work day and night to keep the water table at bay as more than a dozen machines excavate and move earth in a kind of digger ballet. It is a scene of temporary mass destruction (the pits will be returned to fields afterwards) but the men and women behind the controls at this site have a dual role.“He’s looking at the moment for a different colour when he’s digging,” Davies says as he points at the nearest digger. Before its driver sinks his bucket into the ground to pull up more than three tonnes of earth, he draws its toothed edge carefully over the surface. A darkening in the earth might indicate the presence of something significant, and the need for a more detailed look. While digging like this last month, Davies’s team created national headlines. They found a pair of mammoth tusks and, rarer still, the intact skull of a woolly rhino. “You tell people down the pub you’ve found a mammoth tusk and they say ‘no you haven’t’ and you have to show them a picture,” Davies says in a Welsh lilt. “It’s not something you encounter every day, is it?”For Sherlock and Boismier, the intended benefits of the road project, which Highways England hopes will improve traffic flow between East Anglia and the Midlands, are secondary to the opportunity it presents. There would be no other reason, in the fairly featureless Fens, to dig giant holes to a depth of four metres. Yet there is no other way to peel back so many layers of history.Boismier tries to conjure the landscape here when the mammoths and rhinos roamed, centuries before humans changed it all. He describes a fast-flowing, icy river – which left the gravel now incorporated in the new roads – sweeping away all but the heaviest remains of animals. There were no trees and much of England was bound by glaciers and ice sheets. “You see some of the greyish blue clay there,” Boismier says, pointing at giant clumps of earth pulled from the deepest pits, below the gravel. “The dinosaurs were alive when that was deposited.”But undertaking this kind of archaeology is often fraught: a race against the machines. Sherlock, who has worked on road projects since 2003, is the middle man. He works for Highways England and has managed 33 excavation sites while also working with dozens of contractors who are, among other things, building more than 30 new bridges, each of which requires deep foundations. “If an archaeologist says to a contractor, ‘Oh, that won’t take long,’ the contractor thinks they’ll go off and have a cup of tea and it’ll be done,” he explains. “But ‘not long’ for an archaeologist might be two weeks.”Boismier, who exudes a seen-it-all wryness, is positive about the cooperation on his latest project. Yet he blanches when asked what might happen if one of Davies’s diggers hit a dinosaur. “I’ll go home and not come back,” he says, laughing. He wouldn’t, of course, but it’s clear that the odd mammoth tusk or rhino skull, while rare and remarkable, is about as excitable as the team here wants to get. “This is a watching brief,” Boismier adds. “You’re going around with the works to try and get things recorded, not trying to disrupt, and then moving on.”What would it take, in terms of archaeological significance, to really throw a project as big as this off course? “Oh you’d have to find the Neanderthal man with a mammoth footprint right on him,” Boismier says. “But that’s not going to happen.” The woolly rhino skull will do nicely. It and the woolly mammoth went extinct more than 10,000 years ago and the rhino skulls have a honeycomb structure that means they rarely survive intact. “To get a complete one is just amazing,” Boismier says. “At first we didn’t know what it was.”Hanging over Sherlock, Boismier and Davies (who deserve their own sitcom, by the way) is a major deadline. A previous version of this project first hit drawing boards in 2005, only to be axed by the government in 2010 because of its enormous cost. The current scheme won approval in May 2016 and is due to be completed in December 2020. Mola Headland Infrastructure (MHI), a joint venture including Museum of London Archaeology, got the contract to do the archaeology.Even recruiting the archaeologists has been a challenge they are in short supply, Sherlock says. Last summer, MHI had to scoop-up archaeology graduates by the dozen and put them on an eight-week training course. The call went out globally, and almost three-quarters of the team has been foreign. At one point, Sherlock got in a team of 20 from Rome. “And they were digging Roman sites of course, some of the time,” he says.Yet managing the living has been a logistical cinch compared with the mammoth task of dealing with the dead. The team has pulled up more than seven tonnes of bone, including some human remains, and about the same weight in pottery alone. What do you do with all that stuff? When Davies’s digger operator found the tusks and skull, he brushed them off and set them aside, pausing only for minutes before climbing back into his machine. The next time Boismier was at the borrow pit, he retrieved them, bagged them in plastic and took them to a large MHI field centre in nearby St Neots. All the finds, including those from the archaeological digs where the team has more time to work, have been processed there and loaded into large plastic boxes before being trucked down the A1 to Mola’s HQ.The large grey building is wedged between a self-storage centre and a Royal Mail sorting office in east London. A few days after Davies proudly surveyed his borrow pit, Liz Goodman, a conservator at MHI, is standing over a large table in a harshly lit workshop. She wears blue latex gloves. The mammoth tusks sit next to the skull, bits of mud and gravel still sticking to them, and water pooling on the plastic sheeting. It’s like a scene from CSI Ice Age, except that Goodman’s headache is not to establish a cause of death but to work out how to stop the finds disintegrating. Mammoth ivory is layered up as cones within cones. The tusks have been saturated in wet earth for thousands of years. Drying them out would cause the layers to separate. “They would just sort of slowly explode,” Goodman says.A find like this in Britain is so rare that Goodman is having to research her options. The crates the team has to store items in water aren’t big enough. Plastic bags doused with water work for now, but water alone would also eventually threaten the ivory, its high surface tension effectively pulling it apart over time. “We’re going to substitute water for alcohol because its surface tension is much less, but the quantities of alcohol you need get quite interesting,” Goodman says.Mola is also having to draw up security measures for the tusks. Bans on trading elephant ivory have, over the years, created a market for the mammoth alternative, typically using tusks pulled in greater numbers from Siberia. “I’m suddenly realising all these new things I need to worry about,” says Goodman, who is used to dealing with smaller fragments. She has not yet opened the box that contains Boismier’s mammoth leg.Upstairs, specialists are processing some of the artefacts retrieved from the A14 project. Lyn Blackmore is excited about the unusually ornate comb. It’s stored in foam in a small box, and came from a lost Anglo-Saxon village Sherlock’s team excavated near Brampton, a village on the route of the Huntingdon bypass. “I’ve never seen one so fancy,” she says of the 8th- or 9th-century object. Most of its fine teeth are still attached to a beautifully carved handle.A few desks across the large open-plan office, Rachel Cubitt is looking at an x-ray of a number of Roman brooches from another excavation site. It reveals the fine spring one of them contained for fastening a cloak. In another brooch, coloured enamel decoration is still visible. “We’re used to projects in London, but large parts of this area of England have never been touched, archaeologically,” she says. “This is a fantastic opportunity to understand large swathes of the countryside.”Back on the project, the bulk of the detailed excavation has now been completed. But at the borrow pit, Davies is optimistic that he may yet discover more big bones. For him, working with Boismier and Sherlock has been eye-opening. He has a new-found respect for archaeologists, having observed them up to their neck in mud on winter days that would make a woolly rhino shiver. “I’ve also seen things on this project I don’t think I’ll ever see again,” Davies says, revelling in a new interest in history. “I was in Cambridge the other day and I’ve nearly gone into the archaeology museum,” he says, laughing. “They’ve nearly broken me.”• This article was altered on 26 November 2018 to correct two references to “architect” that should have read “archaeologist”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3672779500ab9711449c15643811589ade4f568c/0_0_3620_2172/master/3620.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6d09be15f11206d6d41eac9528c8735","title":"uk firm sold spinal implants disintegrated","story":"Plastic discs that also moved in some patients were only tested on 30 people in six monthsA UK company’s spinal implants that allegedly moved and eroded in patients, and which are at the centre of legal action, have highlighted potential weaknesses in the way in which some medical devices enter the market, an investigation has revealed.Documents seen by the  show the plastic discs were approved for sale by the British Standards Institution (BSI) after tests on 30 people over six monthsA customised version was also implanted in nine baboons, according to a paper by members of the company’s own scientific advisory board.The devices, made by the now-defunct Ranier Technology, which was based in Cambridge, are the focus of legal action brought by prosecutors in Germany against a doctor who implanted them, allegedly without first obtaining fully informed patient consent.Many of the patients who received them are undergoing surgery to have them removed, with doctors finding some had completely disintegrated, according to an investigation coordinated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, involving the  and BBC’s Panorama.Ranier Technology was granted CE (Conformité Européenne) safety marks for two implants, Cadisc-L and Cadisc-C. The devices were certified by the BSI in 2010 and 2011 respectively, and once approved were marketed to hospitals across Europe.The firm gained millions of pounds in backing from investors impressed by its work in developing artificial spinal discs, which it said would bring relief and a normal quality of life to patients suffering degenerative disc disease.We want to hear from readers to find out more about your experiences and perspectives on\u0026nbspthe story.You can get in touch by filling in this encrypted form.

The documents seen by the  show that in trials on baboons using a custom-sized version of Cadisc-L the discs had all been put in the wrong place.A 2009 review of some of the animals noted that “overall six months is a relatively short time to follow an implant up”, but even after that time there appeared “to be worrying changes between the implant and the bone in all but one subject”.Details of the tests on humans have not been published, but it is known they only ran for six months before the CE mark application, even though the implants were aimed at young patients.The case raises questions about the different standards applied by regulators around the world.The documents reveal Ranier Technology chose to seek approval in Europe first because it was easier than doing so in the USA, and that it hoped to use the CE mark to help it get the approval of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). “Like Cadisc-L, the regulatory strategy for Cadisc-C is to penetrate Europe first and follow up in the USA … On the whole the regulatory process and required testing tends to be more stringent in the US compared with the EU.”Regulators in other European countries approved clinical tests, and patients were recruited in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands.The investigations ran from October 2009 until June 2010, and by August 2010 the company had a CE mark for Cadisc-L.The BSI would not comment on Ranier Technology’s application, citing confidentiality requirements.The documents show the FDA asked for more data to back up the company’s approval application. The regulator was concerned about the misplacement of the device in the baboon study and asked the company to provide “a breakdown of changes made to the device, instrumentation, and surgical technique as a result of ‘lessons learned’”.Ranier Technology was dissolved this year.  put a number of questions to the company’s former chief executive Dr Geoffrey Andrews.In a statement, he said the Cadisc-L devices used in humans were not the ones used in tests on baboons. The baboons were implanted with a much smaller custom-made version of the device.“For clarification, no Cadisc-L devices were implanted in any animal,” he said. “Ranier spent over eight years and more than £20m in the design, development and testing of Cadisc-L. The research, development and testing involved many top experts from across the world.” Andrews said the testing complied with the relevant standards and included checks “to replicate long-term usage and which predicted a 40-year service life for Cadisc-L”.He said clinical tests in patients had gone very well, with good outcomes after the first four years. It was after four patients had to undergo further surgery that the company “decided unilaterally, and as a precaution, to formally withdraw Cadisc-L from the market, which it did on 31 March 2014”.In Germany, a case against a doctor was filed late last year alleging assault against 53 patients who had the device implanted. He has denied the allegations. There is no action against Ranier Technology."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92e98d54f3d411d57d0cf377abec2a4e3cccb742/0_230_6894_4136/master/6894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28989466dcc5fb6a68b0d47795909c03","title":"tell us do you work in a food bank share your stories","story":"If you work in a food bank in the UK, we’d like to hear from you.

Had England not crashed out of their home Rugby World Cup in the 2015 pool stages, Farrell would probably still be at Twickenham and modern rugby history might look very different. Talk about sliding doors.In retrospect Eddie Jones’s decision not to retain Stuart Lancaster’s erstwhile assistant when he had the chance in December 2015 will go down among the more generous Anglo-Irish gifts on record. By the time Jones tried to woo back the former Great Britain rugby league captain earlier this year, it was too late. In company with Joe Schmidt, Farrell has helped construct the most formidable Ireland squad of all time, as reflected in their clean sweep at this year’s World Rugby awards.And why not? Everywhere he has played and coached, Farrell has been a winner far more often than not. He was captaining Great Britain at rugby league at 21, scored over 3,000 points in 370 games for Wigan, was the youngest player ever to taste victory in a Challenge Cup final at 17 years 11 months and became only the second British player, after Ellery Hanley, to be crowned world player of the year. As the defence coach on the last two British and Irish Lions tours, he has yet to lose a series.Players, not least in Ireland, love him for two main reasons. Firstly, he has walked the walk, which always commands respect. Perhaps even more significantly he speaks their language. It is years ago now that a vastly experienced former national head coach told me the recently retired Farrell was an absolute natural in terms of simple and effective communication. When he talks players listen and, more often than not, make a mental note never to let him down.His famous “We are taking them boys to the hurt arena” speech before the third Lions Test in Sydney in 2013 is just one example of the uncompromising Wigan attitude drummed into him from the moment he made his debut aged 16 against Keighley. “It was definitely fear-driven,” he once told me. “You knew you were going to get it on Monday if you’d made a mistake. From day one you learned to know your job and to work as hard as you possibly could.”He has also come a long way from his days as an apprentice joiner “on £30 a week” for Wigan council but, from the age of 21, he knew he wanted to be a head coach. He had seen how Wigan’s Graham Lowe and John Monie operated and had plenty of his own ideas too. “I wrote stuff down from all the coaches I’ve had in my career. I suppose that’s the type of player I was. I was never an inidual player, I was always a team player. I was always a captain. It was always about how teams gelled together. I was fortunate as a player that I loved training, watching videos. I don’t see it as work, I see it as a pleasure.”He also had a short spell under Jones at Saracens and, as befits a man who once won rugby league’s Man of Steel and Golden Boot awards in the same year, has never been a one-trick pony. “Andy was a warrior who led from the front and took no prisoners but he was a great tactician as well,” recalled Phil Larder, the man who appointed him Great Britain captain. Pressure does not faze Farrell when you have had to run for your life pursued by an angry crowd in Papua New Guinea, as he did in 1996, the Aviva Stadium is child’s play. “We were chased around the field with sticks. We had to try to jump on a minibus, to get away at the end. The minibus was backed up to the gates, the gates opened and we all had to pile on. People were hitting the side of it and we were saying: ‘Go, go, go!’”With Irish heritage on both his and his wife’s side of the family – one of his brothers, Phil, represented Ireland at rugby league in 2003 – he has hinted he feels more at home in Dublin than he ever did at Twickenham. Given his son Owen is now leading England, however, the Farrell effect is now a multinational phenomenon. The rugby world will be fascinated to see what unfolds when Ireland host England on the first weekend of the 2019 Six Nations championship but in the Farrell household – “He’s a professional, I’m a professional. You do your job, don’t you?” – it will be business as usual. Anyone hoping Ireland will be a softer touch without Schmidt is doomed to disappointment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1cfcdfc2aeaef943f7f12ddc0fc2ed7341db60a/11_60_3420_2052/master/3420.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f2ac90e2e8092d88de6175cf2e7ff0f","title":"rfu accounts reveal loss and redundancy of 54 staff members","story":"The Rugby Football Union has predicted “growing uncertainty” and “challenging times” after its annual accounts revealed a £30.9m loss and the forced redundancy of 54 staff members.Speaking on Monday, the chief executive, Steve Brown, insisted he was leaving his post, having announced he was doing so earlier this month, for his “own reasons” and not because the RFU is in bad financial shape.“I think the RFU is in a superb place and is in great shape to adapt to whatever comes in the years ahead,” he said. But Brown did admit the organisation needs to “pull back a bit” in terms of future investment and make “adjustments”.The reason for this was spelled out by the RFU chairman, Andy Cosslett, in his introduction to the 2017-18 financial statement. After seven years of revenue growth in a “buoyant market”, Cosslett explained, the “situation is changing and market conditions have been getting tougher”.Cosslett did not mention Brexit but he did say the overall financial outlook was uncertain and the sports-rights market is tightening. But he also suggested that the RFU had overpaid when it signed a £200m, eight-year agreement with the professional clubs to compensate them for international call-ups.“We have to accept we signed some long-term commitments with the professional game which, while strategically important, now appear costly against updated revenue forecasts … they will reduce our discretionary investment going forward,” wrote Cosslett."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53e21439bd22d33f3466ec9ee143e9fe3438b5f2/0_165_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da1ef9a19bba6097d8fb93d88d587d36","title":"womens t20 cricket included 2022 commonwealth games","story":"Women’s T20 cricket is strongly in the running to be admitted as a new sport to the schedule at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in 2022.A joint bid between the International Cricket Council and England and Wales Cricket Board was submitted last week before a vital presentation to the organising committee of the event next Monday. If an endorsement is won at that stage, the Commonwealth Games Federation will then make the final decision, to be ratified by September next year.According to the submission, Edgbaston would be the primary venue for the eight-team competition, with county grounds at Worcester, Derbyshire and Leicester under consideration to serve as the secondary host during the group stages.That each of the games would be broadcast live on BBC television has been described as “an absolute game-changer” by Clare Connor, the director of England Women’s Cricket. She has been steering the process from an ECB perspective in collaboration with an ICC working group led by Iain Higgins, the governing body’s chief operating officer.“One of the things we have noticed is the more we have worked on this, the more passionate and committed people have become,” Connor told the .“People really tune into Olympic and Commonwealth Games, watching sports they normally wouldn’t watch and are inspired by them. So it would be a different audience from a typical cricket tournament. So the benefits for women’s cricket are very obvious.”The sport stood a strong chance of admission for the original host city for 2022, Durban. When the shift to Birmingham was decided upon at the start of 2018, the formal process started again. Sports that are seeking admission alongside women’s cricket are archery, shooting, para-table tennis and volleyball but they will not be competing for a fixed number of spots – the organising committee can give the green light to any contender that meets its criteria.“I hope our bid will be strong because it fits with what the Commonwealth Games are looking to do around equality,” she said. “One of their three core values is equality and they are, like most organisations or sports in a healthy place, looking to create more opportunities for female athletes and this would mean eight teams of female athletes. It is also really powerful that women’s cricket could be in on its own, standing there in its own right.”The top-eight ranked T20 sides would be granted qualification. The complication, as it was in 1998, is West Indies, who represent several nations. It is understood they would be asked to nominate one country from the region to take part as an imperfect solution to the problem.The paperwork submitted the Friday before last will be augmented with a series of visual presentations next Monday and Tuesday to Birmingham 2022 decision-makers. Mindful of how important this will be, the ICC will be represented by David Richardson, their chief executive. The board of the organisation has already given the bid its full support.“We have submitted a really strong case,” Connor said. “We are a sport with such an amazing heritage but are also looking to be modern and be dynamic and inclusive too, just as the Commonwealth are. We are a sport that is constantly proving itself and growing in audience, fans and media engagement. So for all those reasons, I am confident. We have a chance to stand in front of them next week and really bring this to life.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccd812f30e2d747abb8a6b32d99017c8dc058b55/0_222_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15ae41670d35163f8ecbf34cd90fc82e","title":"world chess championship game 12 carlsen caruana","story":"The world championship tilt between Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana will be decided in a quickfire tie-breaker after Monday’s Game 12 ended in a 31-move draw. The result shocked onlookers in light of the champion’s advantages in position and time, and left the best-of-12-games match in a historic 6-6 deadlock.The latest bloodless result, the 12th draw between the world’s top two players in as many contests, ensured the €1m ($1.14m) showdown in London will go down as the first title match in which no decisive results were managed in the official 132-year history of world championship play.Carlsen, 27, has been ranked No 1 for eight straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he defeated Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Caruana, 26, is ranked No 2, having earned his place at the table by winning the candidates tournament in March. No American-born player has won or even competed for the world title since Bobby Fischer in 1972.\u0026nbspIt marks the first title match between the world\u0027s top two players since 1990, when Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov faced off for a fifth and final time.\u0026nbspThe match will consist of 12 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches six and a half points first will be declared the champion.The time control for each game is 100 minutes for the first 40 moves, 50 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 1. Players cannot agree to a draw before Black\u0027s 30th move.\u0026nbspIf the match is tied after 12 games, tie-breaks will be played on the final day in the following order:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• Best of four rapid games with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• If still tied, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment).\u0026nbsp• If all five mini-matches are drawn, one sudden-death \u0027Armegeddon\u0027 match will be played where White receives five minutes and Black receives four minutes.

The tiebreak will consist of a best-of-four rapid match with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move. If that’s not enough to break the deadlock, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment). If all five mini-matches are drawn, it will come down to one sudden-death ‘Armegeddon’ match in which white receives five minutes and black receives four minutes and both will receive a three-second increment after the 60th move. If that game is drawn, black will be declared the winner.Carlsen, who in addition to his No 1 ranking is the world’s top-rated rapid player and top-rated blitz player (compared to Caruana’s respective ratings of No 8 and No 16), is widely regarded as a strong favorite in the format, not least due to a 13-year unbeaten record in tie-breakers. But no less than Garry Kasparov said on Monday that Carlsen’s hasty draw offer betrayed a lapse of nerve in the reigning champion.“In light of this shocking draw offer from Magnus in a superior position with more time, I reconsider my evaluation of him being the favorite in rapids,” the longtime world No 1 wrote on Twitter. “Tiebreaks require tremendous nerves and he seems to be losing his.”Caruana, as white, played into the Sveshnikov variation in Monday’s classical finale, as he did in the eighth and 10th games. Carlsen was first to deviate from those lines with 8. ... Ne7 and Caruana quickly fell behind on time after the champion played a novelty with 12. ... h5.The 26-year-old American challenger was offered a chance for a draw by repetition shortly after (13. Qa4 Bd7 14. Qb4 Bf5) but bravely opted to play on with 15. Be3. Yet Caruana’s temporal problems compounded over the next few moves (15. ... a6 16. Nc3 Qc7 17. g3 Be7 18. f3 Nf8 19. Ne4 Nd7 20. Bd3) and he soon found himself nearly 50 minutes behind on the clock.After Carlsen castled following a 12-minute think (20. ... O-O), Caruana delivered a surprise move (21. Rh2!?) that cost him in the opinion of the evaluation engines, but earned praise from the Russian grandmaster Alexander Grischuk from the commentary booth: “The deepest move in the match so far,” he said.Even after the champion expended another 10 minutes before playing 21. ... Rac8, Carlsen was ahead in development with more than a half-hour advantage in time. He pressed the initiative with 22. ... Bg6 23. Rc2 f5 and Caruana’s dubious 25. f4 sent the computers haywire. The challenger’s position appeared increasingly difficult to hold after 26. ... e4 27. Be2 Be8 28. Kb1 Bf6 29. Re1 a4 30. Qb4 g6.Which made Carlsen’s decision to offer a draw after 31. Rd1 Ra8 nothing short of mystifying. A relieved Caruana gladly accepted after a game that had lasted two hours and 57 minutes, sending the match to Wednesday’s tie-breaker.He added: “I’m mainly relieved because I thought it was quite close today. I was very worried during the game. When you feel like you’re sort of on the brink of defeat, or at least you have a very dangerous position, then of course it’s quite good.”Both players bristled at the notion that a world title match consisting solely of draws could undercut the sport’s popularity, addressing the central talking point of their three-week psychodrama.“We work with the match that we have,” Caruana said. “If the powers that be want to change it, then we’ll work with something else.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3141a4f8615bb91446e608b34d87358386e6c03/0_208_4483_2690/master/4483.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8befc9e1ca7d6b9f06c30af2d508de28","title":"f1 broadcasting paywall tv","story":"While Lewis Hamilton performed his doughnuts in front of the grandstand and then removed his fireproof vest in order to display his tattoos on the podium in Abu Dhabi on Sunday night, Channel 4’s lineup of commentators, presenters and analysts were packing their bags, having broadcast the race to an average audience of 2.3 million, as live grand prix coverage in Britain prepared to disappear behind a paywall.The deal to grant Sky exclusive rights, for a fee of around £1.2bn over five years, was made by Bernie Ecclestone. In many ways Formula One is better off without a ringmaster who clung to power as tenaciously as Gordon Taylor is doing. Had Ecclestone still been in charge, however, he might now have been looking for a way to preserve the bigger audience that sponsors and advertisers always want. But that gift for manoeuvrability has gone with him.So Formula One finds itself in the position of Test cricket, the Ryder Cup, the Premier League, World Cup skiing and England’s home rugby matches – available in Britain only to those with a subscription. Now it waits to find out whether it will prosper, as the Premier League has undoubtedly done, or suffer in the manner of Test cricket, which retains a following but has lost a certain position in the national life.For those with access to Sky, the satellite channel will no doubt continue to bring unprecedented resources to bear on the sport. There are aspects that stretch the patience, like the rushed and inane encounters of the grid walk and the plethora of pensioned-off drivers saying nothing very much. Sometimes it makes one yearn for the distinctive BBC commentary of Raymond Baxter or Murray Walker, who were enthusiasts before they became broadcasters, the bullshit-free observations of James Hunt, or even the ruminations of John Bolster, with his deerstalker hat and “roving microphone”, who could peer at the innards of a Connaught or a Maserati and know exactly what he was looking at, since he had built and raced his own cars in the 1930s.But then you see the level of detailed technical analysis provided by Anthony Davidson, whose career as a participant in the sport – like that of Simon Hughes in cricket – stopped just short of the very highest level of achievement. Or the post-race debrief provided by Ted Kravitz, who wanders through the paddock as the teams pack up, consulting his notebook to provide a concise, colourful and perceptive summary of each team’s performance that day, from the front of the grid to the back. I don’t suppose Kravitz has ever built a racing car with his bare hands, but in every other way he is the John Bolster of the 21st century.Nevertheless, Liberty Media, which bought Formula One’s commercial rights from a private equity company and promptly showed Ecclestone the door, is inheriting the probability of a further drop in audience ratings, following a sharp downward trend that began when Sky entered the picture and the free-to-air window started to close. For the owners, as for Ecclestone, the upside is the guaranteed income.Liberty Media’s strategy varies from country to country – in Germany, for instance, pay-TV has been abandoned in favour of a lucrative arrangement with a terrestrial network – but its long-term plan appears to be the provision of coverage via its own streaming service. Although this is not yet possible in those territories, such as Britain, where there is an existing deal with a broadcaster, it plans to start it up next season in the Netherlands, where a huge following makes Max Verstappen a key future box-office attraction. It remains to be seen whether the chance to switch between live onboard cameras and team radio from all 20 cars will prove attractive enough to compensate for the final erosion of any kind of editorial independence.Going for immediate revenue above all other considerations risks damaging the already shaky ecology of Formula One. The announcement of a new race in Hanoi fits in with the old regime’s policy of taking vast amounts of cash from places that want F1’s prestige without having a base of support, but the policy also threatens to stretch, in both financial and human terms, the ability of the teams to cope with an already overcrowded calendar.Meanwhile, F1 will have to keep an eye on Formula E, the all-electric single-seater series now about to start a fifth season with the involvement of major manufacturers who can see the future heading their way. It has a new car with increased battery power and better looks, a schedule of races in photogenic cities from Marrakesh to Berlin, and now a deal with the BBC for free-to-air live transmission via the red button, plus one live race on BBC2.Given recent events, the choice of Ad Diriyah in Saudi Arabia might not be ideal for the opening round on 15 December. But at a time when so much sport is competing for attention, there’s something to be said for free access to a series that genuinely wants to increase its audience rather than just pocket vast amounts of dosh."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d18dc62592f65b01622fe465e619d487b40babcc/0_286_4758_2855/master/4758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90dd9807dac9450357195d2e60986b4f","title":"magnus carlsen v fabiano caruana world chess championship game 12 live","story":"Here’s Bryan’s report off today’s game, which you can replay below. Be sure to join us on Wednesday for minute-by-minute coverage of the tie-breaker.Garry Kasparov has spoken. The longtime world No 1 believes Carlsen’s decision to offer a draw may undercut his status as favorite in Wednesday’s tie-breaker. “I wasn’t necessarily going for the maximum,” says Carlsen, essentially admitting that he was content with a draw after move 20. “I just wanted a position that was completely safe, (but) where I could put some pressure. If a draw hadn’t been a satisfactory result, obviously I would have approached it differently.”Says Caruana: “I was a bit surprised by the draw offer. I can never be better (than move 31). And I don’t really have any active ideas. If anything, black is better. At least I thought I was over the worst of it. I thought it was much more dangerous a few moves ago.”Carlsen will play with the white pieces in the first game of Wednesday’s rapid play-off after the drawing of lots is conducted. Here’s a look at the format: • Best of four rapid games with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move.  • If still tied, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment). • If all five mini-matches are drawn, one sudden-death ‘Armegeddon’ match will be played where White receives five minutes and Black receives four minutes. Both players will receive a three-second increment after the 60th move. In the case of a draw, Black will be declared the winner.Carlsen offers a draw after 30. ... g6 31. Rd1 Ra8 and Caruana accepts. Wow! An absolute shocker given Carlsen’s position and advantage on time! It’s a peaceful result after 31 moves and three hours and the world championship will be settled Wednesday in a tie-breaker.Caruana plays 30. Qb4 and he’s working with 15min 42sec after the increment. He’ll need to make his next 10 moves in that  to reach move 40, after which the players are given an additional 50 minutes. But it won’t be a walk in the park as he weathers a Carlsen attack where one false step could torpedo the whole enterprise. Caruana plays 29. Re1 in an apparent move to improve the position of the knight on f2. As we wait for Carlsen’s reponse, reader Abhijato Sensarma checks in via email with his take on Caruana’s 25. f4:Well, I for one am never going to trust the supercomputer about a position’s advantage until it becomes very significant. The move is a reasonable one once you understand the purpose behind it, if not the technically perfect one, which might turn out to be the decisive reason why today’s finale is not a draw! I am secretly rooting for Caruana so that the next Championship can have personal undertones since Carlsen will undoubtedly be the Challenger then. Whatever happens, happens today. If Carslen wins (he does have an advantage, and known for creating something out of nothing), Caruana won’t mind since he would have lost in the tie break in all likeliness. He can come back stronger. This match might be the thriller which will inject urgency into the stagnant chess world once more!If it is over today, I will have to relay a funny experience I had the other day. I looked at the my fellow classmates during a friendly football match. We were level at five all. “It looks drawish!” I said and my other chess-knowing friend started laughing, and the others were left dumbfounded. With any luck, maybe we’ll get the sixth goal in today!Carlsen attacks white’s queen with 25. ... a5 and Caruana retreats (26. Qd2). Black still better after 26. ... e4 27. Be2 Be8 28. Kb1 Bf6. As time pressure mounts on Caruana, the position could be difficult to hold.Carlsen has twice as much time as Caruana after 24 moves. He will need to make 16 moves in the next half hour before the time control. Surely Carlsen has the initiative after 22. ... Bg6 23. Rc2 f5. Dynamic game, this. Everything that observers underwhelmed by the record streak of draws could have hoped for. Carlsen responds with 21. ... Rac8 after a little more than 10 minutes. Black is ahead in development with more than a half-hour advantage in time. Caruana finds himself up against it here with no obvious plan. And after eight minutes the American castles on the queenside (22. O-O-O). The tension, the complications, the tactical potential ... it’s all coming to a head. “This is exciting,” Aronian says of Caruana’s choice. “This is something I didn’t expect at all.”Carlsen castles after a 12-minute think (20. ... O-O) and Caruana counters with a surprise move (21. Rh2!?). “An amazing move by Fabiano,” Russian chess grandmaster Alexander Grischuk says. “The deepest move in the match so far!” The Norwegian supercomputer Sesse, running Stockfish, is less bullish, indicating Caruana’s steadily held advantage is lost and black is better.“The position doesn’t look anything like a draw, which makes me very, very happy,” says world No 11 Levon Aronian. Carlsen has been on the clock for about 10 minutes, but he remains comfortably ahead on time. Carlsen continues to enjoy a widening time advantage after 19. Ne4 Nd7 20. Bd3. Carlsen spends about six minutes weighing his 20th move before removing his jacket. He’s still on the clock. Says grandmaster Anish Giri: “White’s position is rather soft for the last game of a world championship, don’t you think?” Garry Kasparov says he believes the current position will yield a decisive result.Caruana expends another five minutes before playing 18. f3. Says grandmaster grandmaster Judit Polgar in the commentary booth: “It’s very strange because we have special, unique things happening when Fabiano is pushing his pawns.” Carlsen takes just over a minute before answering with 18. ... Nf8.After 25 minutes Caruana finally plays 17. g3. Carlsen immediately responds with 17. ... Be7.Caruana has been thinking for more than 20 minutes after Carlsen played 16. Qc7.

Carlsen comes back with 15. ... a6 and Caruana answers with 16. Nc3. The American is 20 minutes behind on the clock already. Could a draw by repetition be forthcoming? It’s a possibility after 13.

Nc3 e5, we’re into the Sveshnikov variation, same as the eighth game!Hello and welcome to London for today’s 12th game of the world chess championship between Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana. Play resumes today at the College in Holborn after with the best-of-12-games match deadlocked at 5½-all following 11 draws in as many contests. Sixteen days and no blood drawn: the longest streak of games to open a match without a decisive result in the recognized 132-year history of world championship play. But the tension will never be higher than today, where a decisive result would lift the winner over the 6½-point threshold and determine an outright winner in the €1m ($1.14m) showdown.Carlsen, 27, has been ranked No 1 for eight straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he defeated Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Caruana, 26, is ranked No 2, having earned his place at the table by winning the candidates tournament in March. No American-born player has won or even competed for the world title since Bobby Fischer in 1972.\u0026nbspIt marks the first title match between the world\u0027s top two players since 1990, when Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov faced off for a fifth and final time.\u0026nbspThe match will consist of 12 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches six and a half points first will be declared the champion.The time control for each game is 100 minutes for the first 40 moves, 50 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 1. Players cannot agree to a draw before Black\u0027s 30th move.\u0026nbspIf the match is tied after 12 games, tie-breaks will be played on the final day in the following order:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• Best of four rapid games with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• If still tied, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment).\u0026nbsp• If all five mini-matches are drawn, one sudden-death \u0027Armegeddon\u0027 match will be played where White receives five minutes and Black receives four minutes. Both players will receive a three-second increment after the 60th move. In the case of a draw, Black will be declared the winner.Thu 8 Nov – Opening ceremony Fri 9 Nov – Game 1\u0026nbspSat 10 Nov – Game 2 Sun 11 Nov – Rest day Mon 12 Nov – Game 3 Tue 13 Nov – Game 4 Wed 14 Nov – Rest day Thu 15 Nov – Game 5 Fri 16 Nov – Game 6 Sat 17 Nov – Rest day Sun 18 Nov – Game 7 Mon 19 Nov –\u0026nbspGame 8 Tue 20 Nov –\u0026nbspRest day Wed 21 Nov – Game 9 Thu 22 Nov –\u0026nbspGame 10 Fri 23 Nov –\u0026nbspRest day Sat 24 Nov – Game 11 Sun 25 Nov – Rest day Mon 26 Nov – Game 12 Tue 27 Nov – Rest day Wed 28 Nov – Tie-break gamesAwards and closingThe games commence each day at 3pm in London.If Carlsen can pull off a win with the black pieces, the 27-year-old from Norway will seal his third defense of the title he captured from Viswanathan Anand in 2013.If Caruana can win as white, the 26-year-old challenger will not only become the second American-born player to capture the world championship after Bobby Fischer in 1972, he will inherit the No 1 ranking that Carlsen has held uninterrupted since July 2011.If they draw for a 12th time, it will all come down to Wednesday’s tie-breaker, which consists of a series of games under shorter time controls. A brief recap on how we got here: Game 1 was a grueling seven-hour, 115-move staredown, where Carlsen nearly become the first defending champion to win the opening game of a world championship as black in 37 years. The next four contests – Game 2, Game 3, Game 4 and Game 5 – were mostly safer, straightforward affairs that allowed Caruana to get his teeth in the match. The tension ramped up in Game 6 when Carlsen was outplayed by Caruana in the middlegame and pushed to the limit before saving a draw with incredibly precise defending. They played to another draw in Game 7, a result that left the champion lamenting his gun-shy play as white. In Game 8, Carlsen found himself down nearly an hour on the clock facing a dangerous position as black, until one false step by the American allowed him to hold. It was Caruana’s turn to suffer in Wednesday’s Game 9 until he was bailed out by a Carlsen inaccuracy. Then came Thursday’s Game 10, where Caruana found himself on the brink once more until Carlsen overextended himself and was made to grovel for a peaceful result. Saturday’s Game 11 fizzled out practically before liftoff, ending in a simple two-and-a-quarter-hour draw.Eleven games. Eleven draws. Will the staredown finally end today? We’ll soon find out when Caruana makes the first move at the top of the hour.Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here’s his report from Saturday’s Game 11.Carlsen, as white, played into Caruana’s Petroff with an opening line that paralleled their August meeting at the Sinquefield Cup, which ended in a draw. The American challenger and world No 2 was first to deviate, castling on the kingside (7. O-O) instead of the Nc6 he’d played in St Louis.A briefly promising double-edge position took shape with (8. Qd2 Nd7 9. O-O-O Nf6 10. Bd3 c5), but Carlsen expended 23 minutes on his next two moves (11. Rhe1 Be6 12. Kb1 Qa5) and admitted he’d been thrown for a curve once more by Caruana’s exhaustively researched opening preparation and not for the first time during the fortnight. Eventually the champion offered up a queen exchange with 13. c4 and the ladies were off the board (13. ... Qxd2 14. Bxd2), abruptly stripping the tension from the affair.“I wasn’t pleased from the opening and then after that I just wanted to play it safe,” Carlsen said. “I was trying to push a little bit, but it’s nothing real. In this match situation I thought there was no reason to go crazy.”The action soon entered an opposite-colored bishop endgame which Caruana held with no problems before consenting to a 55-move draw after two hours and 13 minutes, the shortest game of the match so far."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/453dabd10daacf0333010af69c833b35d099f462/0_145_4457_2674/master/4457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d507af4e26c786da94b8bee2184e7d1","title":"darbar festival review akram khan sadlers wells london","story":"Sadler’s Wells, LondonCurated by Khan, this celebration of classical Indian music dips into dance forms boasting symmetry, balance and beauty Hands and faces are two sorely underused body parts in western dance, often an afterthought to acrobatic limbs. But in Indian classical dance they’re where the action is at. Epic stories unfold in the narrowing of eyes, raising of brows, the pursing or curling of lips, and the intricate arrangements of fingers.The eight Indian classical dance forms have been around for a couple of thousand years, way longer than ballet, but it’s rare to see them on a major stage in pure form, rather than contemporary fusion. Akram Khan (one proponent of such fusion) has curated this event, exploring three dance forms, bharatanatyam, kathak and odissi, part of the Darbar festival of classical Indian music.For the uninitiated, classical art forms can feel impenetrable, but they share a sense of symmetry, proportion, balance and beauty that seems to be universal across cultures. Certainly bharatanatyam, originating in Tamil Nadu, is a dance of clarity. Its wide open angles snap between poses so swiftly you barely see the limbs travel. In the storytelling, there is a specificity to the gestures (mudras) even if you don’t know their inidual meanings. And then there is the musicality: steps matching the music’s rhythms, steadily at first, accelerating into complexity, with additive rhythms that feel like a movie chase scene, the sense that you’re almost home thwarted by another corner turned and a swell of heady anticipation.A new piece by choreographer Mavin Khoo is performed by two young dancers trained in Chennai, Neha Mondal Chakravarty and Renjith Babu: she, sharp to the rhythms and subtle of facial expression he, warm, innocently impish, and very good at headstands. Babu, as Shiva, remains poised in upside-down contemplation, while Chakravarty kicks up the sand border separating the stage from the musicians, playing out the destructive force of goddess Kali. Chakravarty swells with strength then suddenly shrinks with fear, as the pair appear to be locked in a battle with themselves and each other.It’s all framed by an arresting lighting installation, hundreds of bulbs hanging in a radiant ceiling that shape-shifts for each piece across both evenings of the festival. It glows over dancer Sujata Mohapatra in a piece of odissi dance, passed down from her guru, theatrically telling the story of Sita, Rama and a 10-headed demon. Mohapatra looks a like a temple carving of a goddess come to life, elaborately costumed in blue, red, gold and pearl, she floats above the pounding beats and thick string tones of the music, an utterly beguiling presence. Her face flits from coy to knowing, to blithe and beatific but it’s with her hands she casts her spell – there’s something magic going on there. Imagine a voice with rich, honeyed tones and transfer that to the expression of wrists and digits.By contrast, kathak performer Gauri Diwakar is a more naturalistic, human presence. Kathak is an earthier, more virtuosic form, and choreographer Aditi Mangaldas plays with its velocity in sudden stops and suspensions. It’s also a dance form that truly embodies music, Diwakar’s feet stamping to the tabla and pakhawaj drum, while her arms and gently jutting chin play a melody.Darbar offers only a small dip into the vast history, and present, of classical Indian dance, but it’s great to see some of the breadth and quality of that art form centre stage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/046bf54bc1caeb503f1c6f90bc08ba7568d9edbe/195_298_4616_2771/master/4616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee6778f97b0ad596f42fd00a763a5ba5","title":"huddle review unicorn theatre london penguins under sixes","story":"Unicorn, LondonFilskit Theatre’s winter warmer for under-sixes is a cracking tale of parenting penguin-styleMy five-year-old daughter Hilda loves penguins, principally Pingu and Peso, the dedicated medic on Octonauts. She’s excited to see this show about a daddy penguin and his chick I’m intrigued, too, because we both loved Filskit Theatre’s last winter warmer, Breaking the Ice.However, en route to the Unicorn I discover that a) Hilda is expecting real penguins and b) she has no memories of that show from 2015. But the kids all dressed up as polar bears and huskies, I say, and you invaded the stage and hopped along icebergs! She looks back at me blankly.The lack of genuine flightless birds in Huddle is quickly forgotten as Joseph Barnes-Phillips struts out in a costume that’s part dungaree and part flippery wetsuit. He’s perfected his penguin cry – a squawk which the kids soon imitate – and his flappity antics are neatly matched by ragtime jazz. This mischievous penguin is more Pingu than Peso, but he discovers a new sense of responsibility after a large egg is delivered to him in a crate that floats down from above. Suspense builds in the audience as the lid opens to let out a mysterious glow – I can’t watch this without thinking of Repo Man – and Hilda is in hysterics when the egg is recklessly thrown around the stage.And what a stage. Filskit specialise in combining projections with live action, and a colony of penguins can be seen gently waddling on a screen throughout the show. An affecting animated prologue gives daddy penguin a bit of backstory, but it’s too subtle for Hilda to comprehend (and she’s at the top of the two-to-five age range for the show). Still, Hilda loves the set and costumes by Maxwell Nicholson-Lailey: a washing line holds a row of paper fishes that the penguins guzzle, and both the handsome sleigh and the icy slide look enticing for the young audience.Soon, the egg has hatched and daddy penguin has his flippers full. As the newly hatched chick, Victoria Dyson wears an eggshell hat and a downy grey costume that cleverly sheds sections as she grows up, revealing a penguin suit beneath. Dyson goes from wide-eyed wonder at her new surroundings to helplessness when the chick gets hungry. Barnes-Phillips veers between finding his little one adorable and exasperating this isn’t played purely for laughs and all parents will recognise his bleary behaviour.Hilda is beaming as the penguin teaches his chick to walk in a little duet and when the two play hide and seek. There’s what the BBFC might deem “mild peril” as projections of gulls circle above the chick. There are also episodes about discovering independence, growing in confidence and caring for each other in an icy climate, often backed – appropriately enough – by chillout music.“There were a few sad bits weren’t there?” Hilda says at the end. “I felt sorry for the little penguin.” But it’s the jazzy penguin pranks that I think she’ll remember, and she isn’t the only kid squawking on her way out of the theatre.• Huddle is at the Unicorn theatre, London, until 6 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/411747fc874e04aaf7a06d8b0966f9a6678c2cb1/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98bead8cea036f38fd0251abda273640","title":"first impressions exes and smooth exits master the art of conversation","story":"There’s no avoiding it, the season filled with cheer is also filled with chat – conversations you don’t want to have and ones you want to shine in. From how to tell a joke to how to handle an ex, experts advise A funny thing happens at the beginning of December. Suddenly, as the year comes to a close, you find yourself unable to say no to mulled wine, even if a hot, sickly-sweet punch is antithetical to your idea of good drinking colleagues regarded as the most dogged homebodies now seem to be joining you at the pub then the whole thing is brought to a close by spending the day with a group of people, most often related to you, many of whom you haven’t seen for a year, and will most likely not see again for another year.What all of this means is that if there’s one thing you’d better be ready for come Christmastime, it’s to socialise – to chat your way through dinner parties, drinks receptions, office get-togethers and pubs. Which is why we’ve solicited the advice of relationship columnist Justin Myers, AKA the Guyliner, linguist and communication expert Malgorzata Chalupnik, and drinks writer Nina Caplan to cover a few of the conundrums you’re likely to come up against this silly season, starting with …How to make a good first impression“One of the biggest letdowns when meeting someone for the first time is their evident lack of interest,” says Myers. “When someone asks you something, what they really want to do is tell you what they think. All it takes is ‘and you?’ once you’ve given your answer, and you’re already way ahead of most people,” he says.Chalupnik adds the key isn’t just paying attention, but outwardly conveying the fact that you are paying attention – what she describes as “active listenership”.“We constantly reveal more about ourselves to others through how we say things, our body language, our facial expressions and gestures. Making a good impression is not just about what we say, it can also revolve around the idea of how we show that we pay attention to other people,” she says.“Active listenership itself is all about showing that we listen to other people. The way to best signal it is through eye contact, orientating our body towards the speaker and nodding to show that we’re engaged.”And how do we know if it’s worked?“The theory of communication accommodation argues that if we like someone, we’re more likely to speak or act like them,” Chalupnik says. “If you notice that the person you are talking to starts sounding a bit more like you, for example, you are on the right track.”How to make small talkYou may not like it, but the need to make small talk is one of life’s unavoidable realities – and for good reason, according to Chalupnik. “Small talk establishes and maintains harmonious social relations,” she says.But this fact doesn’t make it any less challenging. “Small talk is terrifying only because we’re scared of boring each other to death,” says Myers. “How small should the talk stay? Weather? No, please, no. Vague humble bragging about your job or loft conversion? It’s a tough one.” His advice is that winning at the small talk game is all about keeping things “light, topical and totally devoid of political posturing – it can never end well”.“Box sets, fitness regimes, favourite restaurants and books are a popular way of revealing aspects of your personality without outing yourself as too much of a nightmare,” he says. “Sport, too, if you can bear the armchair punditry.”If you still find the idea of small talk stomach-churning, it’s worth remembering that you don’t have to do all the work – listening and accommodating others is just as important, says Chalupnik. “As with making a good first impression, the key is to provide all speakers the chance to engage,” she says.How to tell an anecdote or joke We’ve all been there: that moment when your great punchline is met with stony silence. It’s not a pleasant feeling, and it’s something that, once burned, we wouldn’t look to repeat. The good news is that there are strategies to avoid this, says Myers.“Read the room first. There’s nothing worse than launching into your best gag only to see horror creep across the faces of your audience,” he says. “It’s best to wait for a gap in conversation, too. Nobody likes being yanked out of a deep conversation only to be told a joke of Christmas cracker calibre.”Chalupnik concurs: “Know your audience. Know your context,” she says. “Humour, despite being a very useful and multi-faceted device, can also backfire.” She advises sticking to self-denigrating, anecdotal humour and avoiding sarcasm, which can be easily misread.“Sarcasm can carry a potentially aggressive meaning, so its interpretation can vary depending on the person we speak to,” she says. “Before using sarcasm, make sure that you are certain that they don’t mind it.”In much the same way, Myers believes that telling an anecdote well requires a good dose of self-awareness and respect for the time of the person to whom you are talking. “Have faith in the anecdote,” he says. “Tell it confidently and as quickly as possible without losing your listeners or missing parts out. And never, ever preface an anecdote or joke with: ‘Listen to this, it’s brilliant’ – the only way from there is down.”How to talk about alcohol like a proFrom knowing how to comment on a wine you’ve been sharing, to knowing when to avoid telling a debauched drinking tale, there is absolutely a right and a wrong way to talk about alcohol, according to food journalist Caplan.“Gauge your audience,” she says. “There’s no point telling stories about drunkenness to a clutch of wine professionals, and there’s equally little to gain in wittering on about grape varieties and soil types to twentysomethings in the pub.”Myers offers a similar view on those stories detailing some prodigious feat of alcoholic intake, which is that they are to be avoided entirely. “Never, ever mention how many drinks it takes to make you fall over,” he says. “Drunk stories are not badges of honour any more.”But it is possible to talk about alcohol with both dignity and tact, says Caplan, particularly when it comes to wine and grape-distilled spirits. “There are a few basic flavour profiles you can learn,” she says. “So, new world rieslings are quite often tropical in flavour, syrahs are spicy and peppery. Cognacs tend to have nutty andor fruity notes.”If you’re after a quick way to sound like you know what you’re talking about, Caplan suggests you start by dropping these keywords: bouquet (“this basically translates to: ‘what the wine smells like’ – but a much prettier word”), blend (“if there is more than one kind of grape in the wine, it’s a blend”) and tannin (“if the wine has a chewy, slightly drying sensation in the mouth, tannins – compounds found in the grape – are responsible”).“Just remember that they are your tastebuds,” says Caplan. “So, even if what you smell or taste is entirely different from what the books or your companions tell you, nobody can tell you that you’re wrong.”Alternatively, stay away from precise descriptions altogether, and wow ‘em with some fun boozy titbits instead: “For instance,” Caplan says, “the oldest and finest cognacs are aged in a special cellar, accessible only to the cellar master. This cellar within a cellar is so-named because the portion of the liquid in the barrel that evaporates as it ages is known as the angels’ share.” Baptiste Loiseau, the cellar master for Rémy Martin, says that their angels’ share equates to as much as 8,000 bottles a day (he also says you should serve their Rémy Martin 1738 with frozen grapes instead of ice cubes, so it doesn’t get diluted – serve that as you drop the angels’ share bomb for serious pro points).Pick up a bottle hereHow to speak to someone you kissed under the mistletoe last ChristmasIn a month defined by a) large gatherings and b) large measures, its not unthinkable that you might bump into a ghost of Christmas’ past – whether a one-time, under the mistletoe thing or a full-on ex – so you need to learn how to handle it like an adult.“‘I didn’t recognise you with your clothes on’ is an opener best avoided,” says Myers. “Chatting to people we’ve kissed is only awkward because we insist on acting like teenagers around one another,” says Myers.“If you haven’t been in touch since,” he says, “you may have to wheel out an apology. ‘I’ve been so busy, I’m rubbish at keeping in touch’, is the excuse they expect, so don’t let them down.”Otherwise, he advises “not to mention the kiss”, but do your best to “be charming and, most of all to not expect a repeat performance”.And when it comes to an unexpected encounter with an ex? “As is the case with any conversation, being civil is a good idea,” says Chalupnik. “If there is any conflict there, your aim should be to gradually moderate your position and de-escalate the verbal conflict.” In other words, play nice.And finally, how to make a polite exitWhether you’re just pulling out of a conversation, or leaving a party outright, knowing how to make a polite exit is an underrated and poorly understood social skill, says Myers.“Once a conversation has run its course, it can still be tricky to bring it to an official end,” he says. “Even awkward silences and the dreaded ‘well …’ leave some undaunted. The best way to get out of a conversation is to start another one.”“It’s like a relay,” he says. “Either offer to go get them a drink and then bring someone else back with you to freshen things up, or say you’d like to introduce them to someone, and take them to join this new group. Then, once they’re chatting, make your departure. And if they do come to find you, have a spare drink at hand just in case, give it to them, exclaim ‘There you are!’ and await your Oscar nomination for best reaction.”Of course, making an exit – especially at this time of year – can be as much about knowing your limits as anything else. “Learning when to say ‘stop’ is part of becoming an adult,” says Caplan. “You have to ask yourself: ‘is this actually fun?’ And if the answer is ‘no’, you’ve probably surpassed your limits.”For more smart conversation starters, La Maison Rémy Martin members’ club offers cultural events, masterclasses and experiences from the leading names in food and drink, art and design, fashion, film and more from their residency at London’s Bibendum.

From Christmas cocktail parties to sit-down dinners, here’s how to host with impact and ease this seasonThe nights have drawn in, George and Mariah are in a state of perpetual soundclash, and with them comes the unsettling urge to host a seasonal get-together.If you’re an unsteady host, even an intimate dinner with a handful of friends can seem daunting, so when you chuck in the plus-ones, her next door and a cluster of colleagues, that “fun and festive” party can start to feel anything but.But things don’t need to get all out of control and Abigail’s Party. We live in a time when fine dining and Michelin-starred chefs appear in the most casual of settings, and that informality extends to the at-home-host, too. Claude Bosi - head chef of Bibendum restaurant and Rémy Martin cognac bar – is one such Michelin-starred chef who advocates this relaxed approach when entertaining.“The key to a great party,” he says, “is to ensure you are with your guests. There are so many dinner parties where you try to impress and find yourself spending more time in the kitchen than you spend with your guests. A great party is a balance between good food and good hospitality.”Here’s how it’s done:The dinner partyThis casual mantra starts at the top – the formalities of the past have been dispensed with. Invites can go out on WhatsApp or email. Similarly, boy-girl seating plans at dinner are a relic of another time. Remember, too, if there are only two single guests at a dinner party, they don’t necessarily want to be seated together, lest they feel like show ponies being watched over by the other guests for signs of good chemistry. And unless you have a particular gift for crafting, there’s no need for place names.That said, some small details done nicely can make a real difference. Take your dinner table, for example, as chef and caterer Stephanie Boote says: “I like a simple table, not too much fuss. A linen cloth can be lovely, napkins, if you have them. A couple of little vases or bottles with flowers or foliage. Candlelight is a must. You can have a pile of plates and cutlery on top of an undressed table, a water jug and a stack of glasses, and if you have candles lit it will all be just fine!”There are lots of ways to make life easier as you prep your dinner-party meal, especially as your guests arrive and the heat rises in the kitchen. For Bosi, a neat trick is to go for a cold starter. He suggests getting a terrine from a local deli and serving it with a salad, all handily ready to go on plates ahead of time.Food writer and author Killian Fox offers similar logic when feeding a crowd. “Simplify,” he says. “Instead of a starter, lay out a range of snacks – decent crisps and dips, olives, maybe some crostini – for people to eat when they come through the door. Use the time you’ve saved to make sure everyone has enough booze.”Drinks are, of course, key to a great dinner party. Leave time at the beginning for an aperitif, which will give you more breathing room to prepare your food, take account of inevitable late arrivals (“our Uber kept cancelling”) and let appetites build.Fox suggests a handy seasonal cocktail, too, named London Calling. “It was apparently devised at Milk \u0026amp Honey in Soho. It’s citrussy, it contains sherry, and it gives you a chance to look classy with a cocktail shaker. A fine Christmas drink.”Bosi suggests a drink can offer some surprises and lead to unexpected food pairings. He likes a Royal Sidecar, made with Rémy Martin 1738 Accord Royal cognac, Cointreau and lemon – and paired with oysters.“Until recently, cognac was something you would have after a great lunch,” he says. “It’s not something you’re expecting to drink at the start of the meal, but I find it goes very well with seafood. It’s a nice surprise, a bit of creativity. At that moment, you’ve made people really relaxed and given your meal a stamp of quality.”From then on, you can go with some classic dishes: a big joint of meat, a casserole that can be easily cooked in advance, a beautiful stew with game, or Bosi’s festive favourite: beef wellington.When it comes to serving, Bosi tends to stick to sharing plates. “I put pots in the middle of the table and we start sharing,” he says. “I think dinner parties with people closer to each other are a better atmosphere.”Boote adds a word of practical advice: “Preparation is key. Your guests are here to see you, not have you run about trying to do things. Keep it simple, with excellent ingredients that speak for themselves.”Dinner party music has long been something of a slur, a byword for a pleasant but bland background soundtrack. But you don’t want to be sitting in silence accompanied only by the sound of mastication and scraping forks, so head to Spotify to put together some playlists.For dinner, you want something that is eclectic but not too distracting – you don’t want to be continually flicking to the next song. However, you also don’t want to drift into nondescript tastefulness, either.The drinks partyInteresting people, nice snacks, some decent tunes and plenty of booze is all that’s needed for a drinks party. Keep things loose – this means submitting to the inevitable and assuming a crowd will congregate in your kitchen. Be ready to push some seats away in the living room if a late dance party emerges.When it comes to the drinks, try to be creative, says Boote: “This year, we have made a fig leaf syrup to go with lime juice, gin and soda. It’s delicious without the gin, too.” She follows that adding clementine flavours and fizz to spirits makes any drink feel “festive and delicious”.Of course, guests will be looking for something to nibble on, so lay out some decent crisps, popcorn or olives.You can also add some more expansive finger food into the mix. Boote goes for gougères, a French choux pastry filled with cheese, while Bosi will be serving up some intriguing offerings: Rémy Martin cognac, mixed with tonic (a Rémy Grand Tonic – the French spin on the British classic), served with his “pickled cockle popcorn”. The cockles are rolled in flour then deep-fried in hot oil, coming out as if popcorn. “It’s a fantastic pairing,” he says. To give it a seasonal twist, add some clove or orange to the cognac.Fox offers a snack serving with a backstory: “The Gilda – a pintxo created in honour of Rita Hayworth, who starred in the film Gilda. It’s pretty easy: skewer a couple of green olives on a toothpick with guindilla peppers and an anchovy fillet.”You want to keep the music equally eclectic but a little more upbeat. However, don’t feel the need to overload it with bangers and floor fillers. If the party goes late, you can bring out the hits. Remember to let a few people try out their music selections – it’s never fun to be overprotective of the music at a party, nor do you want one person hogging the speaker. Finally, if things take a particularly boozy turn, fire up some karaoke through YouTube.And finally …Really, there’s no set formula. Follow your instincts, embrace comfort and concentrate on having fun. And, if in doubt, remember some salient words from Bosi:“Just don’t try too hard. Don’t try to impress is the wrong thing to say – you want to impress – but stay in your comfort zone. Stay comfortable, enjoy yourself, keep it simple – and have a good time.”Make like Bosi and kick off that good time with a Royal Sidecar or Rémy Grand Tonic of your own – buy a bottle here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d16f1baa42848086581eec715d14587ea317697/0_0_2853_1712/master/2853.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47969a859d56d75d5d9857be65d4bda3","title":"the 12 saves of christmas an expert survival guide","story":"From emergency gift ideas to master mixology – via Jackson Boxer’s ballotine and Patrick Grant’s suit – experts share their must-haves and must-dos for surviving the festive season 1.

If in doubt, I now reach for Home Alone – guaranteed laughs for all ages – or White Christmas, which has that reassuring retro glow.”Smith has hosted private film events as part of the La Maison Rémy Martin members’ club2. Tim Halilaj, award-winning mixologist“People always run out of ice at Christmas parties, so the night before just fill your freezer with plastic containers of water and then hack these bergs into rugged lumps – they’re more on-trend than cubes. For totally clear ice, boil tap water, let it cool and then freeze it.”3. Shona Vertue, personal trainer (and David Beckham’s yoga teacher)“The gym seems like a distant memory over Christmas, but it doesn’t have to be that way. Type ‘HIIT’ into YouTube and do a 30-minute home workout, using nothing but your body weight to induce sweat and burn Christmas dinner calories. If nothing else, it gives you a break from the family for half an hour!”4. Garrett Moore, party planner and co-founder of Immersive Cult“Go for candlelight, scattered lamps and dim light. Some people feel self-conscious at parties and they don’t want to feel like they’re being watched, so low lighting is very conducive to good times. And create welcoming spaces where people can sit somewhere quiet and have a nice conversation if they want to. Maybe have a mistletoe area or create a little grotto-type nook. It’s nice for guests to feel like they have options and places to explore.”“I also have a bottle of Rémy Martin. I serve it with pickled cockle popcorn – it’s a fantastic pairing – with clove or orange added to the cognac to give it a seasonal twist.”Try Bosi’s cognac and pickled cockle pairing (and other seasonal cognac cocktails and food pairings) at Rémy Martin residency at Claude Bosi at Bibendum6.

And if they’re not claimed, that’s even better, as you can just enjoy them yourself.”7. Wrapologist Kirsten Westlake, from gift-wrapping service Wrapsody“Double-sided Sellotape is my secret weapon. It’s invisible and makes the finished product appear super slick. Most people come unstuck by using too much paper, which causes bulky, messy folds. The secret is to measure before you cut and use just enough paper to meet by about a centimetre.”8. Candice Brathwaite, parenting blogger“One tried-and-tested Christmas save if you’ve got a house full of children is advent stockings. I put them up on 1 December – containing 24 tiny, totally inexpensive gifts. The most important thing is that they aren’t allowed to open their advent presents until the end of the day, so it’s the perfect bribe to try and keep them in order until the evening.”9. Patrick Grant, fashion designer“If you’re having a suit tailored, have them cut you an evening suit with both a dress vest and a cummerbund. By this simple expedient, you can wear the same suit throughout the Christmas party season. Just switch between the two, change up your pocket hanky and, hey presto, with one suit you will look subtly different but always impeccable.”Grant has hosted private fashion events as part of the La Maison Rémy Martin members’ club10. Florist Anna Potter, from Swallows and Damsons“Bowls of one kind of fruit such as apples, figs, pomegranates or pears on a table make great centrepieces. Any fruit or vegetable that has an interesting shape, colour or texture looks amazing and harks back to Christmas being about feasting. And a sprig of rosemary looks beautiful on a place setting and also smells great. Or sneak some foliage from the garden and wrap it into a leafy circle to make a mini wreath for each guest.”11. Jackson Boxer, chef and restaurateur, St Leonards and Brunswick House“I make up a large ballotine of cured foie gras loaded with black truffles and brandy. It’s good to have on hand to quell appetites if anything goes wrong and causes any delays, or anyone shows up unexpectedly. And it’s outrageously delicious smeared on top of butter-fried cold Christmas pudding – a sentiment heartily endorsed by both chefs Fergus Henderson and Jeremy Lee, who know about such things.”12. Sam Lyle, co-founder of Pines and Needles“So many people order trees that are way too big for their room and have to hack bits off. The width of the tree is typically a third of the height, so be realistic about how much space you want it to take up. Trees are like flowers, they need water to stay fresh, so give your tree up to a litre of water every couple of days for the first few days, and then a litre once a week after that.”Whether you need to impress last-minute guests with some fun, festive cocktails or take Hadden-Paton’s advice and stock up on a few bottles of something smart to keep as emergency gifts, Rémy Martin could just be your ultimate seasonal save – the key ingredient to Bosi’s cocktail menu, the perfect accompaniment to pickled cockle popcorn (of course) and a rather elegant gift"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79eaf0e4e27744a752b4c467622e91e130ce5e9a/0_1028_2088_1252/master/2088.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b56b481be6b7ab55bb823547f5de100","title":"jerome corsi mueller investigation plea deal rejected","story":"Corsi said he had been offered a deal if he pleaded guilty and cooperated with Trump-Russia investigatorsA prominent rightwing conspiracy theorist with links to a longtime ally of Donald Trump claimed on Monday he had rejected a plea deal offered by the special counsel Robert Mueller.Jerome Corsi, who has connections to the Trump adviser Roger Stone, told MSNBC he had been offered a deal if he pleaded guilty and cooperated with investigators, but had resolved not to take it.The NBC producer Anna Schecter tweeted that Corsi told her he had been offered a deal on one count of perjury. According to Schecter, he said: “They want me to say I willfully lied. I’m not going to agree that I lied. I did not. I will not lie to save my life. I’d rather sit in prison and rot for as long as these thugs want me to.”The proposed deal would take Mueller’s investigation a step closer to unravelling the connections between Russian hackers who stole Democratic party emails, WikiLeaks which published thousands them, and the Trump presidential campaign, which has faced questions of collusion after apparently having advance knowledge of the leak.Corsi, 72, told the  last week: “I can confirm that we have entered plea negotiations.”Corsi is a former Washington bureau chief for the conspiracist website InfoWars and a leading proponent of the claim that Barack Obama was not born in the US and was thus not eligible to be president. Stone, 66, is a political operative and self-proclaimed “dirty trickster” who worked for Richard Nixon.During the 2016 election, Stone boasted on social media and in interviews about his knowledge that WikiLeaks was about to hit Hillary Clinton’s campaign with damaging leaks. Days before WikiLeaks started rolling out hacked emails from the Clinton campaign chief John Podesta, Stone tweeted that “it will soon be Podesta’s time in the barrel”.He has denied suggestions Corsi was his conduit for knowledge about WikiLeaks. But Corsi confirmed to the  earlier this month that his contact with the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange had been the focus of the Mueller team’s questions.“The issue they went to over and over and over again was: who was my source with Assange?” he said.According to the New York Times, prosecutors presented Corsi with evidence based on text messages and emails that he had not been truthful about his prior knowledge of the WikiLeaks dump of stolen emails.The latest twists came on a day when the Mueller investigation was moving forward on several fronts.The former Trump policy aide George  Papadopoulos arrived at a federal correctional institution in Oxford, Wisconsin to begin his two-week sentence after a judge rejected a last-minute attempt to delay his incarceration.Papadopouloswas sentenced in September for lying to the FBI in the Russia investigation. He had sought a postponement of his prison term until an appeals court rules in a separate case challenging the constitutionality of Mueller’s appointment.But in a 13-page opinion on Sunday, US district court judge Randolph Moss said Papadopoulos had waited too long to contest his sentence.Papadopoulos triggered the initial Russia investigation. Memos written by House Republicans and Democrats and now declassified show information about Papadopoulos’s contacts with Russians set in motion the FBI’s investigation in July 2016 into potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign.That investigation – kept secret by the FBI until after the election – was taken over by Mueller when the FBI director, James Comey, was fired by Trump.Mueller’s team was also due on Monday to update a judge on the status of the former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort’s cooperation with investigators.Manafort was found guilty of bank and tax fraud charges in one trial, then pleaded guilty to charges including money laundering and tax fraud related to acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government.He is due to be sentenced on 8 February, but that hinges on whether he is still working with investigators and whether they might need to call him as a witness in a new prosecution.In Washington, Trump returned from Thanksgiving to complain bitterly about the Mueller investigation and its failure to talk to “hundreds of people closely involved with my campaign who never met, saw or spoke to a Russian”.The president insisted that in his final report, Mueller should admit “all of his conflicts of interest”. He did not detail what he believes those conflicts are."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d3cf62403c171f67c5cb24859bb5bb493f5a2ca/0_15_735_441/master/735.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66ab0d012c73a26859e519f3d8f16a25","title":"hassan al kontar syrian refugee stranded airport asylum canada vancouver","story":"Hassan Al Kontar had been stranded in Kuala Lumpur’s arrival corridor since February after being unable to return to MalaysiaMore than eight months after becoming stranded in the transit zone of Kuala Lumpur’s airport, a Syrian man is finally heading to Vancouver after being granted asylum in Canada.Hassan Al Kontar had been stranded in the airport’s arrival corridor since February, when he was refused permission to board a flight to Ecuador, and was then denied entry by Cambodia and Malaysia.“Tomorrow, I will be reaching my final destination: Vancouver, Canada,” said Kontar in a video posted on Twitter during a layover in Taiwan on Monday. “I could not do it without the help of my family – my Canadian friends and family and my lawyer. Thank you all. I love you all,” he said.Unable to return to Malaysia, where he had overstayed his visa, Kontar was trapped in limbo, in a part of the airport without restaurants or shops. He was forced to sleep under stairwells, shower in a disabled toilet and depend on the generosity of airline staff who donated meals.His frequent video diaries, in which he described the absurdities of his situation, quickly gained a large online following – including Laurie Cooper, a media relations consultant in Whistler, Canada.After contacting Kontar, she and a group of friends petitioned Canada’s immigration minister for the law school graduate to be resettled in Canada, where residents can pool money to privately sponsor refugees.The group quickly crowdfunded more than $13,600 – the amount needed to privately sponsor a refugee for resettlement in Canada, but last month Malaysian authorities arrested Kontar and officials suggested he would likely be deported to Syria.His family, lawyer – and Canadian sponsors – lost all contact with him, but Canadian consular officials worked to arrange his resettlement, which normally takes up to 26 months in Malaysia.“I’m very grateful that Canadian officials, when Hassan was truly in peril, worked very, very hard to expedite the process,” said Cooper.On Sunday, Kontar texted Cooper to say that he was on his way.“I spent the day washing the sheets and making up the bed in my guest room for him,” said Cooper.“It all seemed impossible: I’m a mom who lives in a little log cabin and he was living in an airport,” said Cooper. When he finally lands in Vancouver, the first thing she plans to say to him: ‘We did it!’Since 2015, more than 14,000 Syrian privately sponsored refugees have resettled in Canada."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/001479760b3e2b9867efbcdffe0b9df2b18e8b25/34_32_5552_3332/master/5552.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3254d221f079ee54e769f356bbdd8c0","title":"shares rally as italy signals it may back away from ec budget clash fitse 100","story":"Ever since it came to power in the spring, Italy’s coalition government has been on a collision course with the commission over its plans to stimulate growth by running a bigger budget deficit.The proposed move would violate the eurozone’s fiscal rules and in the past few weeks investors have become increasingly more nervous about Italy’s public finances.The concessions hinted at by the Rome government would go nowhere near far enough to meet the demands made by Brussels, however.The spread between the interest rate Italy pays and the much cheaper interest rates for Germany fell to its lowest in more than a month.Analysts said pressure to revise the budget came from a lacklustre bond sale last week, which suggested that domestic investors are losing faith in Italian assets. Even so, the rally eased as the day wore on as the financial markets grew concerned that the concessions being made by Italy would not be enough.Cyril Regnat, a Paris-based bond strategist at the investment bank Natixis, said he was surprised at both the timing of Rome’s apparent shift after Italy’s deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, recently ruled out tweaking the budget, and the market reaction."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Met \u0026Eacuteireann issues two status yellow alerts with wet, windy, unsettled conditions dueInSight probe lands on a flat plain just north of the planet\u0026rsquos equator called Elysium PlanitiaCriticism over Minister for Sport Shane Ross failure to attend north inner city receptionUnion says some doctors earning up to \u0026euro60,000 less than colleagues appointed after 2012EU study finds disinformation and buying of elections a major concern for Irish electoratePolish authorities are seeking surrender of Artur Celmer (31) who is wanted to face trialBrexit a catalyst for some UK applicants, 312 of whom received citizenship on MondayCoveney urges caution on the part of those opposed to the deal as the UK faces no-deal Brexit if parliament does not back Theresa MayRape survivor urges authorities to show bravery in treatment of victims of sex crimesSinn F\u0026eacutein Senator overall situation handled very badly by Department of JusticeThree young people took their own lives while two were victims of homicide, report findsCatherine Gaffney stole items worth \u0026euro10,150 from Brown Thomas on Dublin\u0026rsquos Grafton StreetCourt hears concerns over the potential impact of Brexit on Irish wards of courtCork Chamber and British embassy launch survey which found 93 per cent of respondents see potential for greater business linksThere is \u0026lsquonothing satisfactory\u0026rsquo about situation of suspended Declan O\u0026rsquoCallaghan, says judgeAmy Lee, with an address at School Street Flats in Dublin, found guilty of neglecting dog\u0026lsquoThe last thing Anthony saw were the forks of that teleporter being driven at him\u0026rsquoD\u0026uacuten Laoghaire Rathdown County Council denies permission for Dalkey schemeObjective of seven-year plan is to increase the use of Irish as a community language in Galway City"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3710106.1543171085!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leo varadkar the alternative to this deal is a no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar discusses the outcome of the EU Council summit meeting in Brussels. “Any other deal really only exists in people’s imaginations.” Photograph: Michelle DevanePA WireThe alternative to the withdrawal treaty between the EU and the UK formally signed off in Brussels on Sunday is “no-deal and a cliff-edge Brexit”, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said after the conclusion of the summit.“It’s going to become more and more obvious that the alternative to this deal is a no-deal scenario,” Mr Varadkar told reporters after EU leaders emerged from the EU Council meeting which approved the text of the withdrawal treaty.Echoing other EU leaders, Mr Varadkar said that the withdrawal treaty is the “only deal that’s on the table”.“I hear a lot of people talking about better deals and alternative deals. And anyone can have a better deal or an alternative deal in their own minds, but an agreement – 500 pages long, that 28 member states can sign up to – nobody has that,” he said.EU leaders were determined to convey the “this deal or no deal” message after a relatively perfunctory summit meeting which concluded after about two hours on Sunday morning, while British prime minister Theresa May also stressed that the current treaty was the best outcome that the UK could expect.Nevertheless, senior sources in both Brussels and the Irish Government acknowledged that the prospects of Ms May securing the acceptance of the British parliament for the treaty – at least on its first vote – were slim.Asked if he was ruling out any change to the exit mechanism from the backstop, which has emerged as a significant issue in London, Mr Varadkar replied: “I am, and it’s not just me, it’s the entire European Union today was very much of the view there couldn’t be a renegotiation.”Mr Varadkar said the “core difficulty” among those arguing for a better deal for the UK was that they “don’t agree among themselves” what a better deal could look like.“So really what’s being put before the European Parliament and the House of Commons is a deal. Any other deal really only exists in people’s imaginations,” Mr Varadkar said.Mr Varadkar said that he understood the position of the DUP, which held its conference in Belfast on Saturday, but he would “posit a counterview”.He said that the deal agreed between the UK and the EU was “very much in line with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement”.He stressed everyone accepted Northern Ireland was and would remain part of the UK until such time as the people of Northern Ireland might vote otherwise, but that because of its “unique history and unique geography” it had special arrangements “that on occasion make it a little different from the rest of the UK”.Citing examples in agriculture, energy, corporation tax, human rights issues and “issues of personal liberty like marriage equality and a woman’s right to choose”, Mr Varadkar said that he didn’t think that “having a special arrangement relating to market regulations on industrial goods is fundamentally different from the special arrangements that exist already”.But, speaking at the DUP conference, MP Sammy Wilson accused the Government of “intransigence” and “not acting in good faith”.Mr Wilson told The  that once the economic implications of the proposed agreement being rejected by the UK parliament become clear, the EU and Irish Government “will be scurrying back wanting to get a deal done”.He argued that the Irish economy would be worst hit in a no-deal scenario where Irish beef, dairy and other agri-food exports to the UK would be hit with high World Trade Organisation tariffs.“We could get beef cheaper from Brazil than we could get from Ireland, so if Irish farmers want their government to ruin their agricultural economy, that is an issue which will have to be dealt with in the Irish Republic,” he said.Ian Paisley jnr, another DUP MP, said technical solutions, including trusted trader schemes and tax gatheringsharing arrangements, should be put “to the forefront of negotiations” to find an acceptable alternative to maintain an invisible border.“If I was the Irish Government, I would be trying to explain to my traders in the south of Ireland why they are not working so hard on a real trade deal,” he said.The DUP, which is keeping Ms May’s minority Conservative government in power at Westminster, is pushing for alternatives to the backstop in the legally binding Brexit treaty.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Mr Varadkar says he expects the British parliament will “sooner or later” support the Brexit deal which has been negotiated between the EU and the UK and agreed upon this weekend in Brussels. He said if Sinn Féin felt they cannot take up their seats because of their absentionist policy, they should consider resigning ahead of a vote on the deal in the House of Commons. “Sinn Féin is an unusual party in that it is not taking up its seats in Westminster for one reason and it isn’t taking up its seats in Stormont for another. “Generally people who get involved in politics get involved because they want to make a difference and use the democratic process to get good outcomes for citizens.“If they are not willing to take up their seats because they feel they can’t, because they got elected on the basis of abstentionism, they do have the option now of resigning their seats and allowing the people in those constituencies decide whether or not they want to have a say when this vote comes to Westminster.”He also sounded a note of optimism around whether the deal can be ratified by the UK parliament. “I think it is likely that the UK parliament sooner or later will agree to what has been agreed by the 28 member state governments.” Mr Varadkar said there had been a lot of focus on the backstop - the insurance mechanism to avoid a hard border in Ireland - but said the arrangement offered benefits to the UK also. “This is the best deal that was available to the UK. I know there is a lot of focus on the backstop but bear in mind one of the big benefits for the UK of the backstop is it provides for a single customs territory if we cannot agree a future relationship as President Macron pointed out yesterday. That means that even if we can’t negotiate a future relationship, the UK will continue to have access to EU markets through a single customs territory.” He said that EU leaders had collectively agreed over the weekend not to speculate too much on what would happen in a no-deal scenario.“What we decided to do at the European Council meeting was to collectively not speculate too much on a no deal scenario or on alternatives to what has been agreed. We don’t want to give the wrong impression to people whether they are passionate Remainers or passionate Brexiteers that there is another deal could command the support of 28 members states, there is not. It is this deal or a no deal scenario.” Mr Varadkar said the government would continue to publish details around its contingency plans where possible.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: Parliament TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May giving a statement to the House of Commons to update parliament on the newly-agreed Brexit deal. Photograph: Jessica TaylorAFPGetty ImagesBritish prime minister Theresa May will stage the make-or-break vote on her final Brexit deal on Tuesday, December 11th after a marathon Commons debate in which the prime minister hopes to turn around the 89 Tory MPs who say they cannot support it.The crucial vote will come at the end of a five-day Commons debate, according to a letter sent out by the Julian Smith, the chief whip, to Conservative MPs that was leaked on Monday afternoon.Dozens of Conservative backbenchers have publicly declared they were unable to support May’s deal, voicing complaints about the customs backstop that would tie the UK to some EU rules if a long-term free trade deal could not be signed.Downing Street said it was well aware of the scale of the opposition. “The number of MPs that there are is well understood,” a government spokesman said, while insisting that Mrs May was confident of winning the vote.Confirmation of the timetable came as the prime minister discussed with her cabinet at a one-hour political session how she was going to sell her Brexit deal to MPs and the country at large.The spokesman added: “Cabinet talked about the strategy we are going to deploy to win the meaningful vote”.However, it is now not thought likely that Mrs May will challenge Jeremy Corbyn to a television debate on the Brexit deal. The idea is one of a number of ideas that had been considered by the government but insiders said: “There are are number of ideas that haven’t got off the ground.”Mrs May said she used the wrong language when she told business leaders her post-Brexit immigration plans would stop EU workers being able to “jump the\u0026nbspqueue”.The prime minister was heavily criticised for the remarks, made in a keynote speech to the CBI’s conference in London last week, where she outlined plans to curb immigration after Brexit.Mrs May told MPs she should “not have used that language” when she was asked about the speech by the SNP’s Philippa Whitford (Central Ayrshire).“I should not have used that language in that speech. The point I was making was a simple one. “Right from the very beginning I said that citizens’ rights was a key issue that I wanted to see addressed in the Withdrawal Agreement.Earlier, Mrs May’s new Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, acknowledged it will be tough to get the deal through a vote in parliament.But he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Ms May has got the best agreement possible for the United Kingdom after her negotiations with Brussels.Asked about how the UK government will get the deal secured by Ms May at yesterday’s summit approved by the House of Commons, Mr Barclay said: “Well it’s going to be a challenging vote.“But it’s now the job of all of us in cabinet to make the case to our colleagues, to make the case to the country.“The prime minister, after two years working day and night in the national interest, has secured a deal that respects the referendum result. And does so in a way that also protects jobs, that also gives security to EU citizens.”Conservative MP Owen Paterson told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme that leaving with no deal would be better for the UK than the deal currently on offer.“There is no chance I will vote for it, I don’t see any chance of it getting through commons,” he said.“There are 90 Conservative MPs who won’t vote for it. There’s a large number of Labour MPs who won’t vote for it, the DUP won’t vote for it.”Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said if Ms May’s Brexit deal fails to make it through Parliament she could be sent back to Brussels to negotiate better terms.Sir Keir Starmer said there is a majority of MPs who would not back a “no deal” scenario and would pressure Ms May to prevent that from happening.Asked if parliament can stop the clock running out on getting an agreement and preventing such an outcome, he admitted any motion by MPs to try and do so might not be binding.He said: “If you had a vast majority saying we don’t authorise the Government to leave with no deal, it would be very difficult for the Government politically to do so.“I accept that may not be legally binding, there would then have to be legislation before March for any Government preparing for no deal and there would be plenty of opportunities to put amendments down to that to require the Government to do things.”European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has said anyone hoping for fresh negotiations would be disappointed within “seconds” if parliament rejects the deal, while Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz added: “This is a take-it-or-leave-it situation.”–Additional reporting: PABloombergDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

There were occasional bursts of cautious applause as it passed critical points of peak heating and parachute inflation.As the probe deployed its 12-metre supersonic parachute, the team clapped with relief. But when the announcer said “touchdown confirmed” they jumped to the air, dancing and cheering.As the dust settled two or three minutes later, Insight relayed the first image taken from one of its two cameras. Commentators described the landing as “perfect” and “flawless”.Debris is seen on the lens in the first image from NASA\u0026#39s InSight lander after it touched down on the surface of MarsIt was due to unfurl its solar panels within hours of the landing.Over the next three months, Insight will deploy instruments designed to probe beneath the Martian surface before it begins to collect information about the planet\u0027s deep structure.Three of those instruments were designed and built by engineers at Imperial College and Oxford University and will listen out for Marsquakes which could hint at the likelihood of previous life on the planet.Over the course of two years, scientists expect to detect between a dozen and 100 of the tremors, which could range up to six on the Richter scale.If successful, the three-legged probe, which launched from California on May 5, will help scientists learn about how rocky worlds like the Earth and Moon formed more than 4.5 billion years ago.The remains of a liquid core could suggest that Mars once had a magnetic field, which would have protected it from harmful solar winds billions of years ago at a time when the planet was warmer and wetter and might have been capable of harbouring early life.The UK Space Agency has invested £4 million in the probe\u0027s short period seismometer (SEIS-SP).An illustration of Nasa\u0026#39s Insight lander about to land on the surface of Mars.The British team, led by Professor Tom Pike at Imperial, said: We should be listening for Marsquakes for at least two years, and we hope considerably longer.It is critical that we set down the instrument in the best place to ensure we\u0027re stable, and then follow up with adding a cover to shield our sensors from the wind.Colleague Dr Neil Bowles, from Oxford University\u0027s Department of Physics, said: The InSight SEIS-SP seismometer is one of the most sensitive and challenging instruments we have worked on for spaceflight in Oxford.Only around four in 10 missions ever sent to the Red Planet have been successful - and they have all been US spacecraft.The European spacecraft Schiaparelli smashed into the planet in 2016 after switching off its retro-rockets too early, scientists believe.It was testing the landing system for a British-built rover to be launched on the second phase of the ExoMars mission in 2020.Back on earth, we will now have to be patient for results from InSight\u0027s mission.While the first pictures of the landing site arrived shortly after touchdown, it will be at least 10 weeks before the science instruments are deployed to begin experiments.It will then be another several weeks for Martian thermometer to dig into Mars. In total, the mission is intended to last two years - or one full Martian year.Read all the details of the full mission here The UK Space Agency invested £4 million in the short period Seismometer (SEIS-SP) on board InSight to measure seismic waves from Marsquakes.Scientists expect to detect anywhere between a dozen and a hundred of these tremors up to 6.0 on the Richter scale over the course of two years.Sue Horne, Head of Space Exploration at the UK Space Agency, said: It is wonderful news that the InSight spacecraft has landed safely on Mars.The UK scientists and engineers involved in this mission have committed several years of their lives to building the seismometer on board, and the descent is always a worrying time.We can now look forward to the deployment of the instrument and the data that will start to arrive in the new year, to improve our understanding of how the planet formed.The lander has sent its first image of its surrounding, confirming to scientists on earth that it has landed safely and is unimpeded by rocks on the surface of Mars. The first image sent from InSight on MarsWe have one more step that we have to do. We have to let the dust settle quite literally, we\u0027re going to kick up a lot of dust when we land, we need to let that dust settle before we want to unfurl our solar ray, he said.We\u0027ll definitely have a celebration ... but we\u0027re going to have to temper that just a little bit while we wait about five-and-a-half hours to know absolutely for sure we\u0027re in good shape.Touchdown has been confirmed for the InSight lander on the surface of Mars. Nasa\u0027s control room has erupted with celebration.InSight has now entered Mars\u0027s atmosphere, starting its tense landing phase.The lander has cleared the peak of its deceleration from 12,300mph to 5 mph before it lands. Parachutes have now been deployed and the craft is monitoring the ground below it. Nasa\u0027s InSight lander has now separated from the cruise stage that protected it on its journey through space.Next, it enters Mars’ atmosphere.InSight is short for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport. As its lengthy name suggests, its objective is to dig into the planet\u0027s interior.One experiment is intended to take Mars\u0027 temperature by drilling down 16 feet (5 meters) into the planet, using a self-hammering nail. Another will calculate Mars\u0027 wobble, providing information about the core of the planet as the sun and its moons pull on Mars.When InSight drills down into the Martian soil, we\u0027ll learn more about how Mars and Earth formed.We\u0027ll know more about where we all came from, and why these two rocky worlds are so similar yet so different, Bill Nye, CEO of the nonprofit Planetary Society, said in a statement. This illustration shows the InSight lander drilling into the surface of MarsDue to the distance between Earth and the red planet, InSight must be able to think for itself during landing and future explortaion experiments.Instructions sent from scientists to the craft would take eight minutes to be received. However today\u0027s landing is expected to take just eight minutes in total meaning the lander must be able to independently react to its surroundings. It\u0027s got its own brain, said lead scientist Bruce Banerdt of Nasa\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It\u0027s got an arm that can manipulate things around. It can listen with its seismometer. It can feel things with the pressure sensors and the temperature sensors. It pulls its own power out of the sun.Scientists at Nasa\u0027a Jet Propulsion Labratory (JPL) which heads up  robotic exploration so plays a huge part in today\u0027s landing are preparing to \u0027pass the peanuts\u0027.A tradition, not superstition - this has become a staple in the day of major missions in which the Nasa team pass peanuts around the room for good luck. It stems all the way back to JPL\u0027s 1964 Ranger 7 mission. Prior to this, the team had suffered six failures, so the pressure was on. An engineer on the day of landing decided to hand out peanuts to his team, and after the mission proved successful, it caught on as a lucky charm. I thought passing out peanuts might take some of the edge off the anxiety in the mission operations room, said Dick Wilson, mission trajectory engineer on the Ranger team. The rest is history.A specially created jar of InSight misson peanuts inside the Mission Control Area (MSA) Life on Mars has long been a topic of fascination in Hollywood, most recently with Ridley Scott\u0027s The Martian starring Matt Damon. But in reality how will InSight\u0027s mission compare to the film?Professor Tom Pike from Imperial College London is part of the Mars InSight team which designed sensors to detect marsquakes. He hopes to pick up tremors on InSight\u0027s mission that will build a picture of Mars\u0027 interior and tell us more about how the planet formed. He spoke to us about InSight\u0027s mission and The Martian, and helped us distinguish fact from fiction. The countdown to the landing beginsThe InSight lander is under two hours away from landing on Mars.The Nasa spacecraft is aiming for an 8pm touchdown on what scientists and engineers hope will be a flat plain.Everyone involved in the $1 billion international mission is understandably nervous. They say they\u0027ve had trouble sleeping, and their stomachs are churning.It\u0027s risky business to descend through the Martian atmosphere and land, even for the US, the only country to pull it off. It would be NASA\u0027s eighth landing on Mars.We\u0027ll be bringing you all the latest updates here this evening as the space agency watch on with baited breath. Please review our commenting policyComment: Nicola Sturgeon jumping the gun on fishing in the Brexit deal exposes her party\u0026#39s ludicrous policyComment: Eight Eurosceptic reasons why we should support Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit agreementTheresa May told her Brexit deal is \u0026#39dead as a dodo\u0026#39 by own MPs as she confirms date of vote to CommonsComment: Matthew Hedges\u0026#39 video confession: real, staged or a hidden message?Trump threatens to close southern US border \u0026#39permanently\u0026#39 as he calls on Mexico to deport migrantsMars InSight mission: What Nasa\u0026#39s trip to Red Planet aims to discoverDonald Trump slams Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal as \u0026#39great for the EU\u0026#39 and warns it will harm UK-US tradeTory MP becomes 27th to back vote of no confidence in Theresa MayKate and Meghan: Is the royal sisterhood really at breaking point?Theresa May: SNP wants \u0026#39real sell-out\u0026#39 of Scottish fishermenComment: Bored with Brexit?

We encourage the public to continue nominating characters until December 14. We will release the list of all eligible nominations once the window closes.Bank of EnglandPlease review our commenting policyTheresa May told her Brexit deal is \u0026#39dead as a dodo\u0026#39 by own MPs as she confirms date of vote to CommonsComment: Matthew Hedges\u0026#39 video confession: real, staged or a hidden message?Nasa Mars landing live: InSight lander touches down on the Red Planet - latest updatesTrump threatens to close southern US border \u0026#39permanently\u0026#39 as he calls on Mexico to deport migrantsMars InSight mission: What Nasa\u0026#39s trip to Red Planet aims to discoverDonald Trump slams Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal as \u0026#39great for the EU\u0026#39 and warns it will harm UK-US tradeTory MP becomes 27th to back vote of no confidence in Theresa MayKate and Meghan: Is the royal sisterhood really at breaking point?Theresa May: SNP wants \u0026#39real sell-out\u0026#39 of Scottish fishermenComment: Bored with Brexit?

Almost a decade ago now he scandalised bankers and traders (although not the general public) when he declared the work of financiers to be\u0026nbsp“socially useless”.A few years ago he made himself almost equally unpopular in central banking\u0026nbspcircles by suggesting they should consider monetising debt to rebalance their economies.Between Debt and the Devil by Adair Turner, book reviewAnd now Baron Turner of Ecchinswell’s latest thesis is that politicians, everyone from the Chancellor Philip Hammond down, are talking rubbish about productivity.“What every politician always agrees is that the crucial thing we need to do is speed up the rate of productivity growth – every politician’s wrong!” the silver-haired 63-year-old declaims\u0026nbspin an interview with The Independent.Turner, whose technocratic career has taken him from the CBI, to the Climate Change Commission, to a major government review of pensions, to the chair of the Financial Services Authority, is now chair of George Soros’ Institute for\u0026nbspNew Economic Thinking. And the economic thinking he’s doing is certainly “new”. Downright heretical, many would say.So what’s led him to this radical conclusion that we should stop obsessing about productivity growth? The answer is twofold.First, he suspects automation is happening quicker than is being picked up by our official GDP statistics. Second, he thinks lots of the new service jobs being created as the mechanisable parts of the economy become\u0026nbspmore efficient are inherently “zero sum”, meaning they are competing for existing wealth rather than creating it.He gives an example of street sweepers and lawyers: “If we manage to create a totally effective automated street sweeping machine, nobody would have a job as a street sweeper. But if we apply IT to the limit to law, there’ll still be lawyers. It’s just that each of these two highly paid lawyers will now have software that review not simply many cases, but every single case that there’s ever been.“What do lawyers do? They fight against each other. If you make lawyer A and lawyer B both much more skilled than they were before, you can’t say there’ll be a better product, there’ll just be a more intense fight.”He thinks that focusing on productivity growth in this context will not help to deliver a higher quality of living for most people. Indeed, he fears it could actually end up harming living standards, citing the example of those who provide social care for the frail elderly.“What do we do with those jobs at the moment? We reduce their status and their cost. We put them up for competitive bidding. And we bid down the price. And then we do these gig economy games where people being paid to do social care of the elderly aren’t even employed for movement between client one and client two we say you’re only working when you’re at the client. Then we tailorise their life. We say ‘you’ve got 14 minutes to clean someone’s bottom’…”The solution, Turner says, banging the desk of his Mayfair office for emphasis, is simply to stop focusing on the bottom line.“We’ve just got to pay more for social care – we’ve just got to make something which is valued. We’ve got to pay higher taxes to afford it. They’re never going to be high-paid jobs, but we should not be using the techniques of the market to skinny them down.”He concedes the macroeconomics of his argument, laid out in an extensive lecture in the US earlier this year,\u0026nbspis unproven. There are certainly many theoretical and empirical challenges that could be mounted. He also accepts that his thesis – saying\u0026nbspwe should focus more on distributing the GDP pie than making it bigger\u0026nbsp– will not be easily swallowed by\u0026nbsppolicymaking classes.Turner advises a start-up online bank – OakNorth – which he says has influenced his views on the rapid underlying speed of job-shedding automation.As chair of a group called Energy Transitions Commission (ETC), made up of public and private sector experts and executives, he’s also advising governments in China and India on decarbonisation.Despite Donald Trump’s withdrawal of the US from the Paris accord, Turner insists he’s relatively hopefully about the prospects of cracking the problem of a rapidly overheating planet.“We’re optimistic that there are bits of Indian policy that are heading in the right direction,” he says.\u0026nbsp“I’m optimistic that China gets it, that they are determined eventually to bring down their emissions, that they’ll develop renewables on a massive scale, that they’ll electrify their bus fleets, etc.“The thing that frustrates me about climate change is that we could get to 2060 and we could have a pretty close to zero carbon economy. Run the numbers and it’s completely doable by technologies that we know how to do. It is soluble if we just get on with it.”But what’s lacking from Turner’s employment portfolio is a major, high-profile, public sector job in the UK. Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour seems an obvious fit. They could use someone with Turner’s economic and establishment credentials.And it turns out there has been some contact. On 19 May (the same day as Harry and Meghan’s wedding) Turner was to be found addressing Labour’s macroeconomic conference.Chair, Institute for New Economic Thinking since 2015But could he work with a party of politicians who\u0026nbspmany in the business world regard as\u0026nbspunreconstructed Marxists, a bigger threat to the economy even than Brexit?“The answer is I’d have to spend a bit more time,” he says, judiciously. “There are some things about some of the people around them of which I am suspicious. There seem\u0026nbspto be some people around them\u0026nbspwho genuinely do believe that Venezuela is a well-run country. You cannot believe that and be sensible. Venezuela is a disaster and it has been destroyed by a left-wing Marxist government that had oodles of oil revenues. You’ve got to say the way that the world is.”But he’s certainly not shutting the door.“There are things that make me wary of that tradition on the left which can see no problems with left-wing governments. On the other hand, there are other aspects of what they are saying that do not seem all that extreme or worrying.”The supreme British establishment technocrat taking a job with a radical left Labour team?

While Baroness Thatcher did work on emulsifiers in ice cream, among other projects, the\u0026nbspfrozen dessert\u0026nbspwas actually invented in America, more than a decade before J Lyons and Co partnered with the US firm Mister Softee to introduce it to Britain.The committee which will actually decide the person to feature on the £50 note has yet to consider the shortlist.A series of better-known scientists, including physicist Stephen Hawking, telephone pioneer Alexander Graham Bell and the discoverer of penicillin Alexander Fleming, are also on the list.Bookmakers have Mr Hawking as the favourite to end up on the banknote. Early computer scientists Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing, and the electromagnetism trailblazer Michael Faraday are also among those thought to be leading the race.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Artist Joseph Hillier and his sculpture - Messenger, depicting a young powerful woman, which will be unveiled next year for Theatre Royal Plymouth.

I\u0027m determined that a future government, a Labour government, will do things very differently including ending bogus self employment.”Creasy announce support for Stand With NG27 campaignMs Creasy added: “The decisions of the National Gallery and the ramifications of this case go far beyond what happens to the 27 iniduals who are taking on this class action.“It\u0027s really the test about whether our public services are behaving in an ethical fashion.Not just in the way that they pay people, but how they treat people when they want to make changes - and what this means in the world today when more and more people are being classed as \u0027self-employed\u0027.The group of 27 educators claim that in total they provided more than 500 years of service to the National Gallery. They welcomed school tours and members of the public to the institution and gave the daily programme of talks, courses and workshops about the works of art on display, as well as delivering learning sessions in schools and hospitals.While the National Gallery classed them as self-employed, the educators said that they worked regularly, were paid through the company payroll, taxed at source and were required to attend training sessions and appraisals. \u0026nbspWhen the gallery moved staff from temporary to permanent contracts, the educators claim they were dismissed with just eight permanent\u0026nbspcontracts offered to the group on reduced salary and terms.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Artist Joseph Hillier and his sculpture - Messenger, depicting a young powerful woman, which will be unveiled next year for Theatre Royal Plymouth.

It is designed to inspire open and honest conversations about mental health by depicting each subjects inner battles on their facesSteven Barrett, a claimant who worked as an educator at the gallery for 13 years, said: “Everything we did was for the National Gallery and not ourselves - we weren\u0027t in any way self-employed.“But it’s not just about us, so many people seem to suffering similar abuse from \u0027bogus\u0027 self-employment. And our case has the potential to be transformative as it is the first time this issue has been located within the public sector.“Marie van der Zyl, partner at Gordon Dadds LLP, the groups\u0027s\u0026nbsplegal representative, said: “Iniduals working in the arts are in need of certainty surrounding their employment rights and it’s essential to ensure they are categorised correctly.”The claimants have set up a page on the crowdfunding website Crowd Justice to raise funds for their legal claim, gathering £70,000 so far.Marie-Therese Ross, a claimant who worked for the National Gallery for 24 years, said: “This isn’t just about us. Our case highlights the exploitation of precarious workers across the arts and beyond.“We are standing up for fair employment rights and calling for our public arts organisations to value the expertise and experience at the heart of their education programmes.”​A spokesperson from the National Gallery said: “The National Gallery has been issued with a number of different claims from a group of freelance workers who have been providing a range of different services for the Gallery (and other museums and galleries across London) on an ad hoc basis for a number of years.The Gallery has not dismissed anyone as part of this process. The majority of the people involved are still providing these services to us on the same basis as previously, whilst others involved in these claims have already accepted either employment or new contracts with us.It is our understanding that the claims have arisen out of the National Gallery\u0027s choice as an ethical employer to change from offering ad hoc work to offering more secure employment, with additional pension and worker benefits.\u0026nbsp“This change also reflects our strategy to develop gallery programmes to reach new audiences and to enhance our engagement with visitors.”The entire group was consulted for their views about the change - both together and inidually - for a period of three months between October 2017 and January 2018.“Jobs were offered to all of our existing freelance service providers last year. We still have vacancies available, although unfortunately not all members of the group have expressed an interest in these.The National Gallery said that the case “should not be likened to the gig economy debate” and that the situation at the gallery was “the opposite”.“We have taken a deliberate choice to move towards a model that offers people secure employment, with additional pension and worker benefits,” the spokesperson added.\u0026nbspThe Central London employment tribunal is expected to rule on the case on 7 December.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The US president\u0027s backing is seen as key for the Middle Eastern kingdom as it seeks to avoid sanctions over the murder of journalist Jamal Khassoggi.Jack Allardyce, oil and gas research analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe said there was no obvious catalyst for the recent slump.“It seems to have been driven by a wider impending sense of doom amidst weak equities, geopolitics, subsequent softening demand and increasing supply,” he said.\u0026nbsp“A lot depends on both the result of US-Sino talks at the G20 this week, and Opec and it’s allies’ meeting on the 6th – it looks as though the market has already decided that the mooted 1.4 million barrels of oil per day cut to output isn’t enough to offset the decline in demand growth projections, so if that is the number then the current level could remain into the new year (or we might see some more weakness).\u0026nbsp“If they opt to make deeper cuts – which seems unlikely given how much the US is leaning on the Saudi’s and Russia’s apparent lack of enthusiasm – then some sort of recovery is likely. As ever, benchmarks seem to move more dramatically than they really should given underlying fundamentals.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Following an investigation, the Competition and Markets Authority\u0026nbsp(CMA)\u0026nbspsaid\u0026nbspit had found that PayPal “could face insufficient competition in the UK after acquiring its market-leading rival”. The CMA also said its findings “raise\u0026nbspconcerns that the merger could result in customers, which include small and medium-sized businesses, paying higher prices or receiving a lower-quality service”.Google’s various payment services streamlined into one platformTommy Robinson banned from PayPalDid Paypal founder buy his New Zealand home as ‘apocalypse insurance’?PayPal completed its acquisition of the Swedish company in September, and the CMA began its probe of the deal in October.If PayPal and iZettle cannot address the regulator’s concerns, the merger will be referred for an indepth investigation. Andrea Gomes da Silva, CMA\u0026nbspexecutive director, said: “Payment services markets are evolving, so it’s particularly important to look to the future when we assess competition and the effects of mergers on customers.“While iZettle is a relatively recent entrant to payment services, it has already established a market-leading position in mobile point-of-sale devices and was well placed to compete against PayPal in other emerging markets. “That’s why we are concerned that PayPal’s takeover could lead to higher prices or reduce the quality of the services available to customers.”A PayPal spokesperson said, “PayPal continues to work cooperatively with the CMA as it conducts its review of the acquisition of iZettle. We are now working to address the CMA’s concerns and demonstrate to the CMA that the market will remain competitive, so we can move forward with integrating iZettle into our global platform.”Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “The fees that small firms incur when processing card payments can cause a real drag on profits and lead to higher prices for customers – \u0026nbspparticularly as businesses are no longer allowed to charge for card use. This is especially the case for firms that handle a lot of low value transactions: coffee shops, barbers, convenience stores.“The CMA is absolutely right to scrutinise this potential acquisition on behalf of smaller businesses.

The pound fell 0.19 per cent to €1.1284 off the back of reports that Italy is headed for a breakthrough with its budget, which would bring to an end weeks of wrangling between the EU and the Italian government. However, the UK currency rose 0.17 per cent against the dollar, to hit $1.2836, after EU leaders signed off on Theresa May’s Brexit deal over the weekend. May prepares to give statement on Brexit deal- liveEU leaders approve Theresa May’s Brexit but say it cannot be changedThe EU\u0027s austerity bias is to blame for the budget standoff with ItalyItaly\u0027s budget crisis is a bigger threat to the EU than BrexitConnor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said the “muted nature” of sterling at the open is “likely because Theresa May’s Brussels success comes laden with some potentially deal-sinking domestic caveats, namely the House of Commons’ ‘meaningful vote’ expected to be held on 12 December”.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, agreed that markets are likely to stay sensitive to any Brexit news in the coming weeks.“The fact that EU leaders have agreed the UK’s exit deal ultimately isn’t enough to convince the market that Brexit will be conducted smoothly,” he said. “Getting the deal approved by parliament is the real hard task, so UK equities are likely to remain volatile until the vote in mid-December.”Meanwhile, Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said sterling traders “know very well that the real struggle is just about to begin”. “There’s a lot of bad news that is currently priced in sterling, but more to come if the deal is voted down by parliament, so expect risk to remain skewed to the downside,” he added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mr Musk\u0027s rocket business is preparing for manned trips to Mars in the coming years, with the hope of making them relatively easily available.Do we really have a right to colonise Mars?You\u0027re 47, Mr Musk was asked as part of an interview for Axios\u0027s\u0026nbspnew show on HBO. What is the likelihood you personally will go to Mars?70 per cent, he replied\u0026nbspimmediately. We\u0027ve recently made a number of breakthroughs that I\u0027m just really fired up about.He went on to explain that he was talking about moving there, and that the price for the trip might eventually be only a couple of hundred thousand dollars.Pressed on whether he was working towards building an escape hatch for rich people, he said that the journey was going to be far more difficult than staying on our own planet would be.Your\u0026nbspprobability of dying on Mars if much higher than dying on Earth, he said, comparing it with Shackleton\u0027s trip to the Antarctic.It\u0027s going to be hard, there\u0027s a good chance of\u0026nbspdeath, going in a little can through deep space, he said.\u0026nbspYou might land successfully, once you land successfully you\u0027ll be working non-stop to build the base. So not much time for leisure.And once you get there, even after doing all this, it\u0027s a very harsh environment so there\u0027s a good chance you\u0027ll die there. We\u0026nbspthink you can come back but we\u0027re not sure. Now does that sound like an escape hatch for rich people?Despite all that he said he would unhesitatingly go and live on the planet, once SpaceX\u0026nbspmakes it possible.There\u0027s lots of people that climb mountains., he said. People die on Mount Everest all the time. They like doing it for the challenge.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

We’ve failed to get answers from Facebook and we believe the documents contain information of very high public interest,”\u0026nbspMr Collins told the paper.Facebook had some “very serious questions” to answer, he said, and he accused it of misleading the committee over Russian involvement in the platform.“It has not answered our questions about who knew what, with regards to the Cambridge Analytica scandal,” Mr Collins said.“We have followed this court case in America and we believed these documents contained answers to some of the questions we have been seeking about the use of data, especially by external developers.”Facebook said: “The materials obtained by the DCMS committee are subject to a protective order of the San Mateo Superior Court restricting their disclosure.“We have asked the DCMS committee to refrain from reviewing them and to return them to counsel or to Facebook.“We have no further comment.”\u0026nbspThe move comes after Mark Zuckerberg said he was “unable” to testify to an international “grand committee” investigating Facebook’s role in spreading fake news.The social media company will instead send Richard Allan, its vice president of policy solutions, to answer questions at a hearing in the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday.Additional reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Try to peer back further, though, and everything changes. The visual, intellectual, spiritual, and day-to-day world of the age that came before seems maddeningly hard to grasp.Back in the 1930s, the authors of 1066 And All That captured something of the frustration: “Egg-Kings were found on the thrones of all these kingdoms, such as Eggberd, Eggbreth, Eggfroth, etc. None of them, however, succeeded in becoming memorable – except in so far as it is difficult to forget such names as Eggborth, Eggbred, Eggbeard, Eggfish, etc. Nor is it even remembered by what kind of Eggdeath they perished.”However, the low middle ages are not truly lost. Pre-conquest England is there – it is just well hidden. Occasional church towers or windows and museum cabinets of jewellery hint at a vibrant period, but it is in books and manuscripts that the Anglo-Saxons come vividly alive, delineated in everything from pale rusty ink to lush gold and lapis. In these texts we meet a vigorous and confident cast of warriors and saints, queens and kings, thegns and villagers, dragons and gods.Anglo-Saxon books are now spread all over Britain and Europe. In a moment of inspiration in 2013, the British Library decided to gather an unprecedented number of them together under one roof.Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms: Art, Word, War is now open, and its 180 exhibits froth and bubble with the whirlpool of fresh ideas and vibrant images that animated England for 700 years. With modern Britain unable to formulate a coherent 21st century identity for itself, the timing of this voyage into the past could not be more relevant.A quick reminder. Anglo-Saxon England thrived from the early AD400s to 1066. As Roman administrators and military commanders hitched their skirts, clambered onto boats, and waved “Valete!” to Britannia, boatloads of Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians eagerly arrived to fill the vacuum.\u0026nbspThe precise details of these migrations remain unclear. Some of the settlers may have been invited as mercenaries to fend off the raiding Scots (from Ireland) and Picts (from Scotland), while others almost certainly arrived to pillage and conquer. Many indigenous Britons were not thrilled. Warlords like Arthur (who may merely be an avatar for others) fought back hard. Yet despite the fierce resistance – the Historia Brittonum tells us Arthur alone slew 960 at the battle of Mount Badon – the settlers prevailed, put down roots, and built communities. Before long the newcomers from modern-day Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands had taken over, and Angle-land (England) emerged.The British Library’s timing is impeccable because the energetic imagination and international adventurousness of the Anglo-Saxons points to a profoundly dynamic period in which England buzzed at the intellectual, spiritual, artistic, and mercantile heart of Europe.9th century\u0026nbsp(British Library)Although there is little room for the Anglo-Saxons in crammed television schedules and bookshops already groaning with Plantagenets and Tudors, the Anglo-Saxons were every bit as important to the development of England. In fact, more so, as they founded it.“The Anglo-Saxon period was a formative one, both for the English and their British and European neighbours,” says Dr Levi Roach, a leading expert from the University of Exeter. “Be it in our towns and villages, our shires and counties, even our names for ourselves (‘English’, ‘Welsh’, ‘Scottish’), they have left an indelible mark.”If you look hard enough, life in modern Britain still has countless legacies of the Anglo-Saxons. Undoubtedly their most important bequest was their language: Ænglisc. (In Old English “sc” is pronounced “sh”, as in biscop or scip.) While the language has always been important in Britain and was exported to the New World and empire, its significance has grown even more in the last generation, with globalisation establishing English as the planet’s emerging lingua franca.This is very likely the first time in their long history that the codices have been together in the same place it’s easy to imagine them as in dialogue with one anotherEnglish may now be ubiquitous, but we rarely credit the Anglo-Saxons for its deep beauty and profound flexibility. For many – like the prime minister – “Anglo-Saxon language” is merely a periphrasis for swearing. This is a pitiful characterisation. Anglo-Saxon (these days rebranded as Old English) is the bedrock of modern English. And actually, there is no evidence any Anglo-Saxon ever uttered the F-word, the notorious monosyllable, or a wide range of other four-letter words.When we want to laud the beauties of historic English, instead of celebrating Anglo-Saxon, we usually skip straight to Shakespeare and the King James Bible. But while both have given us shimmering words and phrases, they were doing no more than wrapping ropes of fairy lights around an already solid, beautiful, old\u0026nbspand leafy tree. The fact is that long before the Globe Theatre rocked with applause, and even before Chaucer’s pilgrims met at the nearby Tabard two centuries earlier, the Anglo-Saxons were speaking and writing the earliest, luscious English.\u0026nbsp“English is a Germanic language,” explains Dr Alison Hudson, co-curator of the British Library’s exhibition. “Anglo-Saxon is the basis of some of its vocabulary and structure.” But the Anglo-Saxons were also devoted linguistic magpies, adept at incorporating new words and ideas. “One of the language’s unique marvels is its flexibility to absorb other elements, like Latin, Old Norse, and Norman French. In this period, we see loan words like ‘pepper’ and ‘cinnamon’ coming into English for the first time. It’s a wonderful reflection of the fact that the British Isles have always been a multicultural place. They even had the word ‘ylp’ for elephant. It’s one of my favourite Old English words. They had no idea what one actually looked like – they imagined it had white polka dots on pink skin – but it was an important enough part of their intellectual world to create a word for it.”Language weaves its way through the exhibition in a similar way to the bright swirls of decoration burnishing many of the old pages. At the dawn of the Anglo-Saxon era we see jagged runes cut into objects from a time when daily life revolved around the old gods and goddesses. As, in a small way, ours still do. Tiw, ruler of sky and war, is still honoured by a day of the week, as is Woden, head of the gods, Thunor, the thunder god, and Frige, goddess of the home and love. Some of these inscriptions are charmingly timeless, like the discreet marketing on the reverse of a piece of delicate gold, ivory, and garnet jewellery: “Luda repaired the brooch”.Æthelberht of Kent’s law code, composed around 600 (Dominic Selwood)The Anglo-Saxons did not cling to the old Germanic gods for long. In 597 St Augustine arrived to re-Christianise England, and one glass case holds an astonishing 6th century book of the four gospels, in Latin, believed to have been in his luggage.Augustine and his companions persuaded the Anglo-Saxons to adopt the religion of Rome, and the new converts became some of its most devout followers. Christianity was a book\u0026nbspand writing-based religion, and the old runes fell into disuse as Anglo-Saxon scholars adopted the Roman alphabet for Latin and Old English. For a while, though, runes clung on in places. The exhibition has a replica of the 5.5-metre high Ruthwell Cross with its spectacular carvings from the life of Christ, along with several verses incised in runes evoking lines from “The Dream of the Rood”.The oldest proper text in Old English is King Æthelberht of Kent’s law code, composed around 600. It is the earliest known utterance of English law, and is the standout exhibit in the exhibition’s first room. It is an extraordinary reminder of just how old our quirky legal system is, with so much of it – including trial by jury – reaching back to principles of Anglo-Saxon justice.As you would expect, the exhibition features stellar examples of Anglo-Saxon art. The mesmerisingly vibrant decoration of the Lindisfarne Gospels (circa\u0026nbsp700) needs no introduction, but equally fascinating are the small words glossed in red ink under the main Latin text. They are in Old English, and represent the earliest known version of the gospels in the vernacular. Strange as this sounds, translating the gospels into English was not that uncommon. The Wessex Gospels – also in the exhibition – were widely copied English versions of the four gospels: something later Tudor scholars in the Protestant Reformation pretended to be undertaking for the first time.What’s amazing about the four great codices is that, for all their riches, they represent just an accidentally surviving tip of an iceberg of poetry long since lost to usThe cases of books in the darkened series of rooms are interspersed with artefacts conjuring up the Anglo-Saxons’ physical world. The Alfred Jewel has pride of place, as do objects like the 5th century pottery Spong Man, which is the earliest Anglo-Saxon sculpture of a person. There are also crowd pleasers from Sutton Hoo and the Staffordshire and Binham Hoards.When Anglo-Saxon England died as a political entity at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, embroiderers depicted the run-up and battle in 58 captioned scenes on 70 metres of linen. Many of its panels show daily life either side of the Channel, preserving one of the richest records of late Anglo-Saxon society. Although the political and military narrative in the Bayeux\u0026nbspTapestry is Norman propaganda – telling their story of why William had God on his side – it is notably sympathetic to King Harold of England, and one of the reasons may be that the embroidery was perhaps made by Anglo-Saxons in Kent. Anglo-Saxon needlecraft – opus anglicanum (English work) – was world famous. The Bayeux Tapestry is not, however, in the exhibition, although President Macron has promised to send it for a visit in the near future, which will be the first time it has crossed the Channel in 900 years.The Anglo-Saxons were energetic travellers and traders, in constant contact with Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. In one glass case there is an astonishing late 4th century book that made it to Anglo-Saxon England all the way from North Africa – possibly in the baggage of Hadrian, a “vir natione Afir” (man of African birth) who travelled to England in 669 and ended up as abbot of Canterbury. In another is a gold coin minted by Offa, who ruled Mercia from 757-96. Although it predictably reads “Offa Rex” on the front, it is modelled on an Islamic dinar, with Arabic writing on the back including “there is no God but Allah alone”. With travel came a thirst for knowledge, and the Anglo-Saxons were also scientists. Books in the exhibition contain diagrams of the planetary orbits and affirmations that the Earth is round.For the real soul of the Anglo-Saxons – the rhythms of their lives, loves, and deeds – there is one standout case. In it are just four books whose names will have any manuscript nerd’s pulse racing. The first is the British Library’s own Cotton Vitellius A XV. It is fire ravaged, but magically preserves the sole surviving copy of Beowulf. Alongside it lies the Vercelli Book – in Britain for the first time in 900 years – containing the only manuscript version of the mystical and haunting “Dream of the Rood”. Next to it is the Junius\u0026nbspManuscript from the Bodleian. Its poems have largely religious themes, and the page is open on “Genesis A”, which offers a good sense of their preoccupations with its nine mentions of heofan and helle. The final volume is the Exeter Book, on loan from Exeter Cathedral. It shimmers with dozens of well-known, ravishing poems, including “The Seafarer” and “The Wanderer”, and lies open on a riddle asking which creature eats words but gains no wisdom. (Spoiler: a bookmoth.) Apart from the transcendent beauty of the words and imagery in these four books, an equally extraordinary feature of them is that they contain around 75 per cent of all surviving Old English poetry.Spong Man, which is the earliest Anglo-Saxon sculpture of a person, from the 5th century (Dominic Selwood)“What’s amazing about the four great codices is that, for all their riches, they represent just an accidentally surviving tip of an iceberg of poetry long since lost to us,” explains Professor Carolyne Larrington, an expert in Old English and medieval European literature at Oxford. “This is very likely the first time in their long history that the codices have been together in the same place it’s easy to imagine them as in dialogue with one another.”The single manuscript copies of Beowulf and “The Dream of the Rood” witness the remarkably poor survival rate of Old English texts. This has nothing to do with either the amount the Anglo-Saxons wrote or the quality of their materials. They wrote prolifically, and their vellum and bindings were perfectly robust, as many books in the exhibition demonstrate, with thumping leather-tooled and richly gem-studded covers showing no signs of fragility.\u0026nbspThe loss of so much Anglo-Saxon writing has far more to do with the purposeful and systematic 16th century destruction of monastic and university libraries by the Tudors, whose religious policies saw bonfires and rubbish heaps made of books that referred to England’s medieval faith. Religious sculpture, too, was also decimated. The original Ruthwell Cross, with its extraordinary runic poetry inscriptions, was smashed into fragments by Protestant extremists in the 1640s, but was meticulously reassembled in the 1820s, and now stands inside Ruthwell Church in Dumfriesshire.\u0026nbspLater, a handful of notable figures tried to repair the damage and locate the books and manuscripts that had been scattered. “Despair over the fate of the contents of monastic libraries crossed confessional boundaries,” explains Professor Helen Parish, an expert in late medieval and Reformation history at the University of Reading. “The former Carmelite turned ardent evangelical, John Bale, had little sympathy with the trappings of monasticism, but still complained bitterly that the dispersal of the libraries was to the shame of the country. Matthew Parker, first archbishop of Canterbury in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, worked hard in the 1560s to recover lost books and records. His library at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, provided the building blocks for a new history of the English church, and a burgeoning sense of national faith and identity in which the Anglo-Saxon church was the cornerstone.”\u0026nbspOne especially notable feature of the surviving corpus of Old English poetry is the prominence of women characters. Hudson explains:\u0026nbsp“There are a surprising number of Anglo-Saxon epics of strong women. Biblical characters like Judith, saints like Juliana – a Middle Eastern martyr who battled and conquered demons – and royalty like the Empress Helena. In the Genesis poem in the Junius manuscript, even Eve emerges as a notably prominent character.”Strong women are not only part of the Anglo-Saxons’ poetic world. They were part of everyday life, too. Æthelflæd, daughter of King Alfred and wife of Æthelred of Mercia, was named “Lady of the Mercians” and did more to bring England together as a country than possibly anyone else. Her deeds are recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which sits in the same room as the four poetry books. Less regal Anglo-Saxon women’s lives are also fascinating. The exhibition has the late 10th\u0026nbspor early 11th century will of the noble widow Wynflæd, and it contains two arresting provisions. On her death she freed some of her slaves, but not Eadgifu the weaver or Æthelgifu the seamstress. And she could read, as she carefully passed on her prized collection of books.\u0026nbspIf asked to name an Old English poem, many people would nominate Beowulf. It is rightly one of the most famous stories in Anglo-Scandinavian literature, and the original manuscript does not disappoint. The poem’s 3,182 lines throb with a ripping tale of the warrior Beowulf’s mortal combat with the monster Grendel and his mother and, years later, with a dragon. The epic’s ability to transfix and delight wins new admirers every generation: most recently with Nobel prize winner Seamus Heaney’s free translation in 1999 and Hollywood warhorse Robert Zemeckis’s epic A-list motion capture blockbuster in 2007.\u0026nbspAfter Beowulf, the most famous Old English poem is “The Dream of the Rood”, in which the cross of the crucifixion tells its version of the passion story. It opens with the writer having a vision of the cross that will soon speak to him:Listen! I wish to tell of the best of dreams,\u0026nbsp(You only need to know two things to read it aloud: “æ” is pronounced “a” as in “cat” and “ð” and “þ” are both pronounced “th”.)\u0026nbspIf you read, it, two things pop out immediately. The first is that the sound and cadences are deeply rhythmical, and almost certainly mean it was recited to music. The second is that the phrases are built up with a hypnotic alliteration that is perhaps the most defining characteristic of Old English poetry.\u0026nbspIt is, obviously, more challenging than Shakespeare or Chaucer as it has many unfamiliar words and comes complete with case endings. We have managed to get rid of most of them in modern English, although a few like “them” and “whom” stubbornly remain. To add to the challenge, many Old English words have also changed their meaning over time. For instance, “spell” simply meant “story” to the Anglo-Saxons.Old English also had dialects which evolved. The main ones were based in Northumbria, Mercia, Kent, and Wessex, with Wessex eventually coming to dominate, as it was the language of King Alfred – who was a fervent promoter of literacy – and later of Ælfric, abbot of Eynsham, who wrote and standardised the language prolifically.Selwood)Despite the strange look and feel of some Old English words, there is no reason to be put off. It is not as alien as it may sometimes seem. Neither does it only live in universities, libraries, and museums. JRR Tolkien was an Oxford professor of Anglo-Saxon for years, and if you enjoy any of the vocabulary of Middle Earth, you are revelling in his profound skill at playing with ancient Germanic-style languages.\u0026nbspOther standout treasures in the exhibition include the pocket-sized St Cuthbert Gospel, which belonged to St Cuthbert of Lindisfarne (died 687). It is the oldest European book with an original intact binding, in this instance an exquisitely decorated red goatskin cover, all miraculously preserved by having been placed into the saint’s tomb alongside him.Another is the bible known as the Codex Amiatinus. It was produced alongside the St Cuthbert Gospel at Wearmouth-Jarrow but, by contrast, is vast. With a spine over a foot thick, it takes two people to lift it and is the largest book in the exhibition. It was once one of three identical copies, but Amiatinus is the only one to survive, as soon after it was finished Abbot Ceolfrith (died 716) took it to Italy as a gift to the pope, and its homecoming to England for the exhibition is the first time it has been back in over 1,000 years.\u0026nbspIn the final room of the exhibition, beautifully lit and residing in a central case, is the most famous book ever produced in England. At Christmas 1085, William the Conqueror ordered a survey of his country, its land, and how it was occupied. Foremost in his mind was – as so often with rulers in any age – the question of property ownership and how much tax he could raise from it. Thanks to the Anglo-Saxons’ meticulous organisation of England into counties and hundreds, the research only took his commissioners until\u0026nbsp1\u0026nbspAugust the following year. When it was all written up, the result was nicknamed the Domesday Book, from the Old English “domesdei” – meaning the Day of Judgment – because the book’s record, like that of the Last Judgment, was unappealable.\u0026nbspHistory books will be harsh on us for ignoring YemenA brief history of pop-culture feudsWhy your Halloween witch’s outfit is rooted in a gendered stereotypeOn one level, the legacy of the Anglo-Saxons is something that is better appreciated outside England. We call the world’s English-speaking countries the “Anglosphere”, whereas the French choose the more nuanced “le monde Anglo-Saxon”, hinting at a distinct historic, linguistic, cultural, and philosophical heritage.\u0026nbspThe French also have no real concept of “the Dark Ages”, and the equivalent period in France has no label implying that it was unenlightened. Of course, as the exhibition demonstrates unequivocally, there never was a dark age. It is a myth dreamed up by Whig historians wanting to believe that Europe collapsed from glory into barbarity with the fall of Rome, but from the Normans onwards the British Isles marched unstoppably towards ever more profound progress and civilisation. The other reason the French have no dark ages is, of course, that they did not experience a regime as violent with history and cultural property as the Tudors.It is shameful that we so often start our islands’ history and lists of kings and queens with William the Conqueror, as if before his arrival there was a void with darkness over the deep. Britain had spectacular cultures before 1066, of which the Anglo-Saxons were one. Theirs was an intense, vibrant, literate, artistic, creative, spiritual, intellectual, practical, adventurous, outward-looking, European world. It was also a prize well worth conquering, which is why Cnut the Dane seized the throne in 1016 and William of Normandy followed him 50 years later.

At six I wake in the box room bedroom at my grandparents that I’ve claimed as my own since coming to Cheshunt as a baby. Suddenly I’m 51: this is the last time I’ll ever sleep in this three-bed former council house on an estate on London’s northern edge. My paternal granddad Leslie died in 2014 and for over a year my nan Eileen has languished in a care home with worsening dementia, which means never again will she return to the house that for all those decades was the family home.After my grandfather returned from war, he, Nan and my infant father moved into a two-bed semi on a large estate being built for heroes called Bury Green: one of Nan’s ways to make ends meet was to clean the newly completed houses after the workmen had finished, walking the plank across muddy foundations, my father in her arms. When a larger, three-bed place came up further in they moved, the neighbours mucking in with hand carts.Empty houses are depressing, and this house has lain empty for more than a year it smells dank, there are cobwebs, and half the family photographs have been removed from the wall leaving a patchwork of anachronistic memories. Soon, when Nan dies, or her savings run out, this house, the sole childhood home of my dad, uncle and auntie – which my grandparents agonised over buying due to their socialist principles – will be sold. After half a century, I look round for a final time, and close the door.How a family hiking trip left me thinking about mortalityRecently I realised that dozens of places important to my family stretching back 100 years took place along the A10New River layline between Cheshunt and Soho. The birthplace of my father, two of my grandparents and my two children the places where I, my parents, and grandparents, met our partners and where we married several of my former homes, plus the ones in which my mum, dad and grandparents grew up schools and universities where me, my kids, my parents and grandparents studied and worked, are all strung along a 20-mile route which I have decided to walk in one day: a long trek into my past, back to the warm heart of my city.The November sun is rising over “New” River (dating from 1613) at the end of the street, the same street on which Cliff Richard was raised and whose forged autographs my father sold round school as a kid. Cutting through the alley where I learnt to ride my bike and where louts often linger with flickering lighters, I leave the estate, passing the graveyard where my great-grandmother Flo is buried, and cross the metal footbridge that crosses the A10, watching trucks and cars thunder to and from London.Being political animals, my granddad ran the tenant’s association, Nan the Labour women’s section. One day in the Fifties she invited an earnest young prospective candidate (who had no chance despite estates like Bury Green, Cheshunt was Tory) to speak to the Labour ladies about his policies. Nan was mortified by the way the other women sat, listened and carried on knitting, needles flashing and clicking like praying mantes. The pleasant young man was Dennis Potter: years later, Nan would watch his TV play Vote, vote, vote for Nigel Barton\u0026nbspand shudder with recognition.Piggott and his mum Flo in 1915\u0026nbspAs you walk east on College Road a huge tree – possibly a cedar of Lebanon – that has barely changed since I was a kid marks the start of Blindman’s Lane. Here, at 55, my paternal grandfather Leslie Piggott grew up in a bungalow without hot water, one of five siblings to Florence and Edwin Piggott, who were doubly blessed. First, because Ed was stone deaf, thus escaping the trenches second, because he was a nursery foreman which meant there was always food on the table – unlike many homes in what in the Twenties was one of the poorest rural districts in England. (Their luck would change: their only daughter died of cancer and their son Vincent was killed in action in the Second World War).Even when I was a kid – spending many of my school holidays in Cheshunt – the town had become a distant suburb of London, joined by the threads of rail, river and road, but back in the Seventies the town was overwhelmingly white Tesco ran the town like the Cosa Nostra. Today’s inhabitants are more erse and Turkish grocers surround the Old Pond in my granddad’s youth, the only Turk most Cheshunt people would have met would have been at Gallipoli.Piggott at St George’s Church in 1940\u0026nbspAt Old Pond roundabout – where Vincent Piggott’s name is inscribed on the war memorial – I turn right down Turners Hill, past the library where my grandfather worked as a teen before discovering the money in the factory was better, past the site of long-demolished Merston House where he was born in 1915. Turners Hill merges into Crossbrook Street, which runs down to Waltham Cross (still as ugly as the day I was born) and has another family connection. In 1944, when my father Michael was just two weeks old, my grandfather wrote him a letter from his RAF base:“On a certain April evening in 1939, my pal ‘Ginger’ Liddard and I were off for a stroll and a drink along Crossbrook Street to Waltham Cross. In those days, I’m afraid, I was rather a heavy drinker, but anyhow I’ll leave the explanation of my sins until later, so back to my story. We had just passed Cheshunt Building Society when all of a sudden we heard a ‘Hullo’ from the opposite side of the road, and when ‘Ging’ and I looked over we saw, what appeared to us in the dim light, a pair of very young girls. We stuck our noses in the air, said ‘schoolgirls trying to be funny!’ and passed on our way to the nearest pub. On our way back to Cheshunt we ran into the two ‘schoolgirls’ again, this time on our side of the road, and lo! And behold! They were not schoolgirls but very pleasurable young ladies of some 17 years of age…”Places change: so, too our perceptions. I used to associate Archway with pubs, kebabs and scary underpasses now sealed over but that was in another lifeOne of the girls was one Eileen Ball from Enfield. The pair began courting Nan was much impressed by Granddad’s good manners, smart appearance and relative affluence as a skilled toolmaker he earned double most of his contemporaries. In 1940, Granddad was given leave from the RAF where he now worked as a Spitfire mechanic beneath Guy Gibson to marry Nan at St George’s Church, Hertford Road. The photographs of their wedding day will be instantly familiar to anyone with English ancestry: grandfather in uniform, grandmother in white. Go into any English home and you’ll find variations on the theme: an ancestor in uniform, smiling uncertainly into the lens (not wanting to be at the centre of this or indeed of anything), a determined, set look keep calm, and if you come home carry on propagating the genes.St George’s has hardly changed, to my unpractised eye: red brick, imposing, small memorial garden out front where a mourning woman lays flowers. A couple of streets further down I pass Unity Road, where my father was born in 1944. Bombing raids were a part of life: years later my nan, an air raid warden in the factory where she worked, recalled:“When Michael was about six weeks old, early one evening, I was breastfeeding him when we heard the sound of what we thought was a hit plane coming down. I shot under the table in my mum’s dining room crouching over Michael, who, luckily, was blissfully unaware of the danger and went on suckling!”Unity Road is suburban, low-rise, and seems more affluent than the surrounding blocks. I have a photograph from May 1945 of a Unity Estate VE tea party, Nan holding my father in her arms (unmissable, due to her habit of tippexing outlines round family members in any group photos). Now, on the corner, perhaps on the very site of that street party, stands a vast Lidl.From Unity Road it’s a slog through scrofulous suburbs and a characterless stretch of the A10 (the factories in which Granddad worked – Murex, Thorns, Manifold – are now retail parks) to Bertram Road, Bush Hill Park. My nan was born at 104, and grew up at 122, poor, half her father’s weekly wage of £2 from Ediswans lightbulb factory going on the rent.Nan’s dad, Arthur Ball – a name I imagine caused some merriment in the factory – also worked in the factories up the A10. Enfield was heavily industrialised and would be a prime target during the war. One of Arthur’s workmates was Jimmy Dimmock: he worked in the factory all week, then turned out for Spurs of a Saturday. When unemployed, which was often, Arthur – teetotal, musician, talented painter – set up a group for dole-drawers in a hut. He sat Eileen on his knee when she was five and explained how everyone had a right to clean linen nan took it to heart. She left school at fourteen to help out and got a job at the same factory as her dad, where she was known like all the typists as an “office tart”,\u0026nbspand at dinner time Arthur would come through the rubber doors that separated classes (factory and office pool) with his trolley and give her jam sandwiches a taste of an older England long since gone to Pot Noodle.Despite her poverty, Nan’s memories of childhood are generous and rich, recalling games in the street, kids in and out of one another’s houses, evenings round the piano, doting grandparents nine doors down.The current occupier of Nan’s childhood home, Peter, generously lets me come in and see the place Nan was raised. Peter, a rough, friendly decorator of 53, and his wife have lived here for years but are shortly moving to Winchmore Hill.I’m surprised at the size of the house, with its big back garden and kitchen extension, and have to remind myself that when Nan lived here the extension wouldn’t have existed, and lacked even electricity, let alone flatscreen TV.From Bertram Road it’s a drab, dreary walk to Arnos Grove, passing through the middle-class ghetto of Winchmore Hill (where my mother grew up in the station house), the site of Minchenden Grammar (which Mum attended with Lynne Franks and Martin Rushent), Mum’s first place of work – the Metal Box Company on the North Circular – to the former council flat where her father, my maternal granddad, resides. All these suburban streets look the same, and I keep getting lost: at one low point I have to double back and walk a mile out of my way uphill. I’m less than halfway through my odd odyssey and exhausted, and for the first time begin to worry I won’t make it, chide myself for failing to do any preparation whatsoever – unless you count walking to the offie.Despite Granddad’s claims, the Piggotts weren’t drinkers and the Balls of Methodist stock so when it comes to alcohol, I must take after my mum’s parents. My mum’s mum, Kit Walsh, had to leave Ireland when she got pregnant there are rumours Mum has an older sibling somewhere who was given away. When I was born my nan was still only 36 she’d give me whiskey to help me sleep. Nan was what you might call a character, and great fun. On one occasion when I stayed as a kid, she came in saying she’d just met Jesus on the tube. We thought she’d finally lost it then it transpired she’d met Robert Powell and given him whiskey from the bottle she kept in her fake fur coat and taught him to sing The Men Behind The Wire.Now 95, Jack Brown has lived in a smart three-bed flat in one of the four-storey blocks for 50 years, raising with Kit six children. Many of my holidays as a child were ided between here and Cheshunt, between my two sets of grandparents. Today all the blocks are covered in scaffolding, making them seem grimmer than ever: there’s no entry phone and when I bang on Granddad’s door he shouts fearfully from within: “Who’s that?”“Me, Granddad. Mark.” (Adding, as always:\u0026nbsp“Sandy’s son.”)Granddad opens the door, looking every day of 95: he is short, as are all my forebears, five two, stocky, face still fierce, still with a purple boozer’s nose though he can no longer drink anything but J2O. He shuffles back to the lounge on his walking stick and we sit at his desk. Kit died at Chase Farm in 2008 a few years later my mum’s youngest brother, my uncle, five years younger than me, assaulted his dad and went to prison. An exclusion order remains in place, and now Granddad’s only visitors are a daughter and her partner. I ask Granddad how he is.“Not so good,” he growls, still with a faint Ipswich burr in his accent after all the decades. “I got robbed.” A week earlier, two young men posing as workmen on the renovation used fake ID cards to gain access one distracted my grandfather while the other took £400 he’d been saving to buy his communist chums a pint for his birthday. A few days later, just down the road, a 98-year-old was beaten almost to death for his TV.Granddad looks shaken, vulnerable: this family is no stranger to bleak times (Nan mugged on her way home from Bingo, Uncle Liam, stabbed, Uncle Liam, brain-damaged, Uncle Liam, diagnosed with MS, Uncle Liam – who gave me my middle name – who died this year), but I sense this might be the last straw. What a sad end for a man who stood as a Communist Party MP, who ed into burning seas to save Navy comrades after his ship was torpedoed, who worked for 40 years for British Rail, where he showed John Betjeman how to change signals and who once travelled to Moscow with Kit by train. Nan Brown often told me how they were invited to a grand ball in Moscow and as they ascended the sweeping staircase she hissed at my grandfather: “Jack! Your flies are undone!” “That’s nothing,” said Granddad. “You’ve got your dress tucked in your knickers.”Created with Sketch.The London that could have been Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Planned in the 1960s when bus use was declining and personal car use was increasing.

Now I recall Nan Piggott telling me of the reception at my mum and dad’s wedding, where my Irish nan’s contribution to the buffet was a string of uncooked sausages and where during a slow dance Jack slid his hand down over Eileen’s bottom as his wife suggested wife-swapping to shocked Granddad Piggott: two very different families, brought together only briefly in a ceremony at Haringey Civic Centre, my mum’s black dress bulging visibly, guests including Fairport Convention.Neither my mum or dad recalls the date they married (the marriage itself only lasted two years), but both recall where I was conceived: at a Socialist Labour League conference in Morecambe, shortly after friend-of-the-Redgraves Gerry Healy told Mum: “I will sleep with you on the eve of the revolution.”For a time, Mum and Dad lived in Rosebery Road, Muswell Hill, in a house with a shared bathroom Mum recalls bopping around the living room to Dizzy Gillespie as her belly expanded. Dad was quite the lad about town in the mid-Sixties: hanging out in jazz clubs and\u0026nbspshebeens, a groovy dude in velvet pantaloons. Once, he tells me, Rod Stewart nicked his dope another time he was on the door of a party in Chelsea when four scruffy looking louts tried to enter. Dad barred their way, to be informed he’d bounced the Rolling Stones. Dad got into an unspecified spot of bother and the young couple went north to Manchester, where I was born: a northerner in spirit but not a drop of northern blood.From Wood Green it’s another slog, through Hornsey and Crouch End and up the hill to Hornsey Rise, then right along Hornsey Lane, thoroughly exhausted now, wolfing eclairs and Coke, the unseasonal November sun blinding. Just before Suicide Bridge – immortalised, if that’s the word, in my first novel Fire Horses – a passing white van smashes the wing mirror of a parked van and the debris of glass and torn metal hits me: the van doesn’t stop. Nor do I. Standing on the bridge I look down over the bowl of my city, London proper.Empty houses are depressing, and this house has lain empty for more than a year it smells dank, there are cobwebs, and half the family photographs have been removed from the wall leaving a patchwork of anachronistic memoriesArchway Tower – where I used to sign on – has been transformed into an apartment block, reflecting the transformation of an area which in the 1980s – when I lived in a condemned row for three mostly unhappy years – was dubbed “where angels fear to tread”. We stuck the article on the wall, a badge of pride. Much of those years are now just a blur: dropping acid during the Great Hurricane, drinking with Pete Postlethwaite a blazing row with Kathy Acker.In my first published story, “Hatful of Holloway”, I imagined a terror attack in which Archway Tower is blown up and falls onto what used to be the Archway Tavern, a rough Irish pub where they cashed your giros at a counter and men waited each morning at six for the van to the site. The same year that story was published, I was at Archway Station with my wife and baby daughter when we heard about the 77 terror attacks: I remember looking down Junction Road, trying to work out the safest way home with our precious pram cargo, and suddenly it looked like a corridor of glass.Places change: so, too our perceptions. I used to associate Archway with pubs, kebabs and scary underpasses now sealed over but that was in another life. Crossing Highgate Hill, where Dick Whittington turned again, I walk down Dartmouth Park Hill, past the Whittington Hospital where two years apart our two children were born in the same delivery room, a continuation of a process of self-gentrification that mirrors the new N19, where plastered Irish builders have become Damian Lewis and Benedict Cumberbatch. My Irish nan drank in the Boston in the 1950s, telling me how anyone who refused to put money in the IRA collection plate was thrown out the window the Boston remains satisfyingly down-market, with racing on the TV and smokers congregating at the door even as goths queue for the Dome next door.Limping past Cathcart Hill, where I lived from 1999 to 2013 with my wife and then our two children after nine brief months in the country we were pulled back, to Finsbury Park (where, in 1987, I presented Network Seven and hung out with junkies on Six Acre and Andover) and then back to the manor, to Warrender Road, where we live today.Utterly exhausted I enter the house: my wife makes me tea and sandwiches, Daughter, 14, teases me about my bedraggled appearance Son, 12 shows me the game he’s been creating on his laptop. It would be so easy to sit here and sleep: but I have made a promise, to myself at least, so after dumping my bag I say goodbye and walk, past Mercers Road, the first house in London I lived in aged 18, where a regular visitor – much to my excitement – was Roland “Fine Young Cannibals” Gift, then at the peak of his fame. In the distance I see London Met on Holloway Road, where I took a degree 10 years later, and where, 10 years after that, my first novel was launched (and sank without trace).Past Lloyds Bank at Highbury Corner, part of which used to be a curry house above which I shared a room with my oldest friend which had no windows, and maggots on the carpet, and where we had to place a disconnected door in the door-shaped hole to allow the other to defecate in peace. Where, the day in 1991 I received the letter confirming I’d been allocated my own little flat, I picked up a bottle of cider from the floor, took a swig in celebration, then realised it contained urine.Highbury Corner, where the Islington Twins used to hang out, and those older, odder twins used to walk up and down in matching checked suits, and where I once slept in bushes at the centre of the roundabout, and The Cock, where Arthur Mullard made me get off his stool. Down Upper Street, past 127, the site of Brown and Blair’s infamous Granita Pact, which I mentioned in a novel past the red-brick Municipal Office where I both worked and signed on past the town hall where in 2003 my wife and I were the first to be married in the chambers: we appear on council literature. My mum and dad met just around the corner, at an SLL meeting: they saw eye to eye, not only politically, but physically, dad being 5ft 2in, mum 4ft 11in.Between them they were over 10ft tall.To the Angel and past Nags Head, for so many years our pub of choice: sometimes when I had no money I’d walk up and down Upper Street for hours, watching all the drinkers behind warm glass. Taking a right up White Lion Street I pass a Hilton, bemused: in the 1980s King’s Cross was still rough. Up York Way, we attended “acid rock” warehouse parties in 1986 today I turn south onto Amwell Street, passing the flats where I lived with J and her mum back in 1989-90 before it all fell apart (all me – my bad).Filthy McNasty’s – where I set a key scene of my first book, and once drank with Shane MacGowan – is now the George and Monkey. One night on mushrooms I had a bad trip there, and Amwell Street extended to eternity. At Roseberry Avenue I pass Finsbury Town Hall, where I was once best man, stinking drunk because I’d just been on the telly.Exmouth Market had pie’n’mash and jellied eels when I lived in the Peabody Flats (1991-98) I pass the pub where the blind man used to give his guide dog Guinness in an ashtray. Down the steps I staggered down a thousand times: in Australia, 1994, homesick, I was watching A Fish Called Wanda when I saw those same steps, my own flat. I look up at the tiny bedsit where I lived and died a thousand deaths, crushed by loneliness and rage some rainy winter Sundays I would walk from my flat to the Thames without seeing a soul, go days without uttering a word. I became so introverted, so lacking in confidence and self-esteem that I began to imagine a huge coat which as I walked through the snow would erase all my footsteps, leave no trace. But then Clerkenwell Green around the corner is where I explained to J that one day, I would be quite the catch, and she laughed and at Clerkenwell Green I learnt my first novel was to be published.I’d only been living in Farringdon Lane a few months when a new neighbour moved into the flat directly upstairs. By a bizarre coincidence it was J’s best friend D, with whom we’d once trekked across Europe D now worked as a childminder for Mike Leigh and told him about this strange event. A year or two later, when Naked was released, I was somewhat perturbed by the similarities between the Thewlis character and myself. Pure coincidence, of course though later, when D told me about Secrets and Lies and I asked if it was about her, D laughed and said – “No, Mark – it’s about you. Again.”When I first got involved with the magazine, I was also still vaguely involved with Class War, agitating at Wapping, appearing on page 2 of The Sun holding a misspelt banner when Princess Anne came to tour the youth project I was locked in a room because they were scared that I’d burst out with placards.Memorial for Sikh soldiers vandalised in first week after unveilingBrain implants will soon allow hackers to ‘manipulate memories’How memory can help build confidence in the kitchenIt has grown dark, and as I begin the final stretch to Soho in my long back coat, I feel invisible. Am I really here, or just another ghost in a city full of ghosts from Roman armies to Amy Winehouse? My steps and breath shorten the pain in my thighs, calves, feet, hips intensify: but now I know I will make it.I pass the Phoenix, site of my second book launch in 2010, when it seemed authordom was mine and easy. Eighteen months later I was back on the dole. As I limp up Shaftesbury Avenue each step is a torment, but now I see my destination just across the road, in Soho proper: The Coach and Horses.Why end here? Well, I had to end somewhere, so why not a pub – one I frequented when Jeffrey Bernard propped up the bar, and I had to restrain a mate from flattening Norman Balon who’d called him a cunt, and where, years later, for two short hours, I was part of the media aristocracy?Entering, I order a Guinness. The barmaid smiles and serves. I check my pedometer: 48,664 steps, 20.7 miles. No, there’s another reason I picked this pub.1999: My lowest ebb. Having graduated from college and secured an agent I borrowed £10,000 from a bank in anticipation of the advance that was surely coming, and never did. With fellow loons I drifted across the capital, drinking and taking whatever else I could find all night and day, sometimes sleeping rough at one point in Oxford Street I lay on the bonnet of a car and was carried for several hundred yards. Then, later, as police came to arrest me for causing a disturbance in my flats, I smashed my fist through a window and almost severed the hand entirely I was rushed to hospital but after being bandaged left again, still buzzing. Next morning a doctor removed the temporary bandage and I saw my severed wrist, tendons and veins dangling, like a robot I was rushed back to hospital for emergency surgery.A few days later I wandered into the Coach and Horses, Soho, where a pretty trainee nurse from Liverpool smiled and seeing my ragged, loose sling said in a kind voice:“Are you OK?”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The US president\u0027s backing is seen as key for the Middle Eastern kingdom as it seeks to avoid sanctions over the murder of journalist Jamal Khassoggi.Jack Allardyce, oil and gas research analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe said there was no obvious catalyst for the recent slump.“It seems to have been driven by a wider impending sense of doom amidst weak equities, geopolitics, subsequent softening demand and increasing supply,” he said.\u0026nbsp“A lot depends on both the result of US-Sino talks at the G20 this week, and Opec and it’s allies’ meeting on the 6th – it looks as though the market has already decided that the mooted 1.4 million barrels of oil per day cut to output isn’t enough to offset the decline in demand growth projections, so if that is the number then the current level could remain into the new year (or we might see some more weakness).\u0026nbsp“If they opt to make deeper cuts – which seems unlikely given how much the US is leaning on the Saudi’s and Russia’s apparent lack of enthusiasm – then some sort of recovery is likely. As ever, benchmarks seem to move more dramatically than they really should given underlying fundamentals.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Following an investigation, the Competition and Markets Authority\u0026nbsp(CMA)\u0026nbspsaid\u0026nbspit had found that PayPal “could face insufficient competition in the UK after acquiring its market-leading rival”. The CMA also said its findings “raise\u0026nbspconcerns that the merger could result in customers, which include small and medium-sized businesses, paying higher prices or receiving a lower-quality service”.Google’s various payment services streamlined into one platformTommy Robinson banned from PayPalDid Paypal founder buy his New Zealand home as ‘apocalypse insurance’?PayPal completed its acquisition of the Swedish company in September, and the CMA began its probe of the deal in October.If PayPal and iZettle cannot address the regulator’s concerns, the merger will be referred for an indepth investigation. Andrea Gomes da Silva, CMA\u0026nbspexecutive director, said: “Payment services markets are evolving, so it’s particularly important to look to the future when we assess competition and the effects of mergers on customers.“While iZettle is a relatively recent entrant to payment services, it has already established a market-leading position in mobile point-of-sale devices and was well placed to compete against PayPal in other emerging markets. “That’s why we are concerned that PayPal’s takeover could lead to higher prices or reduce the quality of the services available to customers.”A PayPal spokesperson said, “PayPal continues to work cooperatively with the CMA as it conducts its review of the acquisition of iZettle. We are now working to address the CMA’s concerns and demonstrate to the CMA that the market will remain competitive, so we can move forward with integrating iZettle into our global platform.”Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “The fees that small firms incur when processing card payments can cause a real drag on profits and lead to higher prices for customers – \u0026nbspparticularly as businesses are no longer allowed to charge for card use. This is especially the case for firms that handle a lot of low value transactions: coffee shops, barbers, convenience stores.“The CMA is absolutely right to scrutinise this potential acquisition on behalf of smaller businesses. It’s vital that – if completed – the merger doesn’t lead to even higher prices for card processing services or stifle much-needed innovation.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It will offer an unprecedented insight into the activity beneath that dusty surface.Latest as Nasa arrives on MarsEven as the craft makes its way to the ground, engineers will be using their intense practising to ensure that InSight\u0026nbsplands so that its sensors can be used. It will be directed so that even if it lands on a rock, or on its side, it will still be able to stick its sensors into the planet and examine it.Engineers will then decide where they are going to aim those sensors. They will then spend several weeks calibrating them and getting them into place, before they start taking scientific readings.Once they\u0027re in, they will start taking what Nasa refers to the as the planet\u0027s pulse. It will do so using a\u0026nbspseismometer that picks up waves as they move through the interior of the planet, helping understand how active Mars is and what makes it that way.As well as taking the pulse, it will collect other vital signs: it will measure the planet\u0027s temperature. Using a heat flow probe, it will look at how hot Mars\u0027s insides are, allowing us to understand how similar it is to Earth and help explore how both planets came to be.And it will also watch the way the planet moves, tracking its slight wobble on its axis. Using very precise radio antennas, they will watch that movement, helping understand how it is affected by the sun.So far, we have studied Mars from afar and on the ground, with telescopes, satellites and landers. By sticking sensors underneath and inside of Mars, Nasa hopes to get an insight into a planet that could one day soon become home to people.“We’ve studied Mars from orbit and from the surface since 1965, learning about its weather, atmosphere, geology and surface chemistry,” said Lori Glaze, acting director of the Planetary Science Division in NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. “Now we finally will explore inside Mars and deepen our understanding of our terrestrial neighbour as NASA prepares to send human explorers deeper into the solar system.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Using a variety of instruments, it will delve into the inside of the Mars surface, burying underneath.Elon Musk renames ‘BFR’ rocket to ‘Starship’As it does, it will send back information about what the planet looks like underneath that famous, dusty red surface. Scientists hope to learn about not only Mars itself but also about other rocky planets in our own solar system – including Earth.The rover will land on the surface this evening, UK time. Nasa will livestream the proceedings, and they will be covered as they happen here on\u0026nbspThe Independent.That descent is not guaranteed, and comes amid concern and upset about the future of the Opportunity rover. There have been numerous failed missions to Mars: from the European Space Agency’s\u0026nbspSchiaparelli\u0026nbsplander, which smashed into the surface in 2016 at such speed it could not have survived, all the way back to the original Soviet missions in the 1970s which repeatedly failed.This time around, we’ll get to know if it’s successful straight away. That’s thanks to two little flying robots known as CubeSats – named WALL-E and EVE after the main characters in the 2008 animated film – which went to Mars on the same rocket that is carrying the new lander and will fly past the Red Planet, relaying messages about its progress to\u0026nbspground controllers nearly 100 million miles away.Once the lander arrives on Mars, it will sit stationary and begin its work, looking deep underneath the surface for clues about what is going on there. Using seismometers to measure the movement of the ground, and a heat probe to take its temperature, scientists will get their first look at what is happening deep in Mars – and hopefully provide some clues about how it formed and more.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Slowed by friction, deployment of a giant parachute and retro rockets, InSight will descend 77 miles through pink Martian skies to the surface in 6 12 minutes, traveling a mere 5 mph (8 kph) by the time it lands.The stationary probe, launched in May from California, will then pause for 16 minutes for the dust to settle, literally, around its landing site, before disc-shaped solar panels are unfurled like wings to provide power to the spacecraft.Latest as Nasa arrives on MarsThe mission control team at NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) near Los Angeles hopes to receive real-time confirmation of the craft\u0027s arrival from data relayed by a pair of miniature satellites that were launched along with InSight and will be flying past Mars.The JPL controllers also expect to receive a photograph of the probe\u0027s new surroundings on the flat, smooth Martian plain close to the planet\u0027s equator called the Elysium Planitia.The site is roughly 373 miles (600 km) from the 2012 landing spot of the car-sized Mars rover Curiosity, the last spacecraft sent to the Red Planet by NASA.The smaller, 880-pound (360 kg) InSight - its name is short for Interior Exploration Using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport - marks the 21st U.S.-launched Mars missions, dating back to the Mariner fly-bys of the 1960s. Nearly two dozen other Mars missions have been sent from other nations.InSight will spend 24 months - about one Martian year - using seismic monitoring and underground temperature readings to unlock mysteries about how Mars formed and, by extension, the origins of the Earth and other rocky planets of the inner solar system.While Earth\u0027s tectonics and other forces have erased most evidence of its early history, much of Mars - about one-third the size of Earth - is believed to have remained largely static, creating a geologic time machine for scientists.InSight\u0027s primary instrument is a French-built seismometer, designed to record the slightest vibrations from marsquakes and meteor impacts around the planet. The device, to be placed on the surface by the lander\u0027s robot arm, is so sensitive it can measure a seismic wave just one half the radius of a hydrogen atom.Scientists expect to see a dozen to 100 marsquakes during the mission, producing data to help them deduce the depth, density and composition of the planet\u0027s core, the rocky mantle surrounding it, and the outermost layer, the crust.The NASA Viking probes of the mid-1970s were equipped with seismometers, too, but they were bolted to the top of the landers, a design that proved largely ineffective.Apollo missions to the moon brought seismometers to the lunar surface as well. But InSight is expected to yield the first meaningful data on planetary seismic tremors beyond Earth.InSight also is fitted with a German-made drill to burrow as much as 16 feet (5 meters) underground, pulling behind it a rope-like thermal probe to measure heat flowing from inside the planet.Meanwhile, a radio transmitter will send back signals tracking Mars\u0027 subtle rotational wobble to reveal the size of the planet\u0027s core and possibly whether it remains molten.NASA officials say it will take two to three months for the main instruments to be deployed and put into operation.Additional reporting by ReutersShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Humanity only has a 40 per cent success rate getting to the Martian surface, where the harsh atmosphere and other difficulties mean landers crash and die more than they land and succeed.The landing came at the end of a seven-month trip from Earth. And it has been many years in the planning, marking a new interest in journeying to our closest planet and the first time Nasa has arrived on Mars in six years.Everything happens about noon pacific, 3pm eastern, or 8pm in the UK.\u0026nbspIf you\u0027re wanting to watch along, Nasa will be hosting live coverage on its TV channel. But you can also go to in-person events, which are happening in places such as Times Square and across the world. There\u0027s a full list of them on Nasa\u0027s website, here.Here\u0027s a little piece about the UK technology that\u0027s about to land on Mars, courtesy of Press Association:\u0026nbspAn American spacecraft carrying millions of pounds worth of UK technology is set to land on Mars on Monday night.The\u0026nbspInSight\u0026nbspprobe is due to touch down on the Red Planet at around 8pm GMT, slowing its speed from 12,500mph to a 5mph jogging pace in just seven minutes.It will then deploy instruments designed to probe beneath the Martian surface and collect information about the planet\u0027s deep structure.Three instruments designed and built in the UK are included in the spacecraft\u0027s seismic package, which will listen out for Marsquakes.Over the course of two years, scientists expect to detect between a dozen and 100 of the tremors, which could range up to six on the Richter scale.The UK Space Agency has invested £4 million in the probe\u0027s short period seismometer (SEIS-SP).Sensors for the instrument developed at Imperial College London and Oxford University can detect motion at sub-atomic scales.The UK team, led by Professor Tom Pike at Imperial, said: We should be listening for Marsquakes for at least two years, and we hope considerably longer.It is critical that we set down the instrument in the best place to ensure we\u0027re stable, and then follow up with adding a cover to shield our sensors from the wind.Colleague Dr Neil Bowles, from Oxford University\u0027s Department of Physics, said: The\u0026nbspInSight\u0026nbspSEIS-SP seismometer is one of the most sensitive and challenging instruments we have worked on for spaceflight in Oxford.Only around four in 10 missions ever sent to the Red Planet have been successful - and they have all been US spacecraft.The European spacecraft Schiaparelli smashed into the planet in 2016 after switching off its retro-rockets too early, scientists believe.It was testing the landing system for a British-built rover to be launched on the second phase of the ExoMars mission in 2020.The thin Martian atmosphere means there is hardly any friction to slow down spacecraft.InSight\u0026nbspwill rely on small rockets, parachutes, heat shields and shock-absorbing legs to manage the deceleration and ensure a soft landing on an equatorial region called Elysium Planitia.If successful, the three-legged probe will help scientists learn about how rocky worlds like the Earth and Moon formed more than 4.5 billion years ago.Lori Glaze, acting director of the Planetary Science Division at the American space agency Nasa, said: Once\u0026nbspInSight\u0026nbspis settled on the Red Planet and its instruments are deployed, it will start collecting valuable information about the structure of Mars\u0027 deep interior - information that will help us understand the formation and evolution of all rocky planets, including the one we call home.InSight\u0026nbspwas launched from California on May 5.The mission coincides with the discovery of a 12-mile lake of water beneath the southern Martian ice cap earlier this year.An orbiting European probe found the lake using ground-penetrating radar. The presence of a large body of liquid water on Mars has major implications for the chances of life surviving on the planet.The European ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), which is currently circling Mars, will be used to sniff any gases released by seismic events detected by\u0026nbspInSight.TGO scientist Dr Manesh Patel, from the Open University, said: This could potentially provide a way to unlock the secrets to what hides beneath the Martian surface.InSight\u0026nbspstands for Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport.And here\u0027s the latest from the ground\u0026nbspwhere everyone\u0027s a little anxious (via AP):\u0026nbspA NASA spacecraft is just a few hours away from landing on Mars.\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspInSight\u0026nbsplander is aiming for a Monday afternoon touchdown on what scientists and engineers hope will be a flat plain.\u0026nbspEveryone involved in the $1 billion international mission is understandably nervous. They say they\u0027ve had trouble sleeping, and their stomachs are churning.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s risky business to descend through the Martian atmosphere and land, even for the U.S., the only country to pull it off. It would be NASA\u0027s eighth landing on Mars.Again, just to re-iterate, this is very nervy stuff.\u0026nbspThe lander has to go from 12,300mph in just six minutes, all while ejecting a parachute, firing the engines that will keep it slow and flat, and attempting to ensure it lands somewhere on all its three legs. And it has to make sure it drops down somewhere reasonably comfortably, preferably flat and with few rocks.\u0026nbspWe\u0027ve not had great success at this. Only 40 per cent of attempts from Earth to land on Mars have succeeded.Nasa\u0027s TV\u0027s live coverage is, well, live! You can watch along here.\u0026nbspNone of the landing is happening yet, but it\u0027s got some great explanation of what\u0027s actually going on today.How will we know what\u0027s going on? Hopefully by receiving messages from two little cube satellites, named\u0026nbspWALL-E and EVE after the main characters in the 2008 animated film, which will be watching InSight as it drops to the surface. They should be able to send back signals near-instantly – but there\u0027s no guarantee the technology, which is still being tested out, will actually work.\u0026nbspIn the past\u0026nbspwe\u0027d get that real-time data from an orbiter, but we don\u0027t have that this time around. Instead, we\u0027ll be getting messages back from a different orbiter, as well as trying to watch it as it happens on Earth. But the former takes a long time and the latter is just snapshots.\u0026nbspAll of this will just be only to ensure that we know what\u0027s going on – it doesn\u0027t affect the mission. The lander can land itself.There\u0027s been some fear about dust storms. They\u0027re not an unknown event on Mars: the Opportunity rover appears to have been killed by one earlier this year.\u0026nbspBut it\u0027s probably OK: we know that everything is fairly calm at the moment, from orbiters that are going around Mars. And since it is so far away and conditions so unpredictable, InSight had to be built to ensure it could land in any conditions anyway.Please allow a moment for the live blog to load.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That was insensitive and ignorant. A deeply felt apology to all.”In the original post, the Aladdin writer was comparing using the word to using the phrase “anti-vax”.He wrote the message in reply to Julie Benson, a writer on TV series The 100, who was calling for her users to contribute to vaccination efforts.Johnny Depp ‘dropped’ from Pirates of the CaribbeanHe replied: “My heart goes out to all the parents of vaccine damaged children, who have to not only endure the sadness of their loss, but also the vitriol of ill-informed and insensitive people (such as those here). Anti-Vax is equivalent to calling someone a n****r and makes as little sense.” \u0026nbspAfter Benson replied asking Rossio to “...please never come on my feed with the N-word again,” Rossio replied: “Do you realise that you are using the equivalent of the ‘N-word’ in promoting memes that tag people as ‘anti-vax?’ Do you realize that the same collectivist stereotyping lies behind belittling any group with a label? Do you have no feelings for vaccine damaged kids and parents?“Twitter users immediately criticised Rossio for using the word, and said the comparison he made was shameful.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Ukrainian activists burn flares during their rally in front of the Russian Consulate in Kharkiv, Ukraine.

They are boycotting the dining room and refusing to eat\u0026nbspahead of an impending charter flight to Nigeria and Ghana, which is set to remove at least 10 residents from the UK.\u0026nbspOne woman taking part in the strike, who wished to be referred to only as Adesola, said some of the women had been in Britain for more than 20 years and had partners and children in the country.Women in Yarl\u0027s Wood go on hunger strike over \u0027inhumane\u0027 conditionsOpelo Kgari describes ongoing distress after release from Yarl\u0027s WoodLabour pledges to close down Yarl’s Wood and end \u0027hostile\u0027 environmentSpeaking from inside Yarl\u0027s\u0026nbspWood, she said: “A lot of people got married in this country.

But they will drag them. People have no rights at all, no dignity. They are going to drag them by force.”Adesola, who left Nigeria eight years ago after she was branded a “witch” by her husband’s family after he passed away, said she received poor legal advice when she arrived in Britain, which meant she didn’t initially apply for asylum, weakening\u0026nbspher claim.“My in-laws called me a witch because I lost my husband in 2010. He died and they blamed me. They said they were going to kill me. They took all my kids from me,” she said.“That’s why I came to the UK. I wanted to claim asylum,\u0026nbspbut the lawyer I saw when I came here gave me the wrong advice.

The only deal possible.”\u0026nbspHe added: “Those who think that by rejecting the deal that they would have a better deal will be disappointed in the first seconds after the rejection of this deal.”Outside the summit, pro-Remain activists took a blowtorch to a mock copy of the withdrawal agreement, before they were asked to stop by Belgian police.EU president Juncker says he would vote in favour of May’s Brexit dealEU leaders agree to back Theresa May’s Brexit dealTop ministers ‘plotting different Brexit’ if deal fails in CommonsTheresa May writes ‘letter to nation’ insisting Brexit agreement worksHigh Court to rule if Brexit vote ‘void’ amid Banks investigationSpeaking on the doorstep of the meeting, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said he did not expect MPs to reject the deal.“I don’t expect a ‘no’ vote. I expect a ‘yes’ vote and this is the deal on the table. I don’t think there’s anything more,” he said.Discussion about what to do in the event the deal was rejected was notable by its absence from the meeting, with one senior EU official saying there was “no appetite” for it after the gruelling slog to an agreement.“I don’t think there were any ‘what if’ questions asked to Theresa May today, quite a few were wishing her good luck,” they said.We don’t want to create the false impression for the UK that a better alternative deal is possibleIrish prime minister Leo Varadkar said: “We made the conscious decision as 27 not to speculate\u0026nbspon alternative scenarios.“We don’t want to create the false impression for the UK that a better alternative deal is possible.”Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz added: “It is important that everyone in the UK is aware of the fact that this agreement is the final result. It will definitely not be renegotiated and there will be no further leeway.”The European Council conclusions released after the meeting specifically thanked chief negotiator Michel Barnier “for his tireless efforts as the Union’s chief negotiator and for his contribution to maintaining the unity among EU27 member states throughout the negotiations”.\u0026nbspEU leaders met among\u0026nbspthemselves without Theresa May, and were then joined by the British prime minister to discuss the deal once they had signed it off.

The UK conceded in writing that Spain should have a veto over whether any future trade deal applies to Gibraltar – potentially storing up trouble down the road. Spain wants any future relationship governing the British overseas territory to be negotiated bilaterally between itself and the UK.Behind the scenes, officials in Brussels were delighted with the result, particularly the maintenance of EU unity in the face of British attempts to ide the bloc.“Many member states have had very particular concerns which are all legitimate, and there has been a willingness to accommodate,” one EU source said.“More fundamentally that says something about the nature of the union. The union stands up for its member states – like Spain, Ireland. This is the essence of the union. I would tend to borrow a slogan and say ‘Stronger In’.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles.

is it Norway, plus the single market, the customs union, which some of us have been arguing for for over two years?Mrs May responds: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom tempted to say to her that throughout the last 18 months of these negotiations at virtually every stage people have said to me it wasn\u0027t possible for me to negotiate a deal with the EU.\u0026ldquoNo sooner do I then people are saying \u0027well what\u0027s the next thing you\u0027re going to negotiate\u0027.4.10pm update: Corbyn claims continuing with deal is an act of national self harmThe Labour leader warns under the current deal, the UK would have to agree to demands on waters and quota shares to get a future trade deal or extend the transition period.\u0026nbspHe also claims the deal opened the door for Spain to have a role over Gibraltar.\u0026nbspThe Labour leader says:\u0026nbspIt\u0027s not in the national interest for the Prime Minister to plough on when it\u0027s clear this deal does not have the support of either side of this House or the country as a whole.Ploughing on is not stoic, it\u0027s an act of national self harm, instead of threatening this House with a no deal scenario of a no Brexit scenario the Prime Minister now needs to prepare a plan B.Theresa May responds saying the British people wanted control of our borders, they want an end to free movement and this deal delivers it.\u0026nbspReferencing Mr Corbyn\u0027s warnings over fishing and Gibraltar, she says: It\u0027s important to recall that if we were in the backstop we would be outside the Common Fisheries Policy and we would be deciding who has access to fish in our waters.He mentioned Gibraltar, I quoted the chief minister of Gibraltar who made very clear, as I did, that this Government stood by Gibraltar and we resisted changes to the Withdrawal Agreement which the Spanish government wished to make.4pm update: Corbyn goes on the attack against May\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn is quick to again attack Theresa May\u0027s agreed draft Breixt deal and the negotiations that led to it.\u0026nbspHe claims it fails to deliver on the Prime Minister\u0027s vow that it takes back control of the UK\u0027s borders, money and laws.\u0026nbspThe Labour leader says: The Prime Minister might want to sell yesterdays summit as a great success, but nothing has changed.The Prime Minister says if we reject this deal it takes us back to square one but the truth is under this government we have never got beyond square one.This botched deal is a bad deal for this country.Yesterday marked the end of miserable negotiations from the government.Even the Prime Minister\u0027s own government can\u0026rsquot bring themselves to sell this deal.Her Cabinet knows these negotiations have failed and will leave Britain worse off.The Prime Minister claims this deal takes back control of money and laws is a fallacy -

And does so in a way that also protects jobs, that also gives security to EU citizens.1.37pm update: Hard border on the island of Ireland cannot be avoided through goodwill and wishful thinking - Ireland\u0027s premierLeo Varadkar said the current draft Brexit deal on the table is the only way of preventing a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.The Taosieach said the heads of the 27 EU member states agreed not to speculate on a no-deal scenario, but he added that Ireland and the EU is making preparations for it.Speaking at a Project Ireland event in Dublin after returning from Brussels where the EU and the UK Government backed the draft withdrawal text, Mr Vardakar said it makes sense for everyone to agree to the current deal.He said: We need to be realistic here, there is no country in the EU that can be fully prepared for a cliff-edge, no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspTheir (British Parliament) decision on whether or not to accept the deal that had been negotiated by their government is a matter for their Parliament, so we don\u0027t want to be counter-productive by being seen to interfere with the of decisions of the British Parliament.You could imagine the reaction that might happen in Ireland if you had politicians from Spain or Britain or Denmark coming to Ireland and telling us how we should vote in a parliamentary vote.1.01pm update: Boris Johnson proposes NEW Brexit dealThe former foreign secretary and leading personality of the Leave campaign branded Mrs May\u0026rsquos deal a \u0026ldquodisaster for this country.Arguing it will keep Britain linked to the European Union for years to come, Mr Johnson said the best possible alternative to this agreement is to \u0026ldquobank what is sensible in it and chuck the rest.He wrote in the Daily : \u0026ldquoThe way out of this mess is clear.

With their first child due in early spring and most likely more to follow, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have been looking for a bigger nest to start a family and it appears that the Queen has come up with the perfect solution.They will move from Kensington Palace in London to Frogmore Cottage near Windsor.Windsor is a very special place for Their Royal Highnesses and they are grateful that their official residence will be on the estate, confirmed a spokesman for the couple, adding, however, that the Duke and Duchess\u0027s main office will continue to be based 20 miles away at Kensington Palace.This will mark a considerable step up on the property ladder for the couple \u0026ndash from the two bedroom Nottingham Cottage (where Harry is reported to have proposed to his then-actress girlfriend in the kitchen over a roast chicken dinner) to a Grade II-listed house on the Windsor Estate, where the couple married in May.                Royal SPLIT: Why are Meghan and Harry parting ways with Will and Kate?On the face of it the move seems sensible, given that Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland has moved to Britain and intends to be a hands-on granny \u0026ndash never mind the maternity nurse, nanny, live-in housekeeper, security and other assorted flunkies who may require on-site housing.Frogmore Cottage \u0026ndash something of a misnomer really \u0026ndash is thought to have up to 10 potential bedrooms, although at present the house is sub-ided to accommodate staff working for the Crown Estate.Like many couples, the race will be on to have the place shipshape by the time the baby arrives \u0026ndash or is it twins, as the bookies seem to think? But unlike most other couples much of the hefty cost of revamping the white-painted property will be borne by we the taxpayers, though Harry and Meghan will be responsible for any interior decorating bills.News of the move does, however, follow reports that William and Harry are keen to put more space between them and will soon be setting up separate courts.Although the brothers remain close, living within a stone\u0027s throw of each other cannot always be easy. And Kensington Palace has become something of a royal ghetto, with the Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, the Duke of Kent and Duke and Duchess of Gloucester all in the \u0027hood.A more incendiary reason for the move stems from rumours that Meghan and Kate have an increasingly strained and tricky relationship.\u0026lsquoDemanding and difficult\u0026rsquo Meghan Markle and Harry to move away from Kate and WilliamFrogmore where Harry and Meghan Markle will make their home (Image: nc)Meghan Markle does not always see eye to eye with Kate Middleton (Image: Getty)Now we must put ision aside for a better future - EXPRESS COMMENTWorld War 2 veteran\u0027s campaign to stop Brexit thrown out by EU courtAs one royal expert put it: Whereas in the old days Diana and Fergie got on famously, there is little common ground between Meghan and Kate. Both are fiercely protective of their husbands and their relationship is polite rather than close.Kate went to boarding schools in the UK and met her husband at university \u0026ndash therefore sharing mutual friends. But Meghan comes from an entirely different milieu with a background that is still shrouded in a certain amount of mystery.No one is suggesting that Meghan and Kate have fallen out but, equally, there are no signs that they spend much time in each other\u0027s company beyond official family gatherings. Indeed, the atmosphere between the Queen and Meghan seems warmer than the one between the Duchess of Cambridge and Duchess of Sussex. What\u0027s without doubt is that Kate has raised her game since the glamorous arrival on the royal scene of Meghan, the Hollywood star and UN ambassador with a track record of championing women\u0027s rights. She has gone out of her way to appear more regal, more composed and less gushing than her Californian sister-in-law.This is also reflected in her wardrobe. Not so long ago, Kate was happy to be seen in \u0026pound39.99 dresses from Zara now it\u0027s Alexander McQueen, Emilia Wickstead, Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana and Catherine Walker all the way.And it should not be forgotten that Kate has always been ambitious, a trait she inherited from her thrusting mother. Whether on the hockey pitch at Marlborough College or appearing in amateur dramatics at university, she has never been backward in coming forward.Kate Middleton has upped her style game since the arrival of Meghan (Image: Getty)So it has not been plain sailing for Kate to see new kid on the block Meghan being catapulted into stardom, walking regally down the nave of St George\u0027s Chapel and being greeted wherever she goes as the Royal Family\u0027s golden girl. William, too, has signalled how he wants to forge a role for himself that is different to that of his father or brother. In the BBC documentary leading up to Prince Charles\u0027s 70th birthday, he made a point of saying: I want to be my own man and take my own style, my own passions and my own interests and do things slightly different.Following the decommissioning of the Royal Yacht Britannia, the Duke of Edinburgh took it upon himself to furnish some of the rooms with items from the vessel and during the 1980s the house underwent an extensive \u0026pound2.5million restoration. This led to the discovery of a lost early 18th-century wall painting by Louis Laguerre which now has pride of place in the drawing room.Frogmore House is several sizes bigger than Frogmore Cottage and moving from the latter to the former at some point would be relatively painless for Harry and Meghan and their future children. The youngsters would have hundreds of acres in which to play and Harry and Meghan would end up with a bigger house than Anmer Hall, William and Kate\u0027s house in Norfolk.What Kate might think of such an arrangement is another matter.

S. Van der Merwe)The odd-looking animal which resembles a cross between a horse and a rhinoceros roamed Siberia, in northern Russia, tens of thousands of years ago until Earth became a much colder place. Scientists have known about the Siberian Unicorn, formally named the Elasmotherium sibiricum, for decades but thought the creature went extinct some 350,000 years ago, long before humans came to existence. Now, thanks to better radiocarbon-dating of fossils, scientists believe the Siberian Unicorn died out about 39,000 years ago, meaning it coexisted alongside early humans.The species, which is an ancestor of the modern-day rhinoceros, weighed about 3.5 tonnes, making the unicorn much bigger than its living relatives with the white rhinoceros being the heaviest at 2.3 tonnes.The beast was around two metres tall and four metres long.Scientists believe humans played little part in the Siberian Unicorn\u0027s extinction, but other factors made survival a challenge.One is that rhinos seem to always have low population numbers, and are not the planets\u0026rsquo greatest breeders.A bigger contributor is the Earth\u0026rsquos climate was particularly turbulent at the time, and the planet was gearing up for the peak of the Ice Age, which only ended about 11,500 years ago.Elasmotherium sibiricum was the inspiration behind the unicorn (Image: )Prof Adrian Lister, Merit Researcher at the Natural History Museum, said: \u0026ldquoThis megafaunal extinction event didn\u0027t really get going until about 40,000 years ago.\u0026ldquoSo Elasmotherium with its apparent extinction date of 100,000 years ago or more has not been considered as part of that same event.\u0026ldquoWe dated a few specimens - such as the beautiful complete skull we have at the Museum - and to our surprise they came in at less than 40,000 years old.The research was published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.

but the EU has warned that would render the mechanism pointless.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , thereported that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s Irish backstop after just three months.The paper claimed the hardline pitch to the Irish government “stunned” officials.Its claimed Mr Raab’s proposal was put to the Irelands deputy prime minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London.However, the Irish Prime Minister told Theresa May that he will not accept a Brexit deal which gives the UK the unilateral power to halt backstop arrangements for the border with Northern Ireland.The EU has suggested a backstop that would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union, the EU VAT system and parts of the single market.This will essentially draw a customs border down the middle of the Irish Sea, potentially damaging the union of the UK.Mrs May has suggested a backstop that will see all of the UK aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after .Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU thinks this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources.Brussels admitted in a draft trade agreement that technology COULD be used to solve the thorny issue of the border, using Max Fac solutions at the frontier as part of a future deal between the UK and EU.But the backstop - which keeps Britain in the customs unionno alternative is agreed to keep the Irish border open - will stay in the withdrawal agreement as an insurance policy.Ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith said: The withdrawal agreement will make it very clear that should we struggle with a negotiation for a free trade arrangement and not complete that process, we will fall into the Northern Ireland backstop.I would hope that she would now consider that none of this is at all workable unless we get the withdrawal agreement now amended so that any arrangements we make strip out that backstop.Former minister Owen Paterson added: As long as the backstop is in existence in a legally binding document, there is a danger that should talks fail the backstop becomes accepted.We would have the horror of falling into a customs union, the horror of having Northern Ireland separated from the rest of the United Kingdom.Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.On November , , the PM faced crunch Cabinet showdowns with her ministers where she will set out the details of the agreement she struck with Brussels the previous day.A number of pro-Brexit ministers are feared to be on the brink of walking out over the deal.They believe it would leave Britain tied to the EU customs union for years to come, because of the controversial Irish backstop arrangement.If the Cabinet does block Mrs Mays deal, she could find her position is untenable - leading to a Tory leadership crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000451029522.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"single mums on universal credit could jump the queue and get extra handouts amber rudd says","story":"The new Work and Pensions boss says she would review the five-week wait, payments for housing, and repayment of loans in a sure sign that more changes are on the way.But she said she wanted to focus on the impacts on particularly single mothers.In an interview with Sky News she said: Im going to specically look at how Universal Credit impacts women... Im going to make sure thatwe need to make changes to support them then we will.Research has shown that single mums and women generally are some of the hardest hit by the Universal Credit and welfare system.The flagship policy, which is set to roll six benefits into one, has been beset with issues, but the new DWP boss has vowed to fix them.She insisted that the system was a force for good but admitted there were real problems that needed to be dealt with.Millions more Brits are set to go onto the new system in the coming months, as ministers transfer people from the old to the new system.Yesterday MPs demanded it be put back while ministers fix the problems with the scheme as it stands.Influential politicians on the Work and Pensions Committee demanded extra payments for those transferring over, a scrapping of the five week wait for people already on benefits, and moves to try and transfer vulnerable people over automatically.Ms Rudd said she wanted to make sure women are protected and have access to split paymentsthey are in domestic abuse relationships.She said: We need to give [claimants] more confidence in the fact that they can access cash immediately.You know people are nervous about moving from legacy benefits to Universal Credit because they cannot afford quite often to be without cash for a few days, a week, two weeks, three weeks.I have to make sure that they can have confidence in access in earlier.Ms Rudd said in the Commons earlier this week she would talk to the Treasury about extra cash for the department.Chancellor Philip Hammond revealed a package of measures in last months Budget to help those on Universal Credit - with a multibillion pound programme.Brits will be able to keep £ of what they earn and will get help with extra payments and debt management, but those arent set to come in for years.Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.The current scheme is running five years behind schedule, and now wont cost any less than the old one.Brits have said it is pushing them into debt and some are struggling to survive - with one woman even saying she was forced to take £ for sex work while she waited.Yesterday a man who had his payments slashed said he was made to live on pasta and gravy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Securing a general election is the only thing that matters to them.Jeremy Corbyn is showing scant regard for statesmanship and putting our country’s best interests a poor second to sheer tribal and selfish ambition.I will tell you one thing about Theresa May: No one can say she is putting herself through this for personal political ambition.Hers has been a tormented week of continued public duty and personal, selfless service.Stoic and steadfast, the Prime Minister has shown a resilience seen rarely in politics, probably last admired when another woman ran the country.The stance of Arlene Foster’s DUP is carelessly irresponsible in the extreme.A lot of the “backstop” stuff and the — unacceptable in my view — possibility of the EU being able to block our exit, has been caused by a bona fide effort from May to accommodate the DUP’s wishes.For me, it has been an interesting week in another way as well.I have presided over the board meetings of several of the six private companies I have the honour to chair.Dferent sizes, dferent sectors, dferent parts of the country, yet they are all saying the same things. That business is doing fine. Not what the doomsayers want to hear, but true. It is hard work but certainly not Armageddon.Companies up and down the land are demanding a diet of “boring, stable predictability”. It means they can invest more cash and employ more people. It is uncertainty that kills us.I am hearing from boardrooms that the Brexit proposal is fine, with one big caveat.On the plus side, a Single Market for manufactured goods will work.Anyone selling into the EU — yes, even China and Trump’s USA — has to abide by EU regulation.“Taking it” from Berlin, er, Brussels in this area is not a problem whatever ideologues may say. It secures hundreds of thousands of jobs and tax revenues.The proposed deal means business will be free to recruit essential immigrant labour on the basis of their skill and not where they come from.Choosing from a global, not just an EU, pool of talent is so, so helpful and will assist our international competitiveness hugely.But the one message ringing through my ears is, “Get on with it.”Regardless of whether a business is in Birmingham or Barcelona, Sunderland or Stuttgart, the wealth-creators of Europe, the payers of the tax that builds schools and hospitals, the job-providers just want their politicians to stop this rowing now.Stop the bullying, Berlin stop the rowing, Tories stop the naked, tribal, selfish manoeuvring, Labour — and just do it.One big caveat: You cannot expect anyone in our country — businesswoman or a guy on the line alike — to accept a deal that gives Jean-Claude Juncker’s lot the final say on when, indeed,we leave. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his team have bullied us enough.While there are a million dferent beliefs on what the majority of Brits voted for in the referendum, one thing is certain: They DID vote to leave.Giving the EU the final yes no on that is unacceptable and surely no deal is better than that.No deal means no £billion to the unelected, unaccountable Eurocrats. No deal means fewer jobs in troubled Germany and faltering France.Yes, it would be harder for UK business for sure. But not fatal. There would be a price to pay, but whoever said freedom does not come at a price There was one other thing businesses were clear on at my meetings last week.The quicker this country understands there is a greater threat to prosperity, jobs, tax revenues and a successful economy than Brexit, the better.A Corbyn government would turn this country into Venezuela in short order talent and capital would leave so quickly that John McDonnell would have nothing left punitively to tax.The message from small business is as clear as it is strong.The Conservatives, Liberals, big business and the establishment must stop obsessing about Brexit and focus on the greatest threat this country has faced for decades.And that is a bunch of extreme hard-Left business-haters who would ruin this great country and probably blame their abject failure on Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No-one wants to see ato the hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.Instead, the EU’s real game is to try to prise Northern Ireland away from Great Britain, aligning its laws with the EU – a direct threat to the integrity of the UK.Scenting weakness, the EU is now threatening to exclude Gibraltar from a future trade deal.We are being blackmailed and bullied into a flawed deal. The EU has used the negotiations to stle the opportunities and optimism that fired people up to vote Leave in .In truth, there are risks in any course of action we take now. But, by far the gravest is to succumb to the EU’s terms, stay tethered to Brussels, and accept a deal that prevents us from becoming masters of our own destiny.Over the long term, that would drain the strength of our economy, when Brexit should be a boost for workers and consumers. And those who voted Leave would feel cheated, shredding trust in our democracy.Of course, the EU were never going to welcome Brexit. Some sour grapes were inevitable. That’s why we worked hard to leave on positive terms, extending the arm of friendship.In , the EU has taken every concession and gesture of goodwill as a chance to try to bully and control us – at times treating our Prime Minister, and our country, with outright disdain.We need to be honest about the situation: there are risks in a No Deal scenario.But, they can be mitigated and managed by the government -it exercises grip and demonstrates political will. So, let us steel ourselves, and reject this miserly deal.We should make our best final offer to Brussels, then ready ourselves to leave the EU on  March - whatever their response.That way, we can deliver on the verdict of the people, and grasp the opportunities of Brexit.

ago and now her son, , has fallen ill with the same condition.But his we, who genes were clear of the genetic mutation, also died from the disease, according to The Times.The woman, who was in her seventies when she died, was diagnosed with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease before medics linked the condition with her son.It wasn’t until her sons diagnosis they realised she contracted the usually inherited condition when she was pregnant.Doctors believe the woman almost certainly caught the disease from her baby through foetal cells carrying the same toxic proteins travelling through the placenta and into her body.The toxins then lodged themselves into her brain and began destroying its cells.Ausrine Areskeviciute, a researcher at the Danish Reference Centre for Prion Diseases in Copenhagen University Hospital, said: “We already know that when a woman is pregnant cells from the baby travel across the placenta and travel around her body, lodging in ious organs.“However, in this case the foetus carried the mutation for the misfolded proteins, and its cells may also have had misfolded proteins when they got into the mothers body, triggering the process that led to her death years later.”Her son is still alive, but as there are no treatments for the disease his prognosis isn’t known, Areskeviciute added.Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseaseis a rare and fatal condition that affects the brain.It causes brain damage that worsens rapidly over time, according to the NHS.Symptoms include memory loss loss of intellect changes in personality loss of balance and coordination slurred speech problems with vision and blindness abnormal jerking movements and progressive loss of brainand mobility.Most people who have the disease die within a year of diagnosis.It’s caused by abnormal proteins called prions, which accumulate at high levels and cause irreversible damage to the nerve cells in the brain.The prions are infectious, but cannot be treated like normal bacteria.They’re resistant to heat and radiation that normally kills bacteria as well as being resistant to antibiotics.Sporadic CJD disease is the most common type of the condition, but is still incredibly rare and

Blanca last year.Now, dissatisfied with how work is progressing, he has further damaged his fragile peace with the West by slamming the impact of US-led sanctions.It comes just days after he supervised North Koreas first weapons test in a year, trialling a high-tech tactical weapon.Visiting the beach resort in Wonsan, on the reclusive countrys east coast, Kim Jong-un called construction a decisive battle for the authority of his party.He said: The hostile forces are foolishly keen on vicious sanctions to stand in our way.Kim went on to say continuing construction of the Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourist area in such a dficult and tense situation would represent an on-target impact on hostile forces.He also demanded a number of new additions to the project, ordering more hotels and inns with over  floors as well as a large water park and an all-event stadium.The tubby tyrant added: They will be made to clearly see how our country has built its strength hundreds of times defying hardship.North Korea expert Markus Bell, of the University of Sheffield, said the resort would be of little benefit to most people living under the Kim regime.He said: Of course ordinary North Koreans are unlikely to ever be able to make use of such facilities.They are constructed as both a rest and relaxation destination for Korean Workers Party elites and as a magnet for foreign, specically Chinese, capital.”Chinese tourists account for roughly  per cent of all foreign visitors to the North, its estimated.Dr Bell added: Kim has promised two things to the North Korean people: a strong military and an improved economy.North Koreas recently acquired nuclear capabilities mean that Kim feels more secure than he did before and able to go ahead with projects like the beach resort.We shouldnt underestimate the symbolic value of these projects.They can be pointed to by the North Korean government and its supporters as signs that the young leader is set on making North Korea a normal state.North Koreas delegation to Spain reportedly travelled from Barcelona through Valencia to Alicante in June last year, looking for inspiration.Its was reported they were amazed by the dimensions of Benidorms towers and holiday parks.Work on the Wonsan-Kalma resort began in January and pictures from Kims visit show that the skeletons of its many hotels are largely complete.The dictator has demanded popular heroism and indomitable fighting spirit from his workers to ensure his deadline of October , , is met.Wonsan beach was the launch site for a failed missile test on March  last year, while the neighbouring airfield was used for a successful test two months later on May .The beach also hosted North Koreas largest-ever artillery drill in April , showcasing  large-calibre

And, on the Wednesday, Anne Hegerty attempted to get out of bed and every virtue-signaller in the country agreed she’d “opened up an important conversation about autism”.Which maybe she had, but that’s not really the reason anyone watches a light entertainment show, is it.I’m A Celeb’s pulling points, for me at least, have always been the peacocking C-list egos and spectacular arguments they bring.The only discernible tension on this year’s set, though, involved Declan “snap out of it” Donnelly who was becoming increasingly irritated by the molly-coddling approach of Holly Willoughby, who was either frowning vacantly, or squeaking with excitement, at the trials, where she’d tell absolutely everyone: “You’re doing brilliantly.” Even when they very obviously weren’t.Then Noel Edmonds appeared, in his toga, and the effect was electrying, not least on the other camp mates.The most obviously rattled was John Barrowman who, on day one, had claimed: “I’m OK with big personalities, ’cos I am a big personality.”An obvious lie. He clearly hates other big personalities and has never signed up for any TV project that wasn’t, in his own head, The John Barrowman Show.Within seconds of Noel’s arrival, he’d already made some mental calculations about his own profile, air-time and place in the grand scheme of things and clearly wasn’t liking the answers he was getting.Hell hasn’t exactly been unleashed since then, but Barrowman certainly wasn’t wrong in his calculations.

So for the good of the nation this house has little choice but to reject this terrible deal.In total  dferent MPs from six parties lined up to criticise Mrs May before the first friendly comment - more than an hour into the marathon Commons session.Perhaps the biggest blow came from Michael Fallon, the ex-Defence Secretary seen as a Tory loyalist who would support the deal.He asked: Are we not being asked to take a huge gamble here Is it really wise to trust the future of our economy to a pledge merely to use best endeavours As Mrs May embarked on her mission impossible:At a Brussels summit yesterday, Mr Macron suggested Britain could never get a trade deal without handing over control of our fishing waters to the EU.But today Mrs May said Europes leaders had repeatedly tried and failed to link the issue of trade to fishing rights.She added: It is no surprise some are already trying to lay down markers again for the future relationship, but they should be getting used to the answer by now - it is not going to happen.Speaking in the Commons, the PM also offered an olive branch to Brexiteers - insisting the UK wont stay closely tied to the EU for ever.Dozens of Tory MPs have vowed to oppose the withdrawal agreement because of the backstop which is meant to avoid a hard border in Ireland.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn: This deal is not a plan for Britain’s future.Tory challenger Boris Johnson: Its very hard to see how this deal can provide certainty to business or anyone .His brother Jo Johnson: Could I ask her to tell me which region of the United Kingdom will be more prosperous than under the present arrangements in the EU DUPs Sammy Wilson: Does the Prime Minister not recognise that she is handed the EU a cudgel which it will use to mug us Remain ringleader Dominic Grieve: How can we seriously say to people that the Northern Ireland backstop will not act as a fetter on our future freedom of action Veteran Brexiteer Bernard Jenkin: Can I say how sad I am that I cant support this deal Tory Remainer Anna Soubry: What is the Prime Ministers Plan B Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith: Does she recognise the genuine and real concern held on all sides of the House about what would happenthe UK was to be forced into the backstop Ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis: If the EU really intends in good faith to rapidly negotiate a future trade agreement why can we not make the second half of the £ billion conditional on delivering it Senior Labour MP Yvette Cooper: This isnt a deal for the future, its just a stopgap.Fervent Brexiteer Mark Francois: The House of Commons has never, ever surrendered to anybody and it wont start now.Former Defence Secretary Michael Fallon: Are we not being asked to take a huge gamble here Brexit-backing Labour centrist Frank Field: Does the Prime Minister accept that we can only leave the backstop with the permission of the other  EU countries, and therefore they are in the position to demand any ransom Tory pro-EU rebel Justine Greening: How can the Prime Minister reassure the house that this debate were about to have on her deal will be based on fact and evidence, and not more  promises to the British people Mrs May told Parliament the UK can quit the Irish backstop in future - evena future PM opts for a looser trade deal with Europe.She said: This is an insurance policy that no one wants to use.If we did choose the backstop, the legal text is clear that it should be temporary and that the Article  legal base cannot provide for a permanent relationship.Furthermore, as a result of the changes we have negotiated, the legal text is now also clear that once the backstop has been superseded, it shall cease to apply.Soa future Parliament decided to then move from an initially deep trade relationship to a looser one, the backstop could not .She admitted she is not entirely happy with the backstop - which is meant to take effectBritain and the EU fail to strike an alternative trade deal which keeps the border open.But Mrs May insisted: Put simply, there is no deal that comes without a backstop, and without a backstop there is no deal.The PM concluded: This deal honours the result of the referendum while providing a close economic and security relationship with our nearest neighbours and in so doing offers a brighter future for the British people outside of the EU.And I can say to the house with absolute certainty that there is not a better deal available. My fellow leaders were very clear on that themselves yesterday.There is a choice which this house will have to make.

I was really shell-shocked.”It seems like such a simple admission. But the reality is that with most celebrities, from the Kardashians to the Beckhams, projecting an unfeasibly perfect image of parenthood as part of their brand, many expectant mums think a new baby is going to be a walk in the park.The reality for most of us really couldn’t be further from the truth.Paloma also talked about the dficulty of balancing being a new mother with having a career.“I found it very dficult, the pull between wanting to be the greatest mother ever but also trying to sustain an inherently selfish career,” she said.The transition from being a woman with a career and all the time in the world to a mother wanting to continue working is no easy feat.There’s a period of adjustment and, often, the road is rocky. So here’s the reality, for what it’s worth.In my experience, EVERY woman who is a parent finds motherhood hard at some point or ­another, but especially at the beginning. And the women who seem to be sailing through it are often putting on a brave face, partly because they feel under pressure to do so.Often, people’s public portrayal of their le, including motherhood, is heavily edited, airbrushed and ­censored.The pressure on women for everything, including motherhood, to be “perfect” is clear.And,that isn’t your experience, with everyone  seemingly acing it, the pressure is on to pretend that it is.The vicious cycle is born. So it’s brave of Paloma to talk about her experience out loud.Given that every mum in the history of the universe has felt this way about motherhood at one time or another, we should be more honest about admitting it to be true.Modern pressures are making it so dficult I have to say I’m so glad I’m not raising a child today.The internet had still not been invented. The Twitter and Instagram inventors had probably not even been born.When I was growing up the only “influencers” in my le were my mum and dad.We ate as a family every night and there were three channels on the TV that all stopped airing by midnight. You had to make your own entertainment.Nowadays you can’t move for influencers on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter telling your kids how they should look or feel — and ­promoting lestyles that are simply unattainable.No wonder there has been such a dramatic rise in young people self-harming and taking anti- depressants. Too many influencers, who are hashtag “blessed”, don’t talk about the dficult stuff.Paloma, by the way, is raising her child as “gender neutral” — a ­decision that seems to be another indication of the pressures that ­people are under to do the right thing by their children.Too much choice and too much pressure to do the right thing and be the perfect parent can lead to paranoia.The best advice I could give a parent now that my own two are  and  is to find your own path.Don’t look too hard at what everyone  is doing.Don’t compare yourself to any other mothers, especially not celebrities with a team of personal trainers and chefs, and who snap back into shape two weeks after giving birth.Instead of aiming for perfect, just try to do your best.Listen, understand and give your child the one thing that really does matter: Self-esteem.Talk to other women, and be honest, evenyou are finding it hard. Because it IS bloody hard.So good for Paloma for being honest and fighting the tide of propaganda about motherhood.Because being honest makes it easier for other women who might be struggling.ISN’T it incredible to think that a hundred years ago, on November , , women were allowed to stand for parliament in the UK for the very first time Fast forward to the  General Election when  female MPs were elected.Yes, that’s in relation to  male MPs, so we still have a way to go – but look how far we have come.I know I am biased, but women are such a brilliant parliamentary asset.Look at all the things they bring to the table and to the conversation.Women are great listeners, good mediators, brilliant diplomats and inspiring promoters of family and equal rights. Oh, and we are resilient.Just look at Theresa May who, at a time when most men would be hiding under the duvet and emitting a high-pitched wailing noise, is rising to the unbelievable challenges being thrown at her by the Brexit process – and enjoying beans on toast with her husband Philip in the evening.Compare her to a politician such as Jacob Rees-Mogg who is doing everything he possibly can to promote himself and his political ambitions – rather than focusing on what the country needs.The PM is the living embodiment of resilience – a tough old bird indeed.ANYONE in a long-term marriage should take note of Dolly Parton’s insights on what makes her -year union work.“When people ask me what’s the key to my long marriage and lasting love, I always say, ‘Stay gone’,” the singer, reveals. “I travel a lot, but we really enjoy each other when we’re together and the little things we do.”Her husband Carl doesn’t like to appear in public or walk the red carpet – so she leaves him at home.Instead of glamorous date nights, they take trips in a “little camper”, go on picnics and eat at local restaurants, including a drive-thru McDonald’s.But eventhey are having a quiet night in, she says she always makes sure she is “fixed up for him because I don’t believe in going home and being a slouch”.You’ve got to love Dolly.NOT many people can ooze class, charm and elegance with their leg raised higher than their head – at the age of .Butthere’s one woman who can, it’s the glorious Darcey Bussell, who must be one of the nicest, and classiest, women in showbiz today.Goldman was one of the first corporate firms to introduce “lactation rooms” for women to express milk and it also runs free prenatal fitness classes at its office gym.It also has on-site day care where employees’ children are cared for  days per year for free.All of which is great – and let’s hope more companies follow suit for new parents.Mind you, it’s not like the need for childcare ever really stops – I still need an emergency nanny occasionally when my -year-old daughter loses her keys or my -year-old son locks himself out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In a study funded by anti-Brexit campaigners, the National Institute for Economic and Social Researchwarned the deal would leave the UK pound, per resident worse off. But Theresa May told MPs in the Commons: I am tempted to say this. I think it would be an interesting debate for this House - the extent to which economic forecasts can be described as facts.   It comes more than two years after her Cabinet colleague Michael Gove said the nation had had enough of experts. Asked when the PM stopped trusting forecasts, a No spokesman said: Im not sure thats the first time shes expressed some scepticism about some forecasts. The comments came despite the Treasury publishing modelling later this week on Mrs Mays deal. Just like the NIESR research, it will compare the deal to what would happenthe UK stayed in the EU. But a No spokesman claimed the two were completely dferent - because one is a forecast and the other is analysis. The Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May and the EU covers two areas: the Withdrawal Agreement, covering the UKs exit from the EU, and the Political Declaration on a Future Framework, which sets out the relationship with the EU after Britain leaves. Key details on the Brexit deal include: . The Withdrawal AgreementThe transition period can be extended until  - after the next election Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK A backstop could extend EU customs rules UK-wide - and wed need Brussels permission to quit European courts will still have a big hold on the UK. The Future FrameworkComprehensive arrangements that will create a free trade area - not exactly the frictionless trade hoped for Possible EU access to British fishing waters We would remain tied to European courts Wed respect human rights laws Visas needed for long term trips to the EU It has built in vagueness - kicking the can down the road for further negotiationsRead about the deal in more depth here.  The No spokesman said: Whats to be published this week is economic analysis. Weve always used the term economic analysis. I think its important that you report that correctly. Asked to confirm the Treasury will not be publishing a forecast, he replied: It will not, it will be analysis.

They seem to get a kick out of misleading the public. They think the public is stupid. Unfortunately for this breed, the public is not. The most infamous example is the Boris Johnson’s Brexit bus, claiming that leaving the EU would result in poundm a week for the NHS. Sir David Norgrove, the chair of the UK Statistics Authority, rightly chastised Johnson for his “clear misuse” of figures when the former Foreign Secretary repeated this patently absurd claim last year. This evening, I will present an award at the British Curry Awards, which used to be something of a Conservative haven. Today, as with last year, Tory Brexiteers won’t be able to show their faces without facing a barrage of criticism from the restaurateurs present.  One of the other  pledges in  was made by Priti Patel, who launched a ‘Save our curry houses’ campaign. She claimed that a Leave vote would mean more chefs and staff would be able to come over from Asia because of an end to freedom of movement from the EU. This is a particularly sensitive issue for the pound.bn curry industry. Figures y, but hundreds of Indian and Bangladeshi restaurants have shut down in recent years, with forecasts that % will go by . The main problem is not demand - the Spice Business magazine estimates that Brits will eat  million poppadoms this year. It is one of supply, with % of restaurants reporting an acute shortage of chefs and kitchen staff. This was the reason I backed the idea of a ‘vindaloo visa’ at last year’s awards. This would see strict one-year visas granted to Asian chefs, who would then train the next generation of curry cooks in what is incredibly sophisticated cuisine.  Theresa May was sent this -page proposal when she was Home Secretary, but has continued to ignore its merits. Patel’s campaign helped make sure that the majority of the curry industry voted for Brexit. But the promises have proved to be . Visas will remain incredibly dficult to obtain and the industry instead faces a problem hiring the front-of-house and assistant staff that they need - because these were roles so often filled by EU workers. Restaurateurs believe they have been betrayed and senior figures from the industry have told me that the majority would now vote remain. Theresa May’s lamentable ‘deal’ has done little to assuage their anger. The curry industry, like the rest of the nation, must be given the chance to vote on that deal, with the option of an exit from Brexit, now that it is clear they were so badly misled."},{"url":null,"title":"lets honest  its hard","story":"NewsopinionLets be honest – its hard not to pity poor plodder Theresa MayYou can always make yourself feel better by reminding yourself that at least you’re not herShareCommentsByPolly Hudson:,  NOV NewsopinionTheresa May is the new Kerry Katona\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWe’re all thinking it... and now it’s time to say it out loud. Theresa May is the new Kerry Katona. The most powerful person in the country, in the top job, has become the undisputed Queen of Schadenfreude. In a way, you could say that Mrs May is actually turning out to be a very inspiring leader. Every morning, however depressing and hard the day ahead of you might be, you can always make yourself feel better by reminding yourself that at least you’re not her. Her day will definitely be worse. Wherever she is, whatever she’s up to. Much, much worse. When you’re struggling to keep going, just think of her. If Theresa May can manage to even put one foot out of bed in the morning – never mind the other one, and then the rest of her – then there’s really no excuse for you not to. There’s also a good chance she’s making us nicer, as a nation, and more compassionate.  It’s a refreshing change to have a Prime Minister you feel sorry for, rather than actively despising, isn’t it  You’re not rooting for her, clearly... but you’re not quite fully rooting against her, either. She’s a Tory, – ie. inherently evil to the core with no redeeming features whatsoever – and yet rather than booing and hissing when you see her on the news, you can’t help but make the noise you wouldyou saw a puppy getting kicked. No, that’s not quite right actually... maybe more a snake getting stamped on. It’s not something you would want as a pet, but you still don’t like to see it being abused. The truth is, it is almost impossible not to desperately pity Theresa May at the moment. She worked hard to achieve an ambition, and then triumphantly succeeded, against all the odds... only for it to be an utterly miserable existence.  A poisoned chalice that doesn’t even have the decency to finish her off. The living embodiment of being careful what you wish for. Everyone hates everything she does. No-one is on her side, or in her corner. Her own party are the opposition just as much as the opposition. The criticism is relentless, and being fired from every angle. This poor, unfortunate woman, who is so into shoes, cannot put a foot right. But the most heartbreaking thing about Theresa May  She keeps going. Doggedly. She’s beaten down, broken. She’s aged over  years in the last three weeks alone, but she is determinedly keeping calm and carrying on. Her brave face never slips. She plods on regardless, grimacing as cheerfully as she can manage, teeth gritted, trying to make the best of what has turned out to be – understatement of the millennium – a bad job. There are worse role models. All this teaches us a valuable lesson. Whatever a person’s politics, or actions, may be, underneath they are still a human being, worthy of empathy, understanding and love. We need to remember that. It’s important. And then when Brexit goes through, and our country is ruined, we can get back to hating Theresa May, and her whole party again without exception, obviously. Bloody Tories – boo, hiss.

SHUT. UP.Im talking to you, Theresa May. And you, the BBC. And the new Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay who in his first public utterance on the matter managed to say a good deal that brings us the benefits of Brexit with a straight face. None of what theyre telling you is true. And theres another decade of this yet, folks.The two years weve just experienced of political chaos, resignations, backstabbing, bitchery and a total lack of political bandwidth for fixing all the things that are broken were NOT Brexit negotiations.They were negotiations about how we start negotiating. They were not the final hurdle before we leave, but the warm-up before we get in the starting blocks.  Everyone - Leave or Remain - who waves the -page transition agreement in the air and declares this is not what anyone voted for! is entirely right. What people voted for is still  years down the road. After the actual negotiations. Britain has done three things: . Voted for Brexit . Given notice that it will Brexit . Agreed what will happen while it discusses Brexit What it has not done, and is not about to do any time soon, is any actual Brexiting.  Barclay claimed in a newspaper article today the agreement is what people voted for in  - and that is what this government will deliver. With the best will in the world, hes talking bollocks. People voted to Leave or Remain, and neither is happening yet. And whatever is achieved at the end of all this, its likely going to be not this government, or the next, but the one after that which actually gets to deliver anything. Because as he very well knows, the next stage is sitting down with the EU to discuss what happens on trade, freedom of movement, visas, tarfs and the land border we share on the island of Ireland, and which most voters and politicians cheerfully forgot about until recently. Are you bored of the failed coups  The uncivil wrangling, the backbench blackmail, the -hour knee-jerk TV coverage of things that have not happened, are not happening and will not happen, but are being briefed to political hacks anyway  Well, youve most likely got another decade of it to go. Everyone who campaigned for Brexit knew this, and didnt tell you. Everyone who campaigned for Remain knew it too, and thought youd rather hear about World War Three. Had they only said that Nigel Farage would be resigning, leading, threatening, and resigning again for the rest of our natural lives, theres a chance we would have realised Brexit was a drawn-out torture that carried a serious risk of boring the nation to death. Theresa May has shown herself to be astonishingly resilient, able to shoulder dficult treaties over the line despite a dozen knives in her back. But not only do none of us want to see her struggle under that kind of pressure for many more years,she does struggle on everyone might just stop paying attention. We are already starting to tune out the greatest constitutional change in our letimes. There is a danger we will let politicians spiral into self-regarding spats, and cease voting while they cease trying to improve health, education, the high street, small business, homelessness, and every other thing thats in crisis.  When people disengage from politics, bad things happen. Communities that do so become distrustful, are trodden on, and riot. If a whole country does it, only the lunatics are left to vote and they usually choose the angriest halfwit they can find. Ask the USAyou dont believe me. But while we wait for that to unfold, we can appreciate those bits of Brexit that are simpler and within our grasp - a solid  years in which the English can legitimately despise the French, the Scots can threaten border raids and the Irish offer just about everyone outside for a fight. We can fall back on our tribalism, descend into sniping xenophobia, and talk about how its all bullying by the Germans, bloody Fritz, what they need is a good war, thatll show em. When you see that happening, remember this: thats how weve been dealing with Europe for , years. Its what we did after the Romans invaded, its what the Normans did after they invaded. Its what we did while we were in the EU, and its what well miss the most when andwe finally get around to leaving it.  Having promised unicorns, talked about unicorns and finally agreed a process by which we can discuss the delivery of unicorns, Parliament is now arguing about whether we shouldnt go back to the unicorn shop and ask for a dferent one. Its the one thing the Tories and Labour are united on - that Theresas agreement is so bad well never get a unicorn, and whats really needed after two years of argy-bargy is more argy-bargy about what well do while waiting for the unicorn to turn up. Its more than likely, when the postman fails to bring a horned magical creature before , that Europe will be blamed again. Frankly, we dont know how to blame anyone , and wed never blame ourselves. The only alternative to a decade of self-deception iswere all somehow forced, by Parliamentary process or a massive swing in public opinion, to think afresh about what we want our future to be.  If we vote to Leave under Theresas agreement, we retain the stability of being within the EU but without a rebate or voting rights. If we vote to Leave without a deal, the financial services sector is destroyed, tax revenues slump by billions of pounds, and Gideons austerity measures will look like a day at the beach. Andwe vote to Remain, wed just look like pillocks. Which is the thing all the politicians, reporters and campaigners seem to be most bothered about. If that is their main concern, doesnt that prove that the whole thing is a boring, worthless, exercise in futility  Only a pillock worries about what the French think. Lets just not be pillocks."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa insists brexit not trigger","story":"NewsTheresa May insists Brexit will not trigger Armageddon in the UKRejoice!ShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editorDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsLimited - - All\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheresa Mays official spokesman today insisted Brexit will not trigger Armageddon in the UK. The reassuring statement to the nation came as the Prime Minister briefed her Cabinet on No Deal plans - despite a pact being signed with the EU. Its widely expected to be defeated by MPs. Armageddon is a final cataclysmic battle pitting the church against the forces of Satan, the dragon, the beast and the  prophet, culminating with the second coming of Christ appearing on clouds of glory. It is, however, generally used to mean the end of the world. Yesterday, Theresa May boasted she was full of optimism about the future of our country.  Downing Street was forced to make the clarication after a leaked document warned clean drinking water could run out within days of a no-deal departure on March . Mrs Mays spokesman said today he would not comment on leaks - no pun intended, naturally. Asked about claims drinking water would run out, Mrs May’s spokesman said: “I don’t have any response other than ... obviously we’re making preparations to enure we are ready in the event of no-deal.” He added: “I’m very happy to rule out Armageddon again.” Theresa May has a Brexit deal, but the danger is looming that it will be defeated in the House of Commons. Even getting it past her Cabinet forced Esther McVey and Dominic Raab to resign. Now she faces one more hurdle - a vote in Parliament on December . MPs are grouped in several factions - their warring opinions are explained more fully here. But or more vote against the deal, they will defeat the deal. Against the deal TORY BREXITEERS: There are up to about , led by Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, threatening to vote down a deal that keeps Britain trapped in vassalage with Brussels. Not all are expected to live up to their threats. TORY HARD REMAINERS: Only about a dozen, but many - including Justine Greening and Jo Johnson - will vote against, instead wanting a second referendum. DUP: Theresa Mays Northern Irish allies - who she handed pound.bn - are -strong. They say they will vote down the deal. LABOUR LOYALISTS: About  MPs are consistently loyal to Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit. Theyll be told to vote against the deal because it doesnt meet Labours six tests. LABOUR REMAINERS: There are about  hard Remainer Labour MPs. Theyre likely to oppose the deal to avoid enabling a Brexit. OTHERS: The SNP , Lib Dems , Plaid Cymruand Greensare all likely to vote against. For the deal TORY LOYALISTS: Well over  are likely to vote with Theresa May, for the deal. Many have paid government jobs - so would have to quitthey oppose her. NERVOUS LABOUR: Some Labour MPs could BACK a deal - fearing otherwise Britain will be plunged into an even worse No Deal. There could be  or more. Caroline Flint is among them. Unknown LABOUR BREXITEERS: There are only about half a dozen. It was generally thought theyd side with Theresa May, but Kate Hoey MP broke ranks and said she could vote against. The briefing from Operation Yellowhammer, Whitehalls contingency plan, described how chemicals that make water safe to drink are imported but have a short shelf le. It said homes could “immediately face a shortage of drinking water and inability to flush toilets, cook, wash clothes or keep themselves clean”. It added: “Millions of people would not be able to go to work because office buildings, schools and other workplaces would need to close.” The warning is said to have been so shocking it convinced Cabinet Brexiteer Michael Gove to back Theresa Mays deal.  It comes as the PM launches a frantic two-week campaign to save her premiership as she begs MPs to back her – or plunge into a No Deal Brexit. EU leaders finally rubber-stamped the PMs plan for leaving the EU after  months yesterday at a -minute meeting in Brussels. More than  Tory and DUP MPs now warn they could block it in the Commons - enough to inflict a crushing defeat. Yet the Prime Minister staked her future on the pact as she refused to rule out resigning - or the government collapsing –it is defeated. And today she launches a campaign that will pit her own MPs against the British public - by warning they have a “duty” to back her deal “in the national interest”. MPs want Mrs May to reopen talks with Brusselsit is voted down. But EU chiefs declared her pact the “only deal possible” with “no plan B”. Early December: Theresa May tours UK with two-week campaign to sell her deal directly to the British public.  December: A vote in the House of Commons on the deal.  December: The last chance EU Council summit, where deal could come back for more negotiation.  December: Parliament rises for its Christmas break. Final or re-run vote by MPs must be held before now. If it fails there could be no deal, or a general election, or a second EU referendum.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.  December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - is supposed to end. But it could be extended by two more years.  January : If theres still no deal, under current plans a backstop would kick in. This could keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, until a proper agreement is reached, in exchange for keeping the Northern Ireland border open. Read the full guide to the timetable here. And Mrs May will tell the Commons today: “I can say with absolute certainty that there is not a better deal available. “There is a choice MPs will have to make. We can back this deal... or go back to square one. It would open the door to more ision and more uncertainty.” Jeremy Hunt underlined the high-stakes gamble by warning he could not rule out the government collapsingit loses the vote, expected between December -. “It’s not possible to rule out anything,” the Foreign Secretary said. “What all of us have to do is to say what do our constituents actually want in this situation  “And we have to work out what’s in the national interest.” "},{"url":null,"title":"top 10 most unreliable used","story":"NewsTop  most unreliable used cars revealed - and what is most likely to go wrongNew list based on warranty claims uncovers the ten most undependable second-hand motors you can buy on the market today - ranging from the Renault Clio, Seat Ibiza and Mini Cooper to the Vauxhall Astra, Peugeot  and Range Rover SportShareCommentsByFred Nathan:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsTop ten most unreliable second-hand cars have been revealed \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe ten most unreliable cars you can buy on the market today has been revealed. A new list of second-hand vehicles also shows their most common faults and when they become a problem for drivers across the UK. The findings are based on a number of key indicators, including the numbers of claims against faults and how much each car costs, report The Sun . A spokesman for Warranty Wise, who conducted the research, said: This data is derived from real cases and genuine warranty claims making it the most trustworthy information a used car buyer can get. “We are not suggesting, by any means, that these problems are guaranteed to occur, but it is the sole reason a warranty exists.” The most reliable brand is the Honda with a % reliability rating - while Seat is the least reliable with %. As can be seen in the following list, three Vauxhall models are deemed to be the most unreliable, while surprising entrants in the form of high end cars from Mercedes and Range Rover also are beset with issues. THE  MOST UNRELIABLE CARS . Renault Clio   The Clio is of the most common cars on UK roads - but it is still susceptible to big electrical faults and ignition coil problems. The most expensive common problem with the car is gearbox faults which on average cost pound to repair. . Fiat  The Fiat  is another very common car on UK roads, but is very prone to gearbox problems. The Italian car also suffers with problems arising from the suspension, electrical faults and also clutch faults.   Problems start to arise with car when it is close to eight years old. . Seat Ibiza The Spanish manufacturer is popular with motorists - but Warranty Wise say most common problem is with the engine and will cost motorists a huge pound.    Other common faults with the car include issues with the ignition coil, turbo faults and gearbox faults which all cost more than pound to repair. Normally problems start to pile up on Ibiza drivers when the car is nine years and three months old. . Mini Cooper The Mini Cooper is one of the UKs most iconic cars due to its association with the classic film The Italian Job - but they have a number of issues which do not come with mini repair costs. The most common problem with the Mini Cooper is a clutch fault which typically sets motorists back approximately pound.   But costly issues such gearbox or engine failures will set motorists back on average a whopping pound. To compound the woe, it normally takes just one-and-a-half years for the problems to pile up. . Mercedes-Benz C-class A Merc is an expensive car to buy, so unsurprisingly it isn’t a cheap car either to fix. The most common fault with the car is an electrical fault which costs on average pound to fix.   Other common problems include sensor faults, suspension faults, engine faults and problems with the alternator. But it does normally take close to a decade for the issues to surface. . Vauxhall Astra Despite being Vauxhalls second best selling model behind the Corsa in the UK - some of the most common faults will set you back a small fortune to repair. The most common warranty claim is for gearbox issues - which cost more than pound, to fix.   Another major problem with car is with engine faults normally costing around pound to repair - alongside electrical and clutch faults. It normally takes nine years and three months for problems to pile up. . Peugeot  French manufacturer Peugeot has a reputation for unreliability. The most common fault with the car includes engine problems, faults with cylinder head gasket, clutch faults, electrical faults and gearbox faults.   The priciest problem with Peugot is engine faults which on average cost owners pound. But it normally takes  years and two months for problems to pile up. . Vauxhall Insignia This is Vauxhall’s second entry to the list, a popular saloon car with families. Warranty Wise state the biggest problem with the vehicle comes down problems with the steering.   This usually costs around pound to repair but other common faults include engine faults and gearbox faults which typically cost more than pound, to fix. It normally takes seven years and seven months for problems to pile up. . Vauxhall Zafira Vauxhall makes yet another entry into the list - and the Zafira has been the subject of ious recalls due to fire fears that have been caused in the main by replacement parts. But the most common fault with the car is down to problems with the gearbox which on averages costs more than pound, to repair.   More common issues include clutch faults, problems with ignition coil, alternator and ious electrical faults. It normally takes  years and three months for the problems to develop. . Range Rover Sport A Range Rover Sport does not come cheap, so its unsurprising that the cars most common faults are expensive to fix. Warranty Wise claims the most common fault with the car is its suspension, which on average costs around pound to repair.   More common faults include problems with the alternator, brake faults, electrical faults and EGR Valve faults - and it usually takes around nine years for these problems to build up. For those reasons, it is one of the most unreliable cars on the market.

Russell Bishop, , is on trial for the second time for killing Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway after new forensic evidence came to light. The nine-year-old friends, dubbed the Babes in the Wood, were sexually assaulted and strangled in Wild Park in Brighton in October . Within three years, Bishop was convicted of abducting, sexually assaulting and trying to kill a seven-year-old girl at Devils Dyke on the South Downs, the Old Bailey has heard. Despite trying unsuccessfully to appeal against his conviction and discretionary le sentence, Bishop told the jury he was deeply ashamed of what he had done in .   Under cross-examination on Monday, he insisted he was not a paedophile but was just bloody angry at a hate campaign against him and thought I might as well do it. Prosecutor Brian Altman QC asked: This was all about revenge  The defendant replied: Partly. Mr Altman went on: So the attempted murder ofwas born out of revenge by virtue of the three years of the hate you and your family suffered  You are portraying yourself as a victim. This offence was all about sexual gratication and you are a paedophile  Bishop denied it.   Mr Altman continued: You enjoy controlling children and one aspect of your control of children, particularly girls, is sexual gratication. Bishop said: No, not in any way. The prosecutor asked: Why did you choose a young girl who was two years younger than the age of the two girls you were accused of murdering  Bishop said: It could have been anyone. Through the psychological trauma of the hate campaign and what everyone  was saying it came out in that behaviour. The defendant said he assaulted the girl to belittle and shame her because I was bloody angry at everyone - at her and everyone who had done that to me. Mr Altman asserted: This is all rubbish. This is all lies.   You attacked that young girl because you had a sexual interest in children. It had nothing to do with three years of hate but everything to do with Russell Bishop and your character, didnt it  There are very good reasons for what I also suggest are obvious and striking similarities between the two offences because the killer of those two girls in October  was the same person who attackedin . And that man is you. As he was being questioned about his sexual interest in children, Bishop became agitated and appealed to the trial judge. He said: Your honour. Is this legal  Is this correct  Mr Justice Sweeney told Bishop that it was, andit was not, he would stop it. Bishop denies murdering Nicola and Karen.

Jake Pulford, , was on the bus passing the Errigle Inn in Belfast when he spotted the unusual sight. The pet, thought to be a Shiba Inu, was standing on its back legs with its paws on a table outside. As it was left alone, it then looked around for its owner before putting its face in the glass and taking a sip. Mr Pulford brought out his mobile phone just at the right moment to catch the moment on camera. He claims the pet even dared to take several swigs - but made sure to check he wasnt going to get caught out beforehand.  Jake told the MailOnline: Were known for our drinking [here] so apparently that goes as far as animals as well. I just heard people laughing and looked out [the window] and saw the dog without its owner. It had a lead attached to the table it was at so clearly its owner had just walked into the pub and left it alone for a little bit and thats when it made its chance.  I was expecting it to recoil. I didnt think that dogs would like anything like that. But it seemed to be enjoying it. Amused Pulford shared his photos in a group chat with friends, who found it so funny they convinced him to share it online. He shared the pictures on Facebook with the comment: Spotted checking the coast is clear at a Belfast pub. The post has since been liked, shared and commented more than , times. While Mr Pulford has not tracked down the owner he claims he would tell him about his cheeky poochhe got the chance.  The software developer said: Im happy that other people have seen it. I didnt expect it to take off as much as it did. Its probably the most popular picture Ive ever taken. Im always on the lookout for little funny things but never on this level. It makes me want to take more pictures though. If I saw the owner and had the chance then Id probably tell him [what happened]. I always like to give credit for these sorts of things.

Harrop Fold High was deemed inadequate in all five inspection areas by the watchdog in a scathing report published today.The secondary school, which has  pupils, will now move out of local authority control and become an academy, reports the Manchester Evening News.An Ofsted inspection report reads: The school is failing its pupils. Signicant and wide-ranging weaknesses have developed over time. These require urgent improvement. Inspectors identied said there had been informal exclusion of pupils and deliberate misrecording of attendance. In , year  pupils rates of progress in English, mathematics, and science were in the lowest five per cent in the country.  Pupils are poorly prepared for their future lives as successful citizens in modern Britain, the report reads. Inspectors said pupils poor behaviour has led to disrupted teaching and learning in far too many classes. The progress of students is unacceptably weak, Ofsted chiefs added. The schools culture does not encourage pupils to behave well, the report said. This poor behaviour disrupts learning, the report adds. Parents, carers and pupils say there is bullying. The report said four inspectors scrutinised every element of the school. Leadership and management quality of teaching outcomes for pupils personal development, behaviour, and welfare and overall effectiveness were all deemed inadequate. Channel  TV programme Educating Greater Manchester captured le at the Little Hulton school. It painted a picture of a school that former head Drew Povey had transformed after being named one of the worst in the country.This summer, Harrop Fold was plunged into crisis when Mr Povey and three other members of staff were suspended. In September, Mr Povey announced on Twitter that he was leaving, claiming he was the victim of a personal vendetta, which Salford council has denied. The chair of governors resigned in October, followed two senior governors this month. An investigation was launched in July, which is still ongoing, into allegations that children were removed from the school register - a practice known as off-rolling. This could potentially give the impression that the school is performing better than it is,the children expected to do poorly academically are taken off the register. Mr Povey has insisted he has done nothing wrong. Parents and pupils demonstrated to get him re-instated. The Ofsted report reads: Over recent years, year  pupils have been deleted from the school roll shortly before the date of the Department for Educations annual census of schools each January, only to be readmitted at a later date. This type of action means that the examination results of pupils taken off roll temporarily do not appear in school performance tables.  The report adds: In addition, pupils safeguarding has been compromised by the inappropriate and informal exclusion of pupils and by the deliberate misrecording of attendance. There has been insufficient emphasis on particular risks and challenges that pupils may encounter - including drugs, kne crime and gangs. Pupils have not been taught in a sufficiently structured way about when informal ways of speaking and behaving are not appropriate. These failures mean that pupils are poorly prepared for their future lives as successful citizens in modern Britain. The report says schools records of pupils attendance have been inaccurate, in part because some pupils who have known to be absent have had their register mark deliberately changed so they appear as present. In addition, some pupils have gained their present mark and then left the school premises. Worrying issues such as these have meant the leaders and other staff have not known where some pupils are, putting them at risk, the report adds. Bad behaviour of pupils is highlighted as a major issue. There are far too many occasions when pupils stop concentrating, chat to each other or talk over the teacher or class discussion, the report adds. Some pupils prefer to use their mobile telephones in lessons rather than complete the work set. The number of pupils who do not attend lessons but choose to wander around the school is of particular concern. In September an interim head, Damian Owen, and a deputy were appointed. The Ofsted report says there has been limited time for them to respond to the challenges at the school.  The school is currently receiving signicant support from the council through additional staffing and consultants. The investigation launched in the summer is likely to conclude soon and its findings will be considered by a governing body from a school outside Salford. Potentially, the General Teaching Council could be alerted to any signicant findings. Salfords deputy mayor, Coun John Merry, said the Ofsted report made disturbing reading. The inspectors have identied unsafe historic practices at the school, along with poor performance and achievement, he added. Practices include the inappropriate, informal exclusion of pupils, deliberate mis-recording of attendance and weak practice in staff recruitment. This potentially compromised the safeguarding of pupils as leaders and staff have not been in a position to ensure that they are safe. I want to reassure parents that since the start of September the interim senior leadership team has stopped these practices. The Greater Manchester Learning Trust, which is providing the interim leadership, is committed to working alongside a new academy sponsor to provide stability and support for as long as is needed. I know there is a committed and hardworking team at Harrop Fold who want to do their very best for pupils. Ofsted says new approaches introduced in may aspects of school le arer having a real impact, eventhey are at an early stage. It is important that the whole community gets behind the changes and works to common goals. There has been a lot of speculation in the community about hidden agendas. I want to reaffirm that the school, governors, and local authority all want the same thing - for Harrop Fold pupils to be happy, safe, and achieve their best.

William Hannah, who was initially admitted to Salford Royal Hospital after being hit by a car, died several days after the mix-up. It is not knownthe incident played a part in his death. The -year-old, from Bolton, was admitted to the hospital after being hit by a car in September last year, reports the Manchester Evening News.He had suffered serious injuries, including a traumatic brain injury, as well as multiple fractures. Despite treatment, his condition continued to deteriorate and he was moved to the hospitals Critical Care Unit and placed on a ventilator. Mr Hannah then developed a lung infection. Doctors then decided to carry out an emergency procedure to try and clear his lungs and improve his breathing. But the trolley containing the bronchoscopy equipment had not been stocked up ahead of the procedure, a hospital investigation found.  A member of nursing staff was asked by the consultant to get some saline so the bronchial lavage - which sees a small amount of fluid put into the lungs before being removed - could go ahead. However, due to an error in communication and mislabeling of bottles, the doctor was handed a detergent mixture - used for cleaning equipment - instead, which was then used to wash out Mr Hannahs lungs. According to an internal investigation report by Salford Royal Hospital, carried out in the weeks after the grandad-of-threes death, when the mistake was discovered, a second thorough washout of the right lung was carried out. Over the next  hours, Mr Hannahs condition continued to worsen and he began to show symptoms of sepsis and cardiovascular collapse. He passed away on September , . Further testing is currently underway to find out whether the error contributed to Mr Hannahs death. An investigation is also being carried out by a coroner, with an inquest due to take place in February.The serious incident report by Salford NHS bosses concluded multiple factors led to the mistake.It read: Following investigation it was determined that the inadvertent instillation of the incorrect fluid into the patient’s lungs was caused by a number of human factors. These factors include - un-stocked trolley distraction by other le critical tasks lack of clear two-way communication no labelling of bottle inadequate staff training and lack of COSHH risk assessment. The clinical impact of the errors on the patient is unknown at this point therefore we have requested an independent toxicology report to support the pathology results and coronial inquest.  Mr Hannahs loved ones said they were shocked and angry and felt as though he had been let down. They have instructed law firm JMW to investigate further. Mr Hannahs daughter Lisa, , from Whitefield, said: This was an appalling and unbelievable mistake. Eddie Jones, head of clinical negligence at law firm JMW, added: This incident has been very traumatic for William’s family who have not only had to deal with his death but also these appalling circumstances. Their grief has been compounded by this terrible error and they understandably would like to know how something so shocking and avoidable could occur. Dr Pete Turkington, medical director at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, said new measures have since been introduced. He added: “We once again offer our deepest sympathies to William Hannah’s family for the loss of their much-loved family member. “We have carried out a comprehensive investigation examining thoroughly the care Mr Hannah received. We have since shared this information with his family. “The review of Mr Hannah’s care at Salford Royal highlighted that he did not receive the high standard of care we always pride ourselves on delivering and we apologise unreservedly to his family for this. “We have since introduced new measures to ensure something like this will not happen again. “We continue to work with the coroner to determine whether any failings by the trust caused or contributed to Mr Hannah’s death.

Budgeting for gts is important to the majority of parents, with  per cent admitting they have a financial plan in place to ensure they can afford to buy their children everything they want. However, a further eight in  admitted to overspending at Christmas – with one third even confessing to buying too many toys and ending up keeping some for the next birthday. Alice Winter, Category Manager of Toys and Games at eBay said, “We know how much time goes into finding that perfect present and this year, regardless of budget, we want to help people navigate our great selection of toys – from the latest LEGO set to the traditional and retro.” “Christmas is a critical time for toy sales, however we recognise that not all parents have big budgets to spend on gts, especially when they still have to factor in all the other costs associated with the holiday season.   On eBay you can get toys across the spectrum of value to suit everyone’s wallet.” When it comes to choosing what toys to buy, half of parents said ones which spark kid’s imagination motivates their decision most. More than four in  are concerned about the educational impact of toys on their children, while  per cent like choosing toys which they enjoyed playing with as a child. Parents also consider their children’s ‘creativity and artistic nature’ when choosing toys for Christmas, with  per cent saying this often motivates them to buy certain items. And while  per cent of parents say their children’s pester power has a ‘massive impact’ on their purchasing decisions, many are influenced by recommendations from others, and the popularity of TV shows and books. Whilst it’s all fun and games for the kids, six in  parents said they find decision-making about which toys to buy ‘stressful’.   Almost an entire day is spent planning, shopping and wrapping children’s Christmas presents, with parents spending on average . hours doing so in the lead up to the big day. Researchers found that parents will be purchasing an average of  toys ahead of Christmas morning– and are most likely to receive Lego, Disney themed merchandise and Star Wars toys. Indeed, half of all parents polled admitted they’d be wrapping a Lego set this year. Stats from eBay certainly show a trend in what children are set to receive this Christmas – as in September alone there were , searches for Lego, a further , searches for Scalextric and , people were looking at Playmobil. When it comes to purchases during the same month, top items sold were Uno , Scrabble , and Hama Beads . And across the whole year, eBay has seen a staggering million searches for toys in total.Go to eBay toysofchristmas for inspiration."},{"url":null,"title":"how smell stepmums perfume haunted","story":"NewsHow smell of stepmums perfume haunted boy, , for decades after sex abuseDaniel Dowling, now , was forced to have sex with his stepmother by his own dad - who wanted to \"cure” him from being gayShareByLiz Dunphy:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video exclusive-son-ex-mod-worker-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn -year-old boy who was forced to have sex with his stepmother is still haunted by the smell of her perfume decades on. Daniel Dowling, now , was made to have sex with his stepmum by his own dad in a twisted bid to “cure” him from being gay. Only a young boy, he was made to watch porn, take part in threesomes and play a sick game that involved taking clothes off.And when he refused to perform a sex act on his stepmother, his father, an ex-Ministry of Defence worker, tried to punch him. More than  years on, brave Daniel has seen his tormentors jailed after turning detective to prove the guilt of his dad Richard Dowling.But he remains haunted by the smell of his stepmum Annette Breakspears perfume, after being repeatedly abused by her. He is also reminded of his horric abuse whenever he comes across the board game Frustration, which the family had been playing when his father said they were going to try something dferent. Every time someone lost they had to take their clothes off, with Daniel later made to kiss and touch Breakspears breasts.“I was sexualised at such a young age that sex means nothing to me now, the young man told the Sunday Mirror.“The few positive memories of my childhood are tarnished by memories of the abuse.When I smell someone wearing her perfume, or see that board game in a shop or on TV, it brings the memories back.” Daniel was robbed of a normal childhood – replaced by a sordid existence which right-minded people will find hard to fathom. Warped Dowling was jailed for five years, while his ex-partner Breakspear got eight. They are  now but were  when the abuse began.  Legal reasons had prevented them from being identied - but they can finally be exposed after Daniel bravely waived his anonymity. “It was Dad’s job to protect me, he said. They stole my innocence and ruined my childhood. I can never get past that.” Daniel, who is gay but currently single, will never forget the day the abuse began. It was a Sunday afternoon. Dowling and Breakspear were playing Frustration with him at home in Bracknell, Berkshire. Fashion retail manager Daniel, who now lives in Surrey, recalled: “Dad told me we were going to try something dferent – to take our clothes off whenever someone lost.By the end of the game Annette was completely naked. “They instructed me to touch and kiss her breasts. Dad was encouraging me to do it so I thought it was okay. I think that night was a tester of how I’d react because intercourse started after that.” Daniel’s father had met former carer Breakspear through a lonely hearts ad after splitting from the lad’s mother.  During three years together, Breakspear stole Daniel’s virginity and abused him more than  times. Once, he was picked up by his dad from Scouts, taken home and told to “give Breakspear a goodnight kiss”. Daniel said: “I went into their room and she was handcuffed to the bed naked. “I gave her a kiss and went to leave but she asked me to touch her and to untie one of her hands. We had intercourse and Dad came and joined in.” Another time, he was made to view porn before his dad had oral sex with Annette and said: “That’s how you do it.” In another sickening incident Daniel was called in to find them naked and engaged in a sex act. Breakspear then had sex with Daniel. He said: “We’d watch porn in bed together and then we’d have threesomes. She’d instruct me on what to do. Sometimes when Dad wasn’t there she’d ask me into her room for fondling and intercourse.  “I was an only child and I spent a lot of time playing Lego but she’d come in and ask me to do things to her.” In a sickening attempt to explain his depravity in his trial at Reading Crown Court, Daniel’s father claimed he abused his son “to try and steer him in the right direction and not to go to the way of being gay, because there was like, sort of, tendencies for him to be gay”. He added: “All I ever wanted was for him to turn out the right way.” The abuse only stopped when Dowling and Breakspear split up around . He claimed he broke up with her because she told him she’d had sex with Daniel and his grandad on the same day. The teenager and his father moved to Weymouth, Dorset.But Daniel, then , was targeted by another paedophile. Police raided the pervert’s home and found naked pictures of Daniel. It was then, as he was being interviewed by a child psychologist, that Daniel revealed the years of abuse from his dad and stepmum. Dowling was quizzed but claimed his son was an “attention seeking” liar. Daniel believes Breakspear was not questioned and there were no arrests.  The despairing youngster later tried to kill himself. When the case finally came to trial in May this year it was claimed police treated him “shoddily” at his  video interview – and that one constable even mocked him. Daniel says it was left to him, some  years later, to finally get justice. On September , , he secretly recorded a phone conversation in which his father admitted the abuse. Two days later Daniel walked into Staines police station, Surrey, with the recording – and he said that this time the police took him seriously. He said: “I don’t knowtraining has improved orI was just unlucky the first time, but I would definitely encourage other victims of historic abuse to come forward and report it now.” Daniel’s dad admitted to police that he and Breakspear carried out “sordid and deplorable” abuse and that he felt ashamed and disgusted. In court he claimed the abuse was to prevent Daniel “turning gay”, to “protect him from paedophiles so he would know what was right and wrong” – and to educate him about how he should treat women.  He blamed his actions on “undiagnosed depression” and said he fell under the influence of Breakspear – who he labelled “a Jekyll and Hyde character”. Breakspear was found guilty of three counts of indecent assault. Dowling admitted one count of cruelty to a child and two counts relating to sexual offences involving a child. He was found not guilty of one count of indecent assault. Judge Maria Lamb told Dowling: “Your warped sense of right and wrong allowed him to be exploited by your then partner not just once but again and again. You’ve failed to protect him from the sexually predatory behaviour of your co-defendant. “The damage is incalculable. The abuse of trust is monstrous and the reality is that one of you was involved in active sexual abuse and the other connived at it.” The judge told Breakspear: “For your own perverted sexual gratication you initiated this boy into a world far beyond anything to which he should ever have had to be introduced at those tender years.” Daniel, who has not spoken to his father for over two years, said: “Dad threw me under the bus instead of admit his guilt. He is dead to me now.” Det Supt Fiona Grant, of Dorset Police, responded to criticism over the  video interview. Praising Daniel for his courage, she said: “The video met all necessary guidelines and was accepted as evidence during the trial at Reading. “We conducted multi-agency professionals meetings with regards to his ongoing safeguarding. “Dorset Police takes sexual assault extremely seriously. Do not suffer in silence, come forward and report it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate gerry mccann slam ridiculous","story":"NewsKate and Gerry McCann slam ridiculous theory about what happened to MaddieOperation Grange detectives and Portuguese police have reportedly again discussed the theory that Madeleine McCann wandered off in the middle of the nightShareByNeil Murphy:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsMadeleine McCann went missing from her parents holiday home in  \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMadeleine McCanns parents have hit back at insulting claims their daughter woke up and wandered out of their Portuguese apartment on the night she went missing. British cops investigating her disappearance are reportedly reexamining the theory she left the holiday home in Praia da Luz to look for her parents who were having a meal with friends nearby.Operation Grange detectives are again discussing this theory with cops in Portugal, it was claimed. It is just one of the two new Scotland Yard leads centres on the theory the then three-year-old left the apartment alone.It was previously speculated she was then ploughed down by a drink driver in  who then covered up the accident. Kate and Gerry McCann say the theory is ridiculous as heavy shutters in the bedroom where her children were sleeping would need to be opened by Maddie.A family source told the Sun : Kate and Gerry have always maintained that their daughter was abducted and simply didn’t get up and wander off to her fate.To suggest this is almost ridiculous. There were heavy shutters which would have been impossible for a small child to open. Kate McCann previously dismissed the theory outright in her  best-seller on her daughters dissapearance. “I have always found the third suggestion insulting to our intelligence”, she wrote.   “Obviously, the police are obliged to consider all possible scenarios but there was no doubt in our minds that Madeleine had not left the apartment on her own accord. Earlier this month, it was reported a further pound, had been granted for detectives towards the hunt for missing Maddie.The Home Office confirmed that it has allocated the money to allow Scotland Yard to continue its investigation until March.

Her Maj is one very organised lady – she asks her -plus members of staff what Christmas presents they want as early as March every year. But not everyone in the Royal household gets a personal gt from the Queen. In order to qualy, you have to have worked for her for more than a year. And they must choose what they want, with the most junior staff getting presents of up to pound, increasing year-on-year to a maximum of pound. A week before Christmas, staff gather to receive their gts from the Queen one-by-one in the State Apartments.  The tradition is that they then thank her, politely saying its exactly what they wanted without opening it – but they already know what it is as theyve already chosen it themselves. And the Queen has one particular shop she favours for presents – Harrods, of course. She has even been known to shut the plush department store for hours so she can properly peruse the aisles. But now she can do most of her shopping from the comfort of Buckingham Palace, thanks to the internet. As per Royal tradition, one hundredweight of coal is also given to “deserving and needy” people in Windsor at Christmas, although central heating means this accounts for less than  people today compared to around  in the early days of her reign. Handing out coal to poor people is not the only unusual festive tradition in the Royal family.  The Queen writes her Christmas cards earlier than the rest of us - normally during her stay in Balmoral during the summer. She and Prince Phillip send  Christmas cards to heads of state, leading politicians, Commonwealth leaders, friends and family. Phillip also sends another  of his own to the military, naval and civilian organisations with which he is associated. And a week or so before Christmas, those family members who have been invited to spend the holiday with the Queen and Prince Philip are told by the Crown Equerry in what order they are to arrive at Sandringham House and at exactly what time. Royal protocol being what it is, it’s all worked out according to precedence and seniority, with the most junior and least important arriving first. Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William and Prince Harry are always the last to turn up. They then form a “welcoming” committee for the Queen and Prince Philip.

John McMullan, , said he was shocked by the scores in a recent PIP assessment for his son Declan, , who is unable to move, talk, see or eat. Claiming he faced ignorant questioning, he said he feared what other disabled people might face during their assessments for the benefit, which is replacing Disability Living Allowance. Belfast Live reports that are neurological condition that means he is unable to control his movements despite being fully aware. He requires -hour care for the condition, which was triggered when his brain was starved from oxygen during an eight-minute cardiac arrest when he was .   When John recently received a letter informing him Declan must be reassessed for the new payment, he expected the change would be made without question. He explained: The form was very easy to fill in because Declan cant do anything other than blink. He is unable to move, talk, see or eat. Doctors told us to imagine being buried alive - that is what Locked-in syndrome is. But three weeks later, I received a phone call from an assessor to ask questions. John claimed the assessor, who wanted to see Declan face-to-face, displayed a total ignorance of his condition. He said: In my opinion, I supplied ample evidence of Declans disability but I doubt they actually understood what is on that paper. I dont think the people assessing are fit to be doing it. Declan achieved the full payment but John said he was shocked to see that he did not achieve full points for his daily living needs. He said: Declan cannot eat and is PEG fed yet the assessor only gave him  points out of  for the level of assistance he needs with eating and drinking. He cannot move at all, only blink, yet the assessor gave him just two out of eight points on whether he needs supervision or assistance managing his therapies. He got   for needing assistance making budgeting decisions and just   for needing support in social situations.   If a GP is telling the government somebody is sick, who is an assessor to question the doctors judgement  How can a PIP assessor be properly qualied to override those doctors  Declans team include occupational therapists, social workers, nurses, doctors, physiotherapists and psychiatrists. A PIP assessor cant be all of that. I knew Declan was never going to be turned down for PIP. It was just the stupidity of the process and the fact even he did not get full points. Declan is probably one of the most disabled people in Northern Ireland. How disabled do you have to be  John said he was convinced the assessors aimed to get as many people off disability benefit as possible and believed a bonus system made them sales people in reverse. Recalling the year and a half Declan spent in hospital following his cardiac arrest, John said they were devastated to be told he was in a borderline vegetative state.   But the family was delighted to realise he could communicate by blinking. One of the first things Declan told his parents was that he wanted to go home. John recalled: That is when our battles began. We had to fight to have the house sorted out for him and we had to take out a bank loan to buy an accessible vehicle as DLA was not available while he was in hospital. I had to fight for a generator to ensure Declan did not die during an electricity outage. And now PIP. How many times do severely disabled people need to be assessed  If professional people are providing professional evidence is that not good enough  When you are disabled, you dont need to prove you are this disabled. A Department for Communities spokesperson said: “The Department expects the highest standards from Capita, who deliver the PIP Assessment Service and they have to conform to a rigorous set of quality standards set down by the Department. Each disability assessor must have a minimum of two years post registration experience which must be fulfilled within an approved health profession and receive extensive training in line with DfC guidelines before they undertake PIP assessments. “Capita is committed to delivering a high quality and empathetic service for people applying for PIP. Its disability assessors are healthcare professionals with the required skills and knowledge to carry out PIP assessments across Northern Ireland. The PIP assessment looks at how iniduals are able to complete a number of key everyday activities. Within each activity there are a number of descriptors, each representing a ying level of ability to carry out the activity. Iniduals receive a point score for each activity, depending on how well they can carry them out and the help they need to do so which is based on the evidence provided and collected. The guidance which disability assessors and PIP case managers are expected to apply is set out in the PIP Assessment Guide. “A robust complaint process is in place for customers who are unhappy with the service provided by Capita which includes the opportunity to escalate a complaint to the Departmentthey feel it has not been satisfactorily resolved. “The terms and conditions of the contracts of employment for Disability Assessors are a matter for Capita and are not set by the Department. However, the Department understands that an annual quality incentive of pound, is wholly based on the Disability Assessor producing consistent high-quality reports on a timely basis and is not related in any way to decisions on entitlement to PIP. “Decisions on iniduals’ entitlement to PIP are made by the Department. Every claim is considered on an inidual basis, and decisions are made based on the available evidence and the relevant legislation. More people are being awarded PIP at the highest rate of benefit than under DLA.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince charles says grandchildren wear","story":"NewsPrince Charles says his grandchildren wear him out on visit to toddler groupCharles, who has three grandchildren and a fourth on the way, was pictured last week during rarely-seen intimate family moments as he played with themShareCommentsByTony JonesAbigail OLeary:,  NOV NewsCharles with Amelia Kerr and her  week old son Oliver during the opening of the Dorchester Community Church in Poundbury \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrince Charles has revealed his grandchildren wear him out on a visit to a church toddler group. Charles, who has three grandchildren and a fourth on the way was pictured last week during rarely-seen intimate family moments as he played with them. He was seen swinging them by their arms in the garden and letting William and Kates youngest, Prince Louis, grab his face playfully. The prince sympathised with mother Amelia Kerr, , as she cradled her baby boy when he visited the toddler and parent group at Dorchester Community Church, based in his model village of Poundbury in Dorset. Ms Kerr said later he looked down at her four-week-old son Oliver Morris and said: My grandchildren wear me out, I dont know how you do it.   The Duke of Cambridge has already said wants his father Charles to spend more time with his children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. Charles will soon be welcoming another member of his family as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting their first child next year. During his visit to the church, Charles met mother and son puppeteers Sharon, , and Adam Pinder, , who with other volunteers put on Christian-based shows for the local community with their Ministry of Puppets. Adam held up his puppet Bob for the prince while his mother worked a sheep toy. She said later: He askedwe do the voices but my husband Andrew tends to do them. We find that children and adults tend to enjoy the shows and we have fun putting them on. Charles visit marked the official opening of Dorchester Community Church - the first church in Poundbury - which moved from a site in Dorchester town centre to purpose built premises in the model village.   The prince spent time chatting to the mums in the busy toddler group and got a surprise when he was given a belated th birthday card by Courtney Critchell, , and her son Oliver Knight, aged one. He asked the little boy did you make it  and when Charles opened it to reveal hand prints from some of the children he said: Look at that, terric isnt it. The Reverend Roger Frapnell, pastor of the church, said: Were in bigger, newer, brighter facilities now which means we can do a lot more in the community and for the community, which is what we are here for. We want to be a church thats  . He said about the royal visit: I think he was pleasantly surprised by everything he saw. When people have a picture in their mind of church they probably arent expecting necessarily an all singing, all dancing brand new building thats light, bright, accessible.   Earlier Charles opened a nearby development for the elderly, Yarlington Melrose Court, which offers  self-contained apartments, for affordable rent and shared ownership, and provides an alternative to a care home, allowing residents to stay independent for longer. The prince visited Les Elfords one-bed flat in the building and joked about the food served, asking: You dont have to have baked beans all the time  The -year-old replied: Its very good food.

The Royal Family sit down at exactly pm on Christmas Eve open their presents in the red drawing room at Sandringham. That afternoon, the family members have to try and creep down and place their gts without being spotted.

Steph Sykes, , swapped being a couch potato and gorging on , calories a day - more than twice the daily limit - for healthy eating and exercise - and is now a size . The administrative assistant teamed up with her mum on a joint diet amid fears that st lb Steph would suffer a terrible fate. Mum Karen Sykes, , persuaded her to join a slimming class with her - where her daughter lost a staggering st lb. Steph has told how she feels like a completely dferent person and almost cant believe her new look when she gazes into the mirror.   The young woman, from Billingham, County Durham, said: “I’m st lb, wearing a size  now and I feel so dferent. “When I was a size , I could only get my clothes from one place online and I’d only leave the house to go to my mums, where Id also lie on the sofa. “Now, when I look in the mirror, I can’t believe it’s me. While admitting that she was always very overweight, Steph said her relationship with food became really toxic after her beloved dad, Alan Sykes, , died suddenly of an aortic aneurysm - a balloon-like bulge which can burst open, or rupture, and lead to bleeding inside the body - on Father’s Day in .   Left completely heartbroken, she recalled: “I was on holiday in Spain with my ex and had sent dad a message that morning, thanking him for how much he had done for me over the years and called him the best dad ever. “But that night, around pm, I got the biggest shock when my mum called saying hed died. It was such a shock and I felt broken. “I was always big. My mum was large and so was my dad, and all I’d really known myself as was a size . “Dads death was when I really started eating on my feelings, though, and my weight became out of control.”  Not working then and eating all the time, Steph barely left the house she shared with her now ex. She only left her bedroom to go to the bathroom, or to the kitchen for more food - stuffing down calorie-laden treats like crisps, biscuits, sweets and takeaways like pizza, curries and ready meals. Steph said: “I became a hermit. I was bored and unhappy and didn’t care what I looked like any more. “Le didn’t really feel worth living to me, so I thought, ‘Who cares that I’m so big ’  “My boyfriend didn’t seem to mind that I was letting myself get so large, so I kept eating and eating, only really going from my bed, to the kitchen to the sofa and the bathroom, apart from once a week, when I went to mums house, five minutes away, where I’d just lie on the sofa, too.” But, her sedentary lestyle - sleeping until pm, then gorging in front of Netflix - became a real concern to her mum, who also works as an administrative assistant. Desperate to help, Karen joined a local Slimming World class in April last year, hoping Steph might follow. Her gamble paid off when, impressed by her mums weight loss and surprised by the meals she could still eat on the programme, Steph joined her for her first class a month later.  Finally sticking to a diet plan and eating proper meals, she began having a yoghurt and two brunch bars for breakfast, salad for lunch and pasta with a fresh sauce for dinner - meaning her excess weight started falling off. By the following October, Steph, who was newly single, had already lost three stone. Now,  months after she first joined Slimming World, Steph is unrecognisable, after losing almost st. She said: “I feel like a completely dferent person.  “I can actually buy clothes in high street shops now and when I look in the mirror, I can’t believe it’s me.” But her tremendous weight loss has left her with a legacy from her fat years, in the form of a stone of unsightly excess skin around her body, which she is now desperate to shed. Steph said: “Through my hard work and determination I know I have achieved so much in my weight loss, but now I want to feel as amazing as I know I deserve to. “It’s everywhere, on my tummy, under my arms, my legs, my back.  “I’ve done all the hard work, but now I need to get rid of this skin to feel my transformation is complete.” But an abdominoplasty, or tummy-tuck, is seen as cosmetic surgery, which is not normally available on the NHS, so she is fundraising on GoFundMe to help meet the pound, cost of surgery. Steph, who shares her weight loss photos on Instagram to help others, said: “I want to be able to date again, and not have to explain why I have all this excess skin, it’s the one last thing left in my massive change. As well as the tummy tuck and bum lt, I need a boob job because I have so much excess skin there, as well as an arm lt too. And her mum is backing her all the way. Karen said: At her biggest, I was frightened for Steph. “I am overweight myself and we are a big family, but Steph was taking it to the next level. “She was getting bigger and bigger and I knew it was not going to end well.

Researches initially thought interbreeding between Neanderthals and other primitive cousins was rare - but have now discovered they lived in a world of debauchery. Analysis of Neanderthal DNA in modern East Asians and Europeans found our ancestors began to pour out of Africa and mingle with more species around , years ago Data from the , Genomes project - which has mapped the DNA of , people from around the world - suggests an environment of rampant promiscuity. It was a complex web of relationships in which iniduals had intercourse with members of their own group - and dferent early humans, or hominins. Speaking from the US, corresponding author Dr Joshua Schraiber said: I do think there was probably much more interbreeding than we initially suspected. Some of the fantastical aspect comes from a lack of clear definition of species in this case. It is always very hard to knowan extinct group constituted a dferent species or not. My guess is that any time two dferent human groups lived in the same place at the same time for a while, they probably had some sort of breeding contact. Love child of two species of prehistoric humans from , years ago found in Russian caveThe groundbreaking work published in Nature Ecology  Evolution backs the idea interbreeding in recent human history was widespread. Geneticist Dr Fabrizio Mafessoni, who was not involved in the study, said: The scenario of multiple episodes of modern-human-Neanderthal interbreeding fits with the emerging view of complex and frequent interactions between dferent hominin groups. Recent studies have found Denisovans, another extinct relative, had sex with Neanderthals and humans on numerous occasions. The Denisovan species was only discovered in southern Siberia a decade ago. They were genetically distinct from both Neanderthals and humans. There were at least three dferent human forms on Earth only , years ago - all having sex with each other. And there may have been more. When anatomically modern humans dispersed from Africa, they encountered Neanderthals in Europe and Asia. This left a signature in our genomes - with about two percent inherited from the Neanderthal. This DNA influences our immune system and the diseases we develop. Initially, it was thought only a single episode of interbreeding between modern humans and Neanderthals occurred. But East Asians have up to a fth more Neanderthal DNA compared to Europeans - suggesting the possibility of many encounters. So biologists Dr Schraiber and co author Dr Fernando Villanea, both of Temple University, Philadelphia, carried out a series of computer simulations to explore the theory. Using AIthey found the dferent patterns of DNA in modern humans is explained by numerous periods of interbreeding between Neanderthal, East Asian and European populations. Dr Schraiber said: These findings indicate a longer-term, more complex interaction between humans and Neanderthals than was previously appreciated.  Assuming some took place before non-Africans split up to colonise all of Eurasia, it must have started over , years ago, he said. But the more recent episodes could have been any time after that - up until the Neanderthals died out around , years ago. Evidence comes from samples such as an early human skull belonging to an inidual dubbed Oase  that was dug up in Romania in . Prof Schraiber said: It had recent Neanderthal ancestry. These fossils are about , to , years old - so at least some interbreeding must have been going on as recently as then. When humans left Africa its known they hybridised with Neanderthals as their DNA is widespread among us today - even though in relatively small amounts. Dr Schraiber said: This pattern of Neanderthal ancestry in modern human genomes was initially interpreted as evidence of a single period of interbreeding, occurring shortly after the out-of-Africa bottleneck. However, subsequent research showed Neanderthal ancestry is higher by about  to  per cent in modern East Asian iniduals relative to modern European iniduals. Neanderthals occupied a vast area of Asia and Europe at the time humans appeared out of Africa - so there would have been plenty of opportunities to fraternise.  But the researchers were unable to establish why the Chinese and other East Asians have more Neanderthal blood. Added Dr Schaiber: It could be just random chance that East Asians happened to mate slightly more with Neanderthals than Europeans. Direct proof of interbreeding between Neanderthals and Denisovans has recently been documented. Dr Mafessoni, of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany, who reviewed the study for the journal, said: We now know Denisovans interbred with other ancient hominins as well as modern humans on more than one occasion. In fact, Denisovans contributed at least twice to the modern human gene pool - leaving two distinct genetic components. Dr Mafessoni added: The presence of Neanderthal DNA fragments in the genomes of modern humans from Europe and East Asia indicates multiple episodes of interbreeding between Neanderthals and the ancestors of both populations.

Ky Furneaux, a former Hollywood stuntwoman, appeared on the Discovery Channels TV show Naked and Afraid in a two-hour episode, which ran in conjunction with the show Shark Week. Along with four other naked survivalists, Ms Furneaux and the team were taken to a barren island in the Bahamas without resources for their survival. And for food, the group ad to spear fish in one of the most shark-infested waters on earth. Even though there has been a recent spate of shark attacks in Australia and concern over the safety of the ocean Ms Furneaux thinks that sharks are misunderstood. The -year-old added that sharks show warning signs when they are likely to be a threat.  She told Daily Mail Australia: I think theyreamazing, I think theyre hugely misunderstood and I have been working to get more comfortable around them myself. Theyre like any animal, they have certain body language that you watch out for. The survivalist compared sharks to dogs and that it is easy to spot when the animal gets riled up. She said that like dogs, sharks could appear calm but when they feel a threat they show physical signs such as stfness and snarling. Ms Furneaux said: Sharks are very similar. When you see them in the ocean they move quite smoothly when they are not in predator mode. You see them cruising along... and theyre not threatening but then you can see when they start to go into hunt mode.  They do sort of puff up a little bit in their movements and become sharper and more erratic. You can tell that theyre getting excited by something. Ms Furneaux added that while filming Naked and Afraid she would know to be alert when more than three sharks would swim together as this demonstrated pack behaviour. So when trying to catch food for their survival the group had a few close calls with the sharks while fishing underwater. The group carried sticks while hunting and would use them to deter sharks from approaching - by tapping them on their sensitive snout.  She said: The only way we could eat was to spearfish. So obviously youve got a struggling fish in the water and that is one of the things that turns the sharks into predator mode. Ms Furneaux was invited to appear in the all star shark episode of Naked and Afraid after bracing alligators and venomous snakes in a previous episode. She is excited for the show to air in Australia so viewers can have a greater education about sharks.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed.

The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.

It will be deal or no deal.I wonrsquot pretend the deal is perfect.No-one gets everything they want in a negotiation ndash and wersquove had two years of tough negotiations with the EU.So the deal is a compromise.If between now and the final vote in Parliament we learn the deal does not deliver everything wersquove promised our fishing industry, Irsquoll not be able to support it.And the same goes for Northern Ireland.I need to be sure the so-called backstop plan does not threaten the integrity of the UK by creating fundamentally dferent, permanent arrangements for Northern Ireland.But Irsquom encouraged those risks have been avoided because itrsquos clear the arrangements focus on the specic circumstances in Northern Ireland ndash the need to honour the Belfast Agreement and maintain the fragile peace process, and to avoid a hard border with Ireland. One thing I am absolutely certain about is this: a no deal Brexit would be a disaster for Scotland and the whole of the UK.It would harm the economy, threaten jobs and damage peoplersquos standards of living. I will do everything I can to stop that happening.Irsquove been disappointed by the soap opera of cabinet resignations over the past few days and Irsquom dismayed that colleagues might yet try to force a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.That would be a huge distraction at the worst possible moment.It is time for MPs on all sides to recognise that the alternative to the deal we have negotiated is leaving the EU without a deal. I hope that nightmare prospect really focuses minds in the days ahead.There is nothing to stop the SNP and Labour backing the deal. It achieves key goals set out in their own Brexit plans, like protecting trade and citizensrsquo rights. However, to support their own political objectives, they currently plan to vote against the proposed agreement.Prime Minister Theresa May has shown resolve, determination and strength of character as we move towards the final, dficult stages of the Brexit process.

to campaign for a new high school in Hawick - ahead of both Galashiels and Selkirk.Westminster MP John Lamont and Holyrood MSP Rachael Hamilton have launched the campaign, which aims to bring about a new high school as soon as possible and unite the townrsquos politicians behind a united front.Scottish Borders Council launched a review of all educational facilities in the Borders in September , with a view to building new schools, assessing which schools may need to be merged or closed, and considering how appropriate current catchment areas are.Education bosses at the council are known to prefer an intergenerational model of education, such as the poundm campus at Jedburgh which will cater for - year olds and contain community spaces and a library.In April , Scottish Borders Council agreed to create inidualised plans for schools in Galashiels, Hawick, Peebles and Selkirk, and agreed to bring an update to the council in October.However, the update has so far failed to materialise leaving parents and students in the dark about the future of their school.John Lamont, who represents Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk in Westminster, said: ldquoHawick High School has had its fair share of publicity recently, but it is clear that hard working pupils and staff are being let down by a site which is simply not fit for purpose.ldquoThat is why I have joined with my colleague Rachael, to call on the townrsquos representatives to come together for the good of the town.ldquoGalashiels is already the front runner to get a new school, because the town and the community is united and has a clear plan.ldquoHawick is lucky to have very active local representatives who have already put in a lot of work in to securing a new school for the town.ldquoNow is the time for the community and for its representatives to come together to focus on delivering for Hawickrsquos pupils, teachers and parents.ldquoIf we argue amongst ourselves about details, the effect will be that Hawick is put to the back of the queue.Rachael Hamilton, who represents Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire in Holyrood, added: ldquoMaking a decision on a site would give pupils, teachers and parents a real boost.ldquoOther towns in the Borders have been fortunate to benefit from a new modern teaching and learning environment and Hawick is clearly in need of some investment.ldquoPolitical infighting wonrsquot help, clarity should be provided over such an important issue, this is about giving young people and future generations a place to be proud of.The townrsquos councillors have welcomed the intervention of the two politicians, and threw their weight behind the campaign.Councillor Stuart Marshall commented: ldquoI think itrsquos very important that all politicians, councillors and community leaders join forces to continue the campaign for a new high school.ldquoOf course funding such a project will be a major factor in whether we can deliver such a project, and itrsquos great that both our Westminster and Holyrood representatives in the area are throwing their weight behind such an initiative.ldquoLet us hope that between them they can come up with much of the finances required.Councillor Watson McAteer said: ldquoI am delighted that our local elected UK and Scottish Conservative politicians are throwing their weight and influence behind a new high school for Hawick.ldquoI am in complete agreement that politics should have no role in deciding the future of our children and by definition our town and the quicker this project is agreed by all the better.ldquoHawick High School has seen its fair share of problems and a new learning campus would go a long way to resolving existing and future problemsCouncillor David Paterson added: ldquoAll of the Hawick councillors are campaigning furiously to get a new high school for Hawick, and the councillors in other wards are shouting for their areas as well.ldquoIrsquod like John Lamont MP to encourage the Tory government to make more money available to the Scottish Government to make this into a reality.The proposals to create inidual plans for Galashiels, Hawick, Selkirk and Peebles came on the back of assessments of the four schools that found they all have what are described as major defects.The facilities at each school were graded from A to D, with A signying that the buildings are performing well and operating effectively and D indicating that the economic le of the facilities has expired and they are at risk of failure.The overall conditions of Galashiels Academy, Hawick High School and Selkirk High School were given C ratings, while Peebles High School was deemed to have a B, or good, rating."},{"url":null,"title":"devastated-family-pay-tribute-to-charity-that-helped-them-remember-their-beautiful-baby","story":"A FAMILY from Blyth Bridge wants to repay the kindness shown to them

mean Spark becomes a standalone part of this large independent supplier ndash operating from our offices in Selkirk, Edinburgh and Horsham offices, supplying our customers under the new parent

Council has published a belated update on its much-anticipated school estates review, and it reveals that Galashiels is the top priority to receive new investment, with Hawick second, Selkirk third and Peebles fourth.Education chiefs are recommending that councillors approve plans for a pound.m cross-generational campus in Galashiels, which would be due to open in .The plans would see , secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students,  primary school pupils and  nursery children educated across the campus, to be split between the new Langlee Primary School and a new building at either Scott Park or Netherdale.Although the cross-generational campus is the preferred model outlined by council officers, there would be a public consultation which would explore alternative options, which includes a new standalone secondary school building which would cost pound.m.The costs outlined in the report are currently indicative but would be confirmed once a detailed delivery strategy is drawn up.The report states: ldquoWhile both Galashiels and Hawick high schools are both classed as grade C in relation to their condition, Galashiels will require signicantly more financial investment on an element-by-element fabric basis in order to remain a fully ing asset with no impact on the delivery of the curriculum.ldquoIt is recommended therefore that Galashiels is the first priority for investment given the current condition and suitability of the existing school in relation to the rest of the estate.If the report is approved by councillors, Hawick would be the second town to receive investment in its school estates.As in Galashiels, council officers are recommending the construction of a cross-generational campus, due to open in , at a cost of pound.m.The campus would cater for  secondary school pupils,  additional support needs students, , primary school pupils and  nursery children.Again, the option to create either a cross-generational campus or just a stand-alone secondary school at a cost of pound.m would be discussed with Hawick residents.However, issues relating to flooding risk and available space have led to Hawick missing out on first priority place as council officers do not currently have a concrete plan for where any new campus would be sited.The report continues: ldquoThere are other complex issues within Hawick aside from questions of scale and accessibility, in particular with relation to flood risk.ldquoWhile the existing high school site in Hawick has been included within the options appraisal, it is noted that further detailed investigations are required regarding the currently proposed flood prevention works at this site and the nature of permissible development works which could render this and other adjacent town centre sites undevelopable for an education project of this scale.ldquoThe Hawick flood protection scheme will deliver protection to the town generally at a level commensurate with one in -year flood events.ldquoEarly advice is that any new school provision on the same site or at the same level would require to achieve, a higher level of protection commensurate with its classication as a strategic asset.ldquoIn addition, other sites are already identied within the local development plan in terms of business, mixed use or industrial zoning, and this could have a detrimental impact on the wider economic health of the townutilised for educational purposes and an analysis would therefore be required.Selkirk would be the third priority for new investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m cross-generational campus, potentially due to open in .As with the campus recommendations at Hawick and Galashiels, there would be a public consultation that would consider just building a replacement secondary school, at a cost of pound.mThe report states: ldquoFrom experience with the Jedburgh intergenerational campus model, it is considered appropriate that a three-to- campus option could be considered for the Selkirk cluster.ldquoThis could comprise all the schools within the town and potentially a partial inclusion of the rural schools within the cluster, as was suggested during the pre-consultations, with pupils from P and P transitioning to the campus.,params: .pushldquoPrevious consultation with the community has focused on secondary education. It is therefore proposed that further consultation is undertaken with the community, parents, pupils and staff to determine the preferred option in terms of educational model.ldquoThis will help develop a proposal to take forward to the next stage of the process. Discussions will also be progressed with the public, private and third sector regarding the potential for other services to share services and facilities.Peebles has been designated as the lowest priority for a new school but it would receive the largest investment, with council officers recommending a pound.m campus to be opened in .The alternative would be a new secondary school building at a cost of poundm.The report continues: ldquoPrimary and secondary schools within Peebles currently have limited capacity for increased roll numbers, which is the main concern in this location as opposed to issues of condition at Galashiels and Hawick.ldquoBoth Priorsford and Kingsland primary schools are operating at  per cent capacity and Peebles High School at  per cent capacity, and further work on projected roll figures is required.ldquoIt is recommended that any decision to build a new school or campus model must form part of an overall Scottish Borders Council masterplan for the town taking cognisance of projected housing developments, transport links, infrastructure, including flood risk, and the local development plan.The campus model is favoured by council officers and the elected administration as consolidating educational provision in one or two locations would allow the closure of disused school buildings and reduce annual running costs.The report will be presented at the next full council meeting, to be held next Thursday, November , and councillors will be asked to approve the priority and sequence of investments."},{"url":null,"title":"50k-boost-for-museum-from-festival-of-speed","story":"MORE than pound, has been donated to a Borders museum by organisers of the Goodwood Festival of Speed.And a

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

was needed in order to fund the stadium.However, the spectre of the stadium has also led to campaigns by anti-greyhound racing campaigners to stop it being built.Last year, Sirius Sport received

Association staff take seriously their duty to protect student interests, and we expect them to do so robustly and fairly.\"Earlier this year, an independent adviser to the Scottish Government on widening access argued the wearing of the red gown at St Andrews was elitist.Professor Peter Scott said at the time: \"A university such as St Andrews, that prides itself on its traditions, needs to take into account the fact that that might act as a bit of a put-off for certain applicants.\"Students there parade around in red gowns. That is probably not an image some people want to be associated with.

In his BBC interview Raab pointedly refused to endorse Theresa Mays mantra ldquono deal is better than a bad deal. And the Prime Minister is not saying that any more either. If no deal is out and the PMs Withdrawal Agreement is toast, it means Brexit is now seriously stalled. This opens the way for the entire process to be halted,an when parliament rejects the May deal emphatically and finally, as it must next month.Yet at the beginning of the week, it rather looked asTheresa May was going to succeed in delivering her Chequers-derived exit deal. So what happened  Two events led up to this important juncture: the failed ldquoDads Army coup and the publication of the Political Declaration.The vainglorious attempt by the European Research Group of hard Brexit Tory MPs, led by Jacob Rees Mogg, to organise a coup against the Prime Minister was a dismal failure. They failed to gather enough votes even for a leadership contest to be triggered. It exposed the entire hard Brexit faction of the Conservative Party to ridicule and underlined their own irrelevance. Strike one to Theresa May.Suddenly, the press started to feature more positive images of the PM: no longer the hapless, bumbling dancing queen but a serious politician doing her best, a stateswoman even. One Tory backbench supporter said her opponents were motivated by ldquomisogyny and many women appeared to agree. A YouGov Times polls showed that the PMs approval rating had risen  points in one week.But then came what was probably the crunch moment in the entire two and a half years of Brexit negotiations: the publication of the  page Political Declaration. This was supposed to outline Britainrsquos future trading relations with the EU after Brexit. It didnrsquot. The painful reality is that nothing has been agreed.To say that the document is woolly is an insult to sheep. It is a disingenuous confection of warm words, empty declarations and wishful thinking that no one could possibly take seriously. The only thing it really delivered was a surfeit of adjectives - ldquoambitious, broad, deep and flexible - without the slightest hint of how Mrs Mays ldquofrictionless trade deal could ever be achieved. It amounted, as the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon observed, to the release of a herd of unicorns.Theresa May insists that the PD outlines ldquoa unique trading relationship with the EU, but it does nothing of the kind. It promises: ldquoa free trade area as well as wider sectoral cooperation where it is in the mutual interest of both Parties. But the reality is that the mutual interests of the parties, the UK and the EU, are irreconcilably opposed, not least because of the PMrsquos red lines on immigration and the single market. At bottom, the Political Declaration only guarantees a Canada-style free trade agreement.The document makes clear that the EU will regard the UK as a ldquothird country, and that further participation by the UK in the single market involves: ldquorespecting the integrity of the Unionrsquos Single Market and the Customs Union and the inisibility of the four freedoms. If Britain accepts the common rules or ldquolevel playing field on trade and services, it has also to accept ldquothe integrity of the Unionrsquos legal order... including the role of the Court of Justice of the European Unionin the interpretation of Union law.This has been compared to the kind of control the old Soviet Union exercised over nominally autonomous republics like the Ukraine. Thats unfair: the EU is not a communist dictatorship. But it does look very like the current EU arrangement with Turkey, which is in the Customs Union for goods but not in the EU. This is because of Britains commitment to the Northern Irish backstop in the draft Withdrawal Agreement, which accompanies the Political Declaration.The backstop began le as an attempt to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland, but has ended up placing the UK in an intolerable position for a sovereign nation: having to accept laws over which it has no control. Dominic Raab is absolutely right. This is far worse than remaining in the European Union. Right now, the UK is fully represented, not just in the EU parliament and the Brussels commission, but as a member of the Council of Ministers, is part of the supreme decision-making body of the Union. This gives the UK an effective veto matters of vital national interest.Britain loses this power next March, when we leave the EU. Thereafter we will still have to accept EU laws during the transition period and throughout the backstop arrangement, which will continue unless and until there is a new frictionless trade deal negotiated. The Political Declaration made clear that there isnt the remotest sign of such a deal happening.In the backstop, Theresa May has agreed for the UK to remain in the Customs Unionand for Northern Ireland to remain largely in the single market. Worse still, Britain can only leave the backstop by mutual agreement with the EU, which gives Brussels an effective veto on Britainrsquos departure from it. As Dr Kirsty Hughes has pointed out, the transition backstop places the UK in the same subordinate position as Turkey, a country which is trying to enter the EU but has not met the relevant conditions. Britain will have a legal obligation to follow trading rules on which it has no say.Does Theresa May understand how the EU s  She says that Britain is restoring its ldquosovereignty in the Withdrawal Agreement. Yet the truth is, the UK never lost its sovereignty in the  years it was in the EU. This was stated clearly in paragraph . of the UK governments own White Paper in February . However, under the Withdrawal Agreement Britain really does stand to lose sovereignty, and become a country whose laws governing trade are set by a foreign entity.That  page document was a tightly-drafted legal text, written in a language accessible only to lawyers. Now the Political Declaration has, by its very vagueness, exposed Britains dilemma with crystal clarity: we are in danger of making a mistake of historic proportions. It is simply impossible to contemplate Britain agreeing to this, and no responsible national legislature should accept it. No longer is British sovereignty ldquopooled in the EU, it is effectively relinquished.I dont blame Brussels for this. They wish Britain well, but their priority has always been to protect the integrity of the European Single Market while avoiding a hard border in Ireland. The EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, simply stuck to his brief. Theresa May tied herself in linguistic contortions, trying to gain privileged access to the EU without being a member of it. That was never going to happen. Like M.C. Escherrsquos impossible staircase, the negotiations always ended up at the beginning.MPs must now help Dominic Raab to draw the obvious conclusion, revoke Article  and halt the process. Dead. Say no to no say."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8731597.jpg?type=article-full","title":"peoples-vote-gaining-traction-at-westminster-as-brexit-deal-secures-eu-backing","story":"This week, Labourrsquos Sir Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, and Stephen Gethins, the SNPrsquos Europe spokesman, are due to have private talks on their parties coming together to back the ldquobest alternative plan to what they regard as the Prime Ministerrsquos botched Brexit deal.

But, as with everything to do with Brexit, things might change.Speculation about Labour warming to a second referendum has been stoked by suggestions that John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, held talks with Tom Baldwin and Alastair Campbell, the former respective spin doctors to Ed Miliband and Tony Blair, who are now campaigning for a so-called Peoples Vote.The former Prime Minister told the Andrew Marr Show \"Its moving that way\", adding: \" I would be really surprisedthe Labour Party doesnt end up in the position of supporting another vote because theres no other proposition that can get through Parliament.\"Read more:France would use fishing demands as leverage in post-Brexit trade talksMeanwhile, it is suggested five Remainer ministers - David Lidington, Philip Hammond, Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Gauke - have agreed to try to get Mrs May to adopt a softer Brexit, involving a permanent customs partnership with the EU,she fails to get her current proposal through the Commons.Meanwhile on Tuesday, judges at the European Court of Justice will rule on a case brought by politicians across dferent parties as to whether or not the UK Government could unilaterally end the Article  process and keep Britain in the EU.If they rule that it can, then this option could become the key alternative to Mrs Mayrsquos rejected plan it would mean MPs and not the public voting to keep Britain in the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-back-my-brexit-deal-brussels-wont-offer-a-better-one","story":"The Prime Ministerrsquos bold declaration comes after Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission President, sought to put his own pressure on MPs by saying that the UK-EU agreement on Brexit was the ldquoonly deal possible.The European Commission President cautioned: ldquoThose who think by rejecting the deal that they would have a better one will be disappointed in the first seconds after the rejection of this deal.\"EU leaders also emphasised the point with the Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar declaring: \"There isnt a Plan B.

I feel this is a bit of a punishment from the aftermath of the Fringe.ldquoSome of them looked a bit out of control.ldquoWe have always had a big focus on safety and we run tours with absolute control.Mr Feeney said the tours are organised to focus on the Royal Mile and Princes Street, and there is one guide per  people.People from the ages of five years old to  have taken part, including many Edinburgh residents.He added: ldquoI did worry during the Fringe period that some of the other groups would get us all in trouble.ldquoI do feel there should be standards across the board, and Irsquove contacted the council.ldquoI thinkthey look at the way we operate they will be pleasantly surprised.ldquoIt would be a huge shame for the citythere was a ban.ldquoWe are completely aligned with some of the concerns raised.In , the Swiss city of Lausanne banned outdoor silent discos due to noise complaints.Local politicians have written to the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government in order to update lawmakers on the issue.Councillor Mowatt feels there may be existing legislation available to use, it is just a case of finding it.She added: ldquoI am always wary of introducing new legislation.ldquoI feel there may be something in the legislation box already at our disposal and I think we need to double our efforts to seethere is something that already exists which we can use.ldquoTherersquos not a lot we can do at the moment in the never-never land of licensing.ldquoThe current legislation does not serve the residents of the city who never get a break from activity such as this."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9095065.jpg?type=article-full","title":"calls-for-scottish-government-to-create-fund-to-aid-businesses-post-brexit","story":"The Federation of Small Businessesin Scotland made the plea ahead of Finance Secretary Derek Mackay setting out his Budget to Holyrood on December .:Independence is now the only option for Scotland says Ian BlackfordThe FSB is also pressing Mr Mackay to commit pound million to helping Scotlands town centres, to adapt the governments existing rates relief scheme to help more businesses, and to reject calls from local councils to bring in a Tourism Tax, which would impose a levy on the cost of hotel rooms.With Brexit looming, FSBs Scotland policy chair Andrew McRae said the \"top priority\" for business north of the border was \"avoiding a chaotic no-deal, no-transition Brexit\".But he added: \"The fact we need a deal doesnt mean that Scottish firms welcome every dot and comma in the current proposals.\":Theresa May: Back my Brexit deal, Brussels wont offer a better oneMr McRae called on the UK Government to \"pay Scotlands business community greater heed\" when considering key issues, such as designing a new immigration system for when the country leaves the European Union.The Scottish Government meanwhile was urged to follow the example of Wales, where ministers have announced a pound million EU Transition Fund to help businesses.In his letter to the Finance Secretary, Mr McRae said \"additional support\" could be required by firms to help them adapt to the reality of post-Brexit Britain.He said: \"In particular, smaller firms may need financial assistance to enable them to make necessary adjustments, whether accessing technical or expert information on trading, dealing with increased or dferent bureaucracy, or addressing skills or staffing issues.\"We therefore submit that the Scottish Government should establish a Brexit resilience fund, similar to that introduced in Wales.\"He made the plea after FSB research found \"only a minority of Scottish businesses have started to prepare for Brexit\".Mr McRae added: \"While few would blame firms when they still dont know exactly what theyre preparing for, we cant see good businesses overwhelmed by a rapidly changing trading environment.\"Calling for pound million to be put into a new Town Centre Diversication Fund, he said: \"The high street is known as the home of independent retail.

Albaredahope readers will Make Someones Day on St Andrews Day on November  and to then celebrate our art and culture on Fair Saturday on December  to help raise funds for good causes. Well, thanks to a new campaign by the Scottish Government, we don’t have to imagine the outcome.For that dream will become a reality on November , with people across the country being asked to commit to doing something nice for someone  on St Andrew’s Day.The Maake Someone’s Day initiative aims to celebrate our generous nature.On Saturday, December , we’re also being invited to take part in the first Fair Saturday here, a celebraion of art and culture while raising funds and awareness for charities.A helping hand...making someones day need not cost a penny. Why not pop in on an elderly relative or neighbour and make their day Founded in Spain in  to combat Black Friday’s commercialism, it is now a global movement.But Scotland is the first nation to sign up as a whole.Ben Macpherson, Minister for Europe, Migration and International Development, was delighted to launch the initiative.He said: “This St Andrew’s Day presents an inspiring opportunity for people in Scotland, in all our ersity, to celebrate the inclusive, outward-looking and compassionate spirit of our nation – by helping others and showing our generosity.Pause for thought...consider buying a homeless person a hot meal or drink to help make their St Andrews Day.“We can all show the best of what it means to be Scottish by each doing something small to #MakeSomeonesDay. “If each of us does something kind for someone , together we can make a hugely positive impact.“We wanted our national day to act as a focal point to showcase the Scots’ generous spirit and nature.data-src\"https:images.johnstonpress jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Missing teenager Liam Smith\"  Liam Smith: Search widens viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"“This is not about how much you can spend it’s about little acts of kindness that mean so much more.“We’re asking people to make time for elderly neighbours, donate goods to charity shops, hold a charity bake sale at work, volunteer time to a good cause or gt a meal or hot drink to a homeless person.“Everyone can get involved – all you have to do is make someone’s day.”The initiative is tied in with Fair Saturday which next year will take place on St Andrew’s Day itself.Ben added: “We’re linking in with the event this year so we can build up to having a major celebration in .“Fair Saturday gives communities across the country a chance, through arts and culture, to celebrate what it means to be Scottish in the st century.“We live in a multiculural and erse society and we want to celebrate that.“Fair Saturday offers the perfect  to do that.”First staged in Bilbao in , the Fair Saturday movement is spearheaded by social entrepreneur Jordi Albareda.It has since been adopted by Malaga, Santander and Huelva in Spain, Milan and Pisa in Italy, Lima in Peru and Bristol in England.However, Scotland is the first nation to sign up.Jordi said: “When we began the Fair Saturday movement, we wanted countries all over the world to embrace its ideals of creating social impact through arts and culture. “It is fitting that Scotland is hosting the first nationwide Fair Saturday festival outside of Spain.“Scotland is a nation that focuses on ersity, multiculturalism, social empathy, kindness and, of course, arts and culture. “So it made complete sense for us to deliver the movement here. It is the most vibrant case of Fair Saturday to date.“In a time of building walls, we want to build bridges to connect people, cities, communities and cultures. “Millions of people working together surely must be stronger than some irresponsible global leaders.“We hope the Scottish people will mobilise behind our aim of creating a better future for all.”Some  events have already been organised in  cities and towns across Scotland on Fair Saturday, December .And the movement will also be celebrated in more than  locations globally.Jordi said: “More than  cultural events with a social impact will be taking place around the world.“Could you imagine the day when millions of people take part  It would send such a powerful message – that’s our aim for the future.”Fair Saturday aims to make people reflect on how arts and culture and social causes contribute to society. So all its events support a social cause of their choice in one of three ways:By recognising the charity’s workBy allowing the charity to spread its message to a wider audienceBy contributing to the charity’s work via ticket sales and donations.November  and December  in Scotland will also serve as a perfect antidote to Black Friday’s commercialism, which initially prompted Fair Saturday’s launch.Jordi added: “We connected with the Scottish Government thanks to our British Council in Bilbao in late  and are delighted to launch our first Fair Saturday here this year.“We believe it is one of the best nations in the world in which to start the journey. “Scotland’s National Day is all about sharing, giving and being kind. That tells you a lot about its people.”Visit www.scotland.org events st-andrews-day makesomeonesday to find out more or share your good deed at #MakeSomeonesDay.Fair fight back against Black FridayFair Saturday aims to mobilise people through social empathy rather than commercialisim – being staged the day after Black Friday to make that point.Jordi Albareda, its founder, convinced  choirs to perform in Bilbao, Spain, on November , , in dferent locations around the city at the same time. The result was incredible more than  people attended, raising more than  Euros for social causes.Since then, the movement has continued to grow, with more cities, cultural and social organisations and supporters joining along the way.Jordi said: “We are living in a material world. It prevails over humanity. “The strong desire of having has taken over from the profound aspiration of being. But living to the fullest is mostly about love. “In the last hours of our lives we won’t remember the things we owned but rather the people we loved.“Black Friday is one of the most irrational days of the year strong proof of a growing materialist system, based on the short term and unsustainable. “We do not pretend to fight against Black Friday but we do offer a positive alternative.“It’s all about culture before materialism. Social empathy before greed. “It’s a day to be better following a day to have more.”As for the future, Jordi hopes to target one of the world’s largest commercial markets – America.He added: “We are already taking the first steps to develop the movement in the USA in  and we’re expecting more European cities to get involved too.“Black Friday may be popular but surely Fair Saturday makes more sense.”To support Fair Saturday and find out about events in your area, visit the website at https:app.fairsaturday.org.

A recent survey revealed that one in five people had not heard of credit unions, and only two-fths of those questioned thought they would be eligible to be a member of a credit union. The survey also found that one in four people wrongly believed that credit unions make profits for shareholders, just like banks.The campaign – ‘People, Not Profit’ – aims to highlight that credit unions are not-for-profit organisations, providing loans and savings, and that most people living in Scotland would be eligible to join at least one credit union based on where they work or where they live. Aileen Campbell, Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Local Government, said: “In helping build a fairer Scotland, we want to protect people from getting into unmanageable debt and falling into the hands of predatory, high cost lenders.“A key part of this is making sure that people are aware of the financial services and fair alternatives available, including credit union membership.“Our new campaign will highlight the benefits of joining a credit union. I would encourage everyone to visit the new website to find out more.”Michael Sheen, actor and social activist, has worked with the Scottish Government to produce a short video explaining what a credit union is. He said: “I’m very pleased to be backing the ‘People, Not Profit’ campaign, and I share the Scottish Government’s ambition to grow and raise awareness of this sector. “I’m a member of a credit union myself, and so I know first-hand the benefits they offer. “What’s important to me is that they are owned by the people who actually use their services, and any profits that they make are invested back into the credit union.”A new website has been set up to support the ‘People, Not Profit’ campaign.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Monday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmOrkney Islands Council has said Albert Street and Bridge Street, in Kirkwall, will be closed to traffic at times in the week ahead while repair work takes place.

These concerns were echoed by the group of experts giving evidence to the Committee this morning.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr McArthur said: “Today’s evidence session left no doubt at all that the Scottish Government is now isolated over its approach to tackle fuel poverty in rural and island areas. It is increasingly clear that Ministers will have to think again and ensure their proposals are properly #island proofed#.“In a desperate move yesterday evening, the Housing Minister issued a briefing to MSPs seeking to justy his decision not to include a rural Minimum Income Standard in the revised definition of rural fuel poverty.  This attempt by the Minister to get his retaliation in first backfired, however, as the Committee heard again today how this approach flies in the face of all the advice.“The Rural Fuel Poverty Task Force, the government’s own Independent Panel of Advisers and every organisation across the Highlands  Islands involved in housing and fuel poverty have made plain that excluding a rural MIS risks support not going to the people and communities who need it. As a result, the government’s own targets for combatting fuel poverty across the country will be undermined.“While fuel poverty is not simply an island issue, all the evidence shows that it affects rural and island communities more than others. Hopefully, today’s committee evidence session will persuade ministers to think again. If not, it will be up to parliament to force the government to do the right thing”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There are a number of potential routes we could now take with them – some of which offer us the opportunity to generate income, some to make savings # and officers will be exploring these opportunities in due course.”According to OIC, the Stewart Endowment Trust disperses the majority of its funds locally, including to NHS Orkney. The council therefore anticipates that most of the money generated from the sale will stay in and benefit Orkney.Iain Macdonald, chair of the Stewart Endowment Trust said: “The Stewart Endowment Trustees offered these islands for sale in order to generate funds, which are used to support the work of local congregations, the Balfour Hospital and a couple of national charities, as defined by the Endowment’s founding document.#We are delighted that they will be moving into ship of the local authority, where they will remain a precious asset for the whole community for generations to come.”The main island, Faray is around  acres, the Holm of Faray around  acres and the smallest of the three, Red Holm, is just five acres.There are a number of ruinous dwelling houses scattered across Faray together with a bothy which is housed in the former school. The island is mainly semi-improved grassland and has several sandy beaches together with rocky shorelines and clfs.According to the council, Faray had a population of  in , falling to  by . By the late s, there were eight crofting families living on the island, making a living through lobster fishing. In  the last islander had left Faray.The islands are home to a colony of grey seals with parts designated as a Site of Special Scientic Interest and Special Area of Conservation.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The daughter of a self-made man, Coates gained a first in econometrics and went on to build her business up from scratch as a result of an instinct for the future and sheer hard graft. As that business grew, she based it in Stoke – bringing good jobs to a languishing post-industrial city – and set up a foundation which has donated £m to charities like Oxfam and CAFOD. On top of throwing energy into growing her company, she has five children, four of whom are adopted from the same family.There is a lot to commend there in , her entrepreneurship was recognised when she was awarded a CBE for her services to the community and business and the following year she was named one of the UK’s most powerful women by BBC Radio ’s Woman’s Hour.And yet for all Coates’ undoubted attributes, there is no getting away from the central fact: her online betting company, Bet, which last year had an operating profit of £m, has flourished on the back of the UK’s two million problem gamblers and the obscene salary she pays herself – which is , times the national average – is money that would have been better staying in the pockets of those iniduals who can ill afford to lose on the horses .Much attention has been paid to the evils of Fixed Odds Betting Terminalswhich have been spreading like smallpox in the UK’s most deprived areas where people stake what little money they haveon the vain hope of beating the system.FOBTs – described as the “crack cocaine of gambling” – are so pernicious because bets of up to £ can be placed every  seconds often the terminals are juxtaposed with pawnshops encouraging those who have already lost too much to trade their possessions for one more go.After a succession of suicides were linked to FOBTs, the government promised to reduce the maximum stake to £. Of course, reducing the maximum stake reduces profits, which in turn reduces income to the Treasury. It took the resignation of sports minister Tracey Crouch to force the government to back down on plans to delay the move until October . Thanks to Crouch, it will now take place in April as originally promised.This is a step forward but the understandable focus on FOBTs means the burgeoning issue of online gambling has been less publicised. Which brings us back to Coates. Coates is no stranger to high stakes. She began her career in her family’s bookmakers business. In , she realised the future of gambling was online and borrowed £m from RBS with the family firm as collateral. Her risk paid off as Bet has grown into one of the world’s largest online gambling companies, taking £.bn in wagers last year alone.But there are many things about Betthat don’t sit easy. There’s its name for a start. Bet is encouraging consistent, daily betting – not the odd flutter on the World Cup or the Grand National.Then there’s the whole tax avoidance thing. Like most online gambling companies Bet moved its headquarters to Gibraltar because of its more “favourable regulations” .But mostly, the unease with Coates’ success comes from knowing it is built onan upsurge in online gambling amongst smart phone-using millennials who can place a bet at the tap of a screen. Unlike casinos and indeed FOBTs, online gambling sites can be accessed day or night, sober or drunk, and using a credit card. The service Coates’ company offers is not merely  days a year, but also  .A recent report from the Gambling Commission showed  to -year-olds are the group most likely to have more than five online gaming accounts and to have gambled in the past four months.Online, stakes on casino games like blackjack and roulette have been known to be as high as £,. In sports, there is now a panoply of hypotheticals you can take a punt on. Where once the options were fairly limited – the final result, the highest goal scorer – there is much more focus on in-play betting: the first penalty, the first red card or even, in one famous case, whether or not a particular player will eat a pie on camera. Sure, some of this is harmless – a way of adding a bit of extra excitement to the event but it’s not the harmless gambling that brings the likes of Bet the millions it’s the problem gambling. Coates’ financial success also underlines the way in which gambling and football have become totally enmeshed. North and south of the border, betting companies such as William Hill and Ladbrokes sponsor leagues and cups and strips, largely replacing tobacco and alcohol brands.In Coates’ case, the connection is even closer Bet has . per cent of the shares in Stoke City FC Coates’ father Peter is the chairman and her husband Robert is a director.Online gambling is widespread among players who tend to have a lot of down time sitting around hotel rooms with nothing to do but play on their phones there is peer pressure too. It gives the players something to bond over, the irony being, of course, thatthey are caught gambling on football matches they face a fine or suspension.I suppose you could argue that making money out of gambling is no worse than making it out of smoking or drinking all three involve fostering potential addictions. But in Coates’ case, it’s the sheer scale of the inidual profiteering that shocks. The £m she is pocketing this year alone is more than double the total wage bill for Stoke City.That sum would be offensive enough in any sphere butshe were making her money from manufacturing a product or providing a service or creating something of social value, then at least there would be a quid pro quo.As it is, it is dirty, predatory money, and she’s made no attempt to cleanse it the addiction charity Addaction claims the sum she paid herself is over  times more than the entire industry’s contribution to treatment, and her foundation has made no contribution to that cause.To say Coates has worked hard for what she has earned is not enough to say she is not breaching any laws is a cop-out.The growth of Bet depends on persuading more and more people to squander money they cannot afford on a game that, in the long-run, they will always lose. And – successful woman in a man’s world though she is – that’s not something to celebrate.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4835179.1543253217!/image/image.jpg","title":"edinburgh trams staff vote to strike at christmas","story":"TRAM drivers have voted by a big majority in favour strike action during the festive period in protest at alleged bullying by bosses.Almost  per cent of Unite members who took part in the ballot favoured industrial action.The vote came after the union accused tram management of “harsh and unjust” disciplinary action against employees.It said staff were being subjected to a hostile and bullying management culture, including victimisation, suspensions and dismissals.Unite regional officer Lyn Turner welcomed the ballot result and warned thatthe strike action went ahead it was likely to take place in the run-up to Christmas and to New Year “including New Year’s Eve”. - Helen Martin: Edinburgh’s now a fairground ride that we can’t get offIt would be the first strike action to hit Edinburgh’s trams since they started running in May .But Mr Turner said he hoped talks between the union and tram bosses would lead to a resolution of the dispute before that.The ballot had an . per cent turnout, with . per cent voting in favour of a strike and . per cent against.Mr Turner said: “This result gives our members a resounding mandate for action.“We are currently in talks with management and are hopeful that we can come to a sensible agreement which fully addresses our members concerns and avoids the need to take action.“Unite does not want to play Scrooge by interrupting Christmas travel for Edinburgh’s citizens, but we need management to recognise that our members have legitimate concerns that must be addressed.“We have met with senior management for the last two weeks, discussions have been progressing and we hope management see sense so all this can be put to bed and the drivers can get back to what they do best - driving trams.” - Two men assaulted in early morning Cowgate attack The union raised a collective grievance over the problem of “inappropriate use of disciplinary measures” in August and held a consultative ballot last month which produced an  per cent vote for industrial action.Unite accused management of resorting too quickly to the disciplinary process rather than trying to deal with issues in a more constructive way.Mr Turner said: “A hostile and aggressive management culture does not deliver a safe and productive workplace, nor does it indicate dignity and respect in its treatment of workers.”Aspokesman for Edinburgh Trams said: “We are continuing to engage in productive conversations with Unite to better understand their concerns.“We are very hopeful we will be able to resolve the dispute in the near future without the need for industrial action.”Tory transport spokesman Councillor Nick Cook said: “With a high turnout and strong percentage in favour of strike, Unite has demonstrated fair grounds for industrial action.

Bob Fulton, a Rolls-Royce engine inspector, s to his section, upset and anxious. He’s just told colleagues that a Chilean Air Force jet engine has arrived in the factory for maintenance and he’s refusing to let it go through, in protest against the recent military coup of General Pinochet. He’s seen the images of people packed into football stadiums awaiting charge, torture and execution. He’s seen the Chilean Air Force jets bombing Santiago on TV News, and now one of the engines from those very planes is right there, waiting for inspection. He can see his supervisors approaching, he knows he’s about to be fired yet he feels a responsibility to people he will never meet, from another continent, hemisphere and culture.Why  WellBob was living in Chile, not Scotland, he would likely have been in those trucks, on those torture tables and maybe finally in those gutters.As a trade unionist, survivor of war, skilled craftsman and active citizen, the shape of Bob’s entire le produced the conviction that he could and should take a stand.So Bob and his colleagues refused to service the Rolls Royce engines and began the astonishing train of events that placed an almighty Lanarkshire spanner in Pinochet’s mighty killing machine, saving the lives of countless Chilean folk.This story of everyday heroism is being told for the first time – and just in time given the age of participants -- in a film called Nae Pasaran, showing in art-house venues around Scotland and the UK right now. It’s a moving, painstakingly researched, funny and beautully made film which demonstrates the power of solidarity and comradeship among men lucky enough to complete their working lives before our diminished and precarious world of de-unionised, casual employment, out-sourcing and zero hour contracts drew breath. It shows the dogged determination of one filmmaker to track down interviewees across generations and two hemispheres.And, as we stand on the brink of a shameless, corrupt and nakedly greedy milestone in British history – it shows with searing clarity how British society has changed.The relatively confident, moral and organised society of the s produced citizens able to make easy connections between workers across the world. That society has gone – though it’s not completely extinguished in Scotland.Over four intervening decades, Britain has become a byword for political hostility to immigrants and indference to Windrush citizens a country where scapegoating the EU for every British problem and accusing EU nationals of queue-jumping has poisoned the well of democracy so badly that no rational decision about Brexit can be taken for fear of further infuriating a ripped-off underclass of workers with no hope of change in their lives, except a downward spiral into the abject poverty described recently by an UN envoy whose report has been dismissed as impertinent by the UK government.Over the  years that Bob and his friends grew older, retired, watched families grow up and passed on their values to children and grand-children, Britain has morphed into an elitist, market-led society where citizens experience the state as atomised consumers and humiliated claimants – not primarily as well-resourced workers. The British economy depends on the privatisation of natural monopolies and the deregulation of almost everything . Our state acts without pity or mercy, lies as it breathes and uses a balance sheet for a moral compass.So it’s no surprise that Britain refuses to end arms sales to Saudi Arabia despite the international outcry over Jamal Khashoggi’s killing, the role our weapons continue to play in perpetuating war and famine and the principled stand by Germany, Finland and Denmark who’ve ended arms sales. What a contrast to the s Labour Government which led worldwide condemnation of the military coup in Chile and created an escape route for dissidents until Margaret Thatcher won power and helped prop up Pinochet and his murderous regime.A friend to dictators – that’s what Britain has become. And that’s why Scots desperately need an injection of the insight, determination, morality and clarity of Bob Fulton, John Keenan and Robert Sommerville right now, because we face some massive moral decisions – as voters, workers and citizens.Can every union and worker at Scots-based arms manufacturers just ignore the powerful parallels with  or will just one worker draw inspiration from the men of East Kilbride, and refuse to supply weapons to the Saudi regime Nae Pasaran’s Facebook page contains this powerful observation from a recent viewer: “Many of the folk making bombsights for despots will never work againthey down tools for political reasons. It’s going to take decades to reverse that situation...we ever do. But when I come to be judged, the crime that will send me to the underworld is that my generation allowed the present political class to take power uncontested.”Such abdication of responsibility is just not possible now. Scotland is set to be hauled out of the EU in coming months – out of an arena in which workers rights are taken seriously, trade unions are part of enduring social contracts and respect for human rights underpins international law.If that happens, the journey back to something resembling an equal, caring society will look so long and arduous that many Scots will simply give up. And we can’t. That’s why every Scot should see this filmthey possibly can. Nae Pasaran is testimony to how much Scotland has lost as a society but also how much is retained – above all the knowledge that we have a choice about serving the super-rich, facilitating their wars and creating tools of repression and a choice about remaining in a union that demands our compliance and ignores our political priorities. The old heroes of East Kilbride will stir something in every person lucky enough to see their story.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie

She will visit Scotland later this week.“My deal delivers for every corner of the UK and I will work hard to strengthen the bonds that unite us as we look ahead to our future outside of the EU,” Mrs May said, adding she had “fought to ensure that powers ing from the EU will be restored to the National Assembly for Wales, the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly”.: Brexit: British and EU leaders warn ‘there is no plan B’The Prime Minister also came under attack from senior Brexiteers including Iain Duncan Smith, Boris Johnson and David Davis.Downing Street also stepped up the campaign in Parliament, writing to MPs with an explicit warning that voting against the deal could result in a second EU referendum that reverses Brexit. It was confirmed there will be five days of debate over two weeks, starting on  December.Yesterday the Prime Minister made her third Commons statement in less than a fortnight, bringing to nearly nine hours the amount of time she has spent facing largely hostile questions from MPs.She appealed to Brexiteers in her own party not to reject the deal, insisting that it “delivers for the British people”.But she found little support on her own benches, with nearly an hour passing before any MP spoke up in favour.In a worrying sign for Downing Street, the former defence secretary Michael Fallon, seen as a loyal figure, warned the deal was a “huge gamble” that traded away large amounts of sovereignty without any guarantee of a positive trade deal.Mrs May tried to tackle the source of Brexiteer anger head on, saying the UK would have crashed out of the EU unless it had accepted the Irish border backstop.“I do not pretend that either we or the EU are entirely happy with these arrangements,” she said. “But there is no alternative deal that honours our commitments to Northern Ireland which does not involve this insurance policy. And the EU would not have agreed any future partnership without it.”She added: “Put simply, there is no deal that comes without a backstop, and without a backstop there is no deal.”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Commons would have “very little choice” but to reject Mrs May’s “botched” deal. He said: “There can be no doubt this deal would leave us with the worst of all worlds – no say over future rules and no certainty for the future.”He added: “Ploughing on is not stoic, it’s an act of national self-harm. Instead of threatening this House with a no-deal scenario of a no-Brexit scenario, the Prime Minister now needs to prepare a plan B.”There was evidence of another appeal for cross-party support when Mrs May said she was wrong for suggesting EU nationals had “jumped the queue” ahead of immigrants from other countries. She told the SNP’s Philippa Whitford: “I should not have used that language in that speech.”SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford had earlier attacked Mrs May over the comments, calling them a “slur” and telling the Commons the Brexit deal “blatantly disregards the rights that we will all lose to live and work in Europe. We are not prepared to give up those rights”.He also emphasised the SNP’s support for another referendum on EU membership.The Scottish Government will publish its analysis of the economic impact from Mrs May’s Brexit deal today.Constitutional relations secretary Michael Russell said it was now clear that MPs were being asked to vote on a “blindfold Brexit with major issues left unresolved”.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

stand-off.The breakthrough follows \"extremely positive and constructive\" high-level discussions between the hotel group and Highland Council.Local Highland High Leusers have been unable to use the leisure pool since the end of August when access ended because of a funding wrangle.Macdonald Hotels chairman Donald Macdonald and deputy chairman Gordon Fraser met with the councils new chief executive Donna Manson in Aviemore on Tuesday and reached a one-year agreement to resolve the stalemate.HLH users will not have to pay any additional charges which had been one of the options on the table as attempts were made to break the deadlock.There is further good news with confirmation that HLH swimming lessons for children and aquafit will also resume.Details of the funding arrangements have not yet been made public nor when the doors will re-open.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Fraser said: \"Were extremely encouraged by the positive and constructive approach taken by Donna Manson and her team and are very happy that we have reached an agreement which will see the local High Le Highland members enjoying the facilities at Aviemore Resort very soon.\"We understand that local authorities throughout the country are facing financial pressures and that there is a clear responsibility to spend tax-payers money wisely.\"We were also encouraged by the recognition of our own position that we have had to swallow a wide range of very signicant cost increases in rates, energy bills and staffing costs over the past  months.\"Mr Fraser continued: \"Its clear that both we and the council were very keen to welcome back local people and reach a clear and swt resolution to what has been an unfortunate situation for everyone concerned, and particularly for the many local High Le Highland members.\"For our part, we are very keen to have our local guests back through the doors, and I know that members of the local community will be happy that this matter has been resolved.\"The new agreement will allow time for further consultation on public access to the leisure facilities in future years.Highland Council convener Bill Lobban, who lives in Aviemore, said: \"I am delighted that a sensible agreement has been reached.\"This new deal is great news for Highland Council, High Le Highland and Macdonald Aviemore Resort but most importantly its fantastic news for the residents of Badenoch and Strathspey.\"The swimming pool is a well-used, important attraction and I would like to congratulate the staff from both sides who have worked really hard behind the scenes to get this result and more especially members of the local community who made sure that their voice was heard in the process.\"Well done to all.\"A positive community campaign had been launched called Save Our Swimming following the doors closing to HLH users at the end of the summer.SOS co-ordinator Joe Kirby described the agreement as a fantastic result for all the parties.He said: \"It is great that the council and Macdonald Hotels have listened to the concerns of the community and that a pragmaticto talks has delivered this deal.\"I know as a father myself that folk across the strath will be really looking forward to getting backing into the swimming pool with their children and other families members.\"Id like to thank everyone who wrote correspondence to Macdonald Hotels, attended the public meetings and demonstrations and who helped to fund the SOS  campaign.\"It all goes to show what can be achieve with a bit of community spirit.\"Judith Thurlow, chair of Aviemore Primary School parents council, was also absolutely delighted.\"This is a leline for so many members of our community and an essential skill for the local children to learn,\" she said.\"Thank you to everyone in the community who has persevered, shown great resilience and played a part in reaching this really positive outcome.\"Pupils from the school had written to Mr Macdonald imploring him to let them go swimming again and local GPs and aquafit users ndash some in their eighties ndash had also gone public with their health concerns.There had also been several peaceful protests at the resort by SOS  in the aftermath of the decision.The Strathy tried yesterday to contact the council and Macdonald Hotels for further information on the new funding arrangements and when

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting.

They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds. He died on  November ,  years ago this week.  test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27492  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaAt the start of the th century women began to campaign actively against the denial of their right to vote. In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27501  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna“We already have all-island teams that demonstrate that we can achieve great success when we work on an all-island basis.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"alanah is a real inspiration","story":"ALANAH McGlinchey tells this reporter that it has been “such a boost” to have been the recipient of Inspirational Secondary School Teacher at the recent Andersonstown News Inspirational Youth of the West gala ceremony held in the Devenish Complex.The Religion teacher who has been a familiar face among the halls and corridors of St Louise’s Comprehensive College since  also teaches a Year Nine form class who are still bringing in congratulatory cards and presents for the popular teacher.A graduate of St Mary’s University College, Alanah told the Andersonstown News that she felt “really proud of myself, of St Louise’s and for the pupils when I heard about the Inspirational Youth nomination”.“When it actually happened, that my name was read out on the night, it was just so nice. I am not doing the work here for the students to recognise me in that way, I teach because I love it but it was such a great boost. I came into the classroom so happy and delighted to share the news with the class,” she said.Alanah spoke of the importance of young teachers making their mark in the city especially with so many who are choosing to go across the water or travel further afield.“Loads of my friends have left and gone to Liverpool, places like Qatar. I’m very much a home bird, I love being here, teaching here but I ask myself the question what does going across to Liverpool to teach have that we don’t have here at home  How are we supposed to make young lives betterwe leave and take our skills where “There is a young teaching staff in the Religion department here and our big focus is very much on ethics, making the subject more relevant to the pupils’ lives, how do you live out your faith through action  The girls I teach are so kind, there is a real kindness about our pupils, they would offer you the food from their lunch boxes, they are just so, so caring. At the minute our ‘Mini Marillacs’ named after St Louise, are collecting for the homeless and I would put a big emphasis on helping those less fortunate and the girls would bring in hats, gloves, scarfs, toiletries which are then brought to the Legion of Mary for distribution.”“Our sixth years go up to St John’s residential home every Tuesday to make cups of tea, bring buns and biscuits for the elderly. I can see them from my window and it just makes me smile knowing they are going up and more importantly want to go up, you don’t have to police them,” she said.Alanah spoke warmly of the “community spirit” in St Louise’s and how “everybody knows everybody” as school le presents “always something new”.“This is a huge school but you know everyone in it. It’s like a wee family.

And he added that despite the fact that Remembrance Sunday was marked almost a fortnight ago, poppies are still being displayed by some staff – with some workers opting for the double-whammy of a banned football and the remembrance symbol.“Employees here are brazenly walking around in Rangers and Northern Ireland tops even though everybody knows the rules,” our source inside the factory said. “It’s not asCoca-Cola is a wee firm that employs two or three people in a shed. It’s a massive global company with strict rules in place to ensure harmony and equality and yet nothing is being done. People see other people wearing football tops and they think, ‘Oh, that’s allowed now.’ And the poppies are still around too as well as other symbols used by one side of the community. Sometimes they’re pinned to the banned jerseys.”The worker said that Catholic members of staff are disappointed by the lack of action by senior members of staff. He added that things would continue to get worse until existing policy is enforced.“Management have yet to do anything about it,” he said. No-one is even being talked to never mind disciplined for their actions.“Personally, I feel antagonised, intimidated and fearful working in a place that is allowing this to continue and I know others do too. This is a place of work and people should be able to come to work without being in fear or intimidated in this manner.”A spokesperson for Coca-Cola denied any knowledge of football shirts being worn in at the plant but pointed out that the wearing of poppies all year round is acceptable.“We are not aware of any recent instances of employees wearing football shirts at work. Doing so would be in contravention of our unorm and dress code policy. This follows the guidance of the NI Equality Commission which states that the wearing of football shirts has the potential to disrupt a good and harmonious working environment.“In line with the Commission’s guidance, we do not prohibit the wearing of a poppy at work.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"renowned west belfast artist to set out stall at culturlann","story":"PROLIFIC West Belfast painter and illustrator Tony Bell is set to unveil a personal retrospective exhibition entitled ‘Special People Special Places’ at the Cultúrlann on Thursday November .

These pressures have left many of our members on the verge of quitting their jobs.

However, we do not believe that in this instance such action is either proportionate or warranted. It is our firm belief that the issues at the heart of this dispute can best be dealt with through an open and honest dialogue which seeks to provide balance to the concerns of both sides.“CCMS echoes the Board of Governors in its call for a suspension to the proposed industrial action in order to create the time and space for meaningful and respectful dialogue aimed at resolving the issues of concern and dispute.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mps to vote on theresa mays brexit deal before christmas","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Appearing at the DUP conference on Saturday, Mr Johnson said the deal will leave the UK a “satellite state” of the EU. In the Sunday Express Mr Rees-Mogg said the deal “does not deliver” on Brexit and “instead of taking back control, in some areas it will leave the United Kingdom with even less control than it currently has: the vassal state”.DUP oppositionLIVE: Watch Rt Hon Arlene Foster MLA - Party Leader’s Address at the #DUP Party Conference in Belfast  https:w… https:t.co yhGYiTEN— DUPNovember , The Eurosceptics’ rejection of the plans stems in large part from the deal’s backstop provision for the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

The leading architect revealed he had received more than a dozen unsolicited emails from engineers and geologists inquiring about the project since the speech on Saturday. “It has been bubbling along since January,” said Professor Dunlop. “I thought that was the end of it, and then something  happens.“And then with Boris Johnson, Karen Bradley and the DUP bringing it up again, it just seems like a potential story and narrative which keeps moving on.”Last week the bridge was raised during a discussion in the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in Westminster. Responding to a question from the DUP’s Ian Paisley, Secretary of State Karen Bradley said she was willing to have a discussion about commissioning a feasibility study on the bridge, but noted there were issues around the sea bed and the current site of the proposed bridge link. Addressing the DUP annual conference on Saturday, former foreign secretary Mr Johnson said proposals for a bridge link were being held back by the “absence of political will”. “I think that there will be a feasibility study, which is all I can ask for. That’s all I’ve ever asked for,” said Professor Dunlop.“I am not suggesting for a moment it is going to be a walk in the park.

Mr Dunlop first envisioned the idea for the bridge link after being asked to do so by a newspaper in Scotland. He laid out two proposals for the route — one from Larne and Portpatrick, potentially costing around £bn or a shorter crossing between the Mull of Kintyrne and Torr Head, which could cost between £bn and £bn.The proposal received a boost in March after a spokesman for the Scottish Government said it would “initiate discussions to explore improving connectivity” between the island of Ireland and Scotland, adding it was important “that all options are fully considered”."},{"url":null,"title":"taoiseach leo varadkar hails ongoing dialogue with orange order","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The second is a hard Brexit, clf-edge, no-deal scenario.“In many ways, it’s the same thing, it’s just a graduated response upwards. We are making those preparations. But we need to be realistic here. There’s no country in the European Union that can be fully prepared for a clf-edge, no-deal Brexit.

it would ‘transform’ the Strand Road area into a thriving hospitality hub.“We’re delighted to be extended the capacity, and we’ll be doing that through the conversion of what’s known as a ‘setback floor’, which will now be used for accommodation,” he said.“We’re currently looking at a March  opening date, and we’re excited about the impact this will have on the Strand Road area.“There’s been a lot of investment in that part of the town over the past years, there’s a great iety of places to eat and of course we’ve had Primrose really putting a lot of effort in.“Hopefully, we’ll also play our part in transforming the Strand Road and helping to increase footfall.”He added: “What you have to keep in mind is that every person who stays in Derry, spends in Derry, be that going out for a bite to eat, a drink, or taking a taxi somewhere, that is money which is pumped into the local economy and will not be lost to other areas.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein accuse inla turning derry housing estate ghetto","story":"Sinn Fein has accused the INLA of turning a housing estate in Derry into a ‘ghetto’ due to an upsurge in graffiti in the area which had come at the same time as a spate of recent attacks.The comments came at Thursday afternoon’s monthly meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council, during a discussion on the setting up of a new task force to tackle ‘offensive’ graffiti.Speaking at the meeting, the Sinn Fein councillor Eric McGinley said that the appearance of INLA graffiti in the Ballymagroarty had coincided with a number of recent attacks in the area.“I would highlight the appearance of INLA graffiti in a number of areas, particularly in Ballymagroarty, and almost a parallel link in attacks on people and property in the estate,” he said.“There’s understandable speculation as to whether all that is linked, and many residents have been expressing concern recently as to why Ballymagroarty is being targeted.”He added: “Why is it happening, especially when you consider that the INLA declared a ceasefire in , announced an end to its armed campaign in  and decommissioned weaponry on .“The INLA, or the Irish Republican Socialist Party , some of whose members might be in this chamber, actually explain to the residents of Ballymagroarty, why the area they’re living in is turning into a ghetto ”He then called on all councillors who represent the Foyleside ward to join him in a ‘unied’ call for an end to the attacks, the removal of the graffiti which he said is ‘blighting’ the Ballymagroarty estate.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“We believe that call will let the Ballymagroarty community know that we share their concerns and that we will do all we can to improve their quality of le,” he added.The independent councillor Darren O’Reilly, who represents the Foyleside area, said he would like to ‘update’ Cllr McGinley that he had working with youth groups and the Education Authorityon the issue of political graffiti.‘Masked men’He continued that it was ‘important’ not to ‘demonise’ the young people who may be involved iN such activity and ‘work with them’.Meanwhile, the independent councillor Warren Robinson added that he wished to echo Cllr O’Reilly’s sentiments.“To sit on your high horse and condemn will not sort the issue out, and as elected representatives we have a responsibility to the young people who are doing this to engage with them,” he said. “I would agree that some of this graffiti is unsightly and should be removed,” he continued, before adding that community activists were already involved in these discussions.The independent councillor Paul Gallagher said that Cllr McGinley had been ‘very selective’ and said we ‘could also talk about masked men running about the Bogside for the benefit of tourists’, while the independent councillor Gary Donnelly accused Sinn Fein of engaging in ‘political point-scoring’."},{"url":null,"title":"visiting tangent clubs luminary on hand to switch on llandrindod wells christmas

I hope new hotel investment, which would provide the local economy with a signicant boost, can be realised, he added.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the council undertook a study to review hotel provision across the district and identied additional need specically within the Newcastle area.ldquoThe council has carried out an initial feasibility study on the Newcastle Centre site which identied that a hotel could be built on the site. General discussions have subsequently taken place with a number of potential developers about hotel provision in the Newcastle area,rsquorsquo he continued.ldquoThe council is also currently working with a consultant on the feasibility study for leisure provision in the Newcastle area and it is anticipated that a report will be presented to the Active and Healthy Communities Committee in the coming months..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan wildlife activist recognised by Prime Minster  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN teenager has been recognised by Prime Minister Theresa May for urging young people to protect the environment.Fourteen year-old Dara McAnulty is one of the latest recipients of the the Points of Light award, which recognises outstanding volunteers who are making a change in their community and inspiring others.He was presented with his award at an event held at Kew Gardens in London last week.Mrs May wrote to Dara congratulating him on his achievement.ldquoThrough your award-winning blog, you are encouraging young people to support their local environment and learn about the importance of conservation, she said.ldquoYour writing is raising awareness of how nature can help people cope with autism and you should feel proud of this remarkable achievement.Dara has been a driving force behind the Grassroots Challenge run by Ulster Wildle.In his blog he encourages other people his age to make videos of the out-doors and at the same time participate in conservation.Dara, who is autistic, says he is inspired by the beauty of the Mourne countryside on his doorstep and that developing a connection with nature helps him manage his anxiety.This in turn helped him to open the door for other people his age to become conservation enthusiasts too.Dara said: ldquoI am honoured to receive the Points of Light award. I sincerely hope that it shines a light on how vital nature is to us all, our mental health, our wellbeing and the survival of all le.ldquoWe need more young voices to speak up and take action for nature though. I will continue my work and hope that many more will follow.Dara recently worked with Springwatch presenter Chris Packham on The Peoplersquos Walk for Wildlecampaign.He spoke to , people at Hyde Park about conservation and also completed a -mile walk that raised over pound, to tag and record threatened birds of prey.He is soon to publish a book called lsquoDiary of a Young Naturalistrsquo based on his blog, which won runner-up in the BBC Wildle Magazine Blogger Awards.Charlotte Hill, CEO of Step Up To Serve, which coordinates the #iwill campaign, said: ldquoWe know that young people have the energy, ideas and drive to address issues in their community and to tackle many of societyrsquos tougher challenges.ldquoWe are so pleased to see the Prime Minister recognising the astounding achievements that Dara has made through his volunteering, fundraising and campaigning, and hope this inspires Dara and other young people to continue their fantastic work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Class act Connolly secures final spot  ","story":"RYAN Connolly was the hero of the hour as Olympic claimed their spot in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final and also claimed the bragging rights in Ballynahinch.Connolly made two saves in the penalty shoot-out and then converted the decisive spot kick at the end of a largely forgettable semi-final at Bignian Park on Friday night.Olympic will face either Killough or Celtic Bhoys, who meet this Friday night in the second semi-final at the same venue, in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Boxing Day showpiece at Drumaness.There was little to cheer the good-sized crowd who braved the Mourne chill well into the night.One hundred and ten minutes of football produced barely a handful of chances, which meant that all the excitement was reserved for the spot kick shoot-out.Connolly had little to do over normal and extra time, but he produced the goods when it mattered and was mobbed by his delighted team-mates after putting his spot kick past Raymond Tate in the YM goal.However, Olympic know they will have up their gamethey are to pose a threat to either Killough or Celtic Bhoys in the final.Neither they nor YM could be faulted for effort. The players ran their socks off and there was plenty of commitment. The tackling was hard, but fair, and it was a credit to the spirit in which the tie was played that not a single player was yellow-carded.The first half chance of the match fell to nippy YM striker Aaron Cheevers, who was almost through on goal, but was thwarted when Connolly came quickly off his line to save.Jack Roddy then headed narrowly over for Olympic and not long afterwards Olympic were awarded a free kick outside the box following Richard Annettrsquos challenge on Shane Rodgers. Unfortunately, Darryl Russell shot tamely against the wall.The best chance of the half fell to Olympic just after the half hour. Following a corner Gary Wilsonrsquos shot was cleared off the line and Roddy blazed over the bar.Cheevers was always a threat up front for the YM. On  minutes he was clean through, but again Connolly came out to thwart the danger. On  minutes he came within inches of putting his head on a cross by the impressive Wilson and just before the break his flicked header were narrowly wide.Ten minutes into the second half Olympicrsquos Simon Marmion found Joshua Fennell with a long pass, only for Fennell to shoot over from outside the penalty area on the right side.Four minutes later Damian Travers found himself with space in the box, but his left-footed shot was easilysaved by Connolly.On  minutes YMrsquos Sam Annett let fly, but his shot took a deflection off an Olympic defender for a corner.Both sides made a number of changes to break the deadlock and with five minutes to go YM substitute James Croskery shot low and hard, but straight at Connolly.The breakthrough nearly came moments later when Wilson delivered a dangerous free kick into the YM box, but Adam McDowell and Lee Maxwell couldnrsquot get a touch.In the first period of extra time, Rhys Patterson thought he had won it for Olympic, but Tate pulled off a great save.Just at the end of the second period Ronnie Johnston shot inches wide for YM after a good cross from the left by Adam McDowell.But the goals didnrsquot come and in the end it was all down to a penalty shoot-out.

The council also hopes to acquire match funding from central government.Among the key issues identied by council officials is either restricting or banning altogether unsorted black bin bag waste. Thousands of people regularly empty a iety waste into the bin bags and take them to the recycling centres. But that could be about to change.Council officials also want to vigorously challenge the perception that the centres are viewed by many as ldquodumps and reinforce the message that they are for recycled waste only.They say the misuse of the centres has potential cost implications for the authority, with the review examining detailed guidelines and systems which are required for what is being described as the ldquoproper operation of the recycling centres.The review examined entrance policies and a potential restriction or complete ban on large vans using the centres with a daily restriction on the amount of waste the facilities can receive.There is also growing concern at senior management level that a signicant amount of the waste being taken to recycling centres ends up in the general waste stream as it cannot be recycled. Council officials say addressing this issue will cut costs and produce savings.Last night, politicians were asked for permission to complete a detailed report on the way forward, based on the evidence gathered during the review process, with a particular focus on centre opening hours and staffing levels that must be achieved at no extra cost.Councillors were told the report will also make a recommendation to harmonise policies and procedures across all current recycling centres in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Over recent months, local politicians have expressed concern at a number of fly-tipping and illegal dumping incidents across the district, with several taking place within a stonersquos throw of the Cloonagh Road facility in Downpatrick.This particular facility has long since passed its sell-by-date with work on a poundm replacement at the nearby Flying Horse Road currently underway.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

representatives from retail, hospitality and manufacturing bodies met pro-Remain parties Sinn Fein, the SDLP, Alliance and the Green Party in a joint meeting at Stormont.They later met DUP leader Arlene Foster and MEP Diane Dodds.Meanwhile, the Ulster Unionist Party said it has an ongoing series of engagements with business leaders this week.Northern Ireland voted for the UK to remain as part of the European Union in the  referendum.Sinn Fein, the SDLP, Alliance and Green Party claim to be the voice of the majority in Northern Ireland.The DUP backed the Leave campaign and have opposed Theresa May’s draft Withdrawal Agreement.A comment by DUP MP Sammy Wilson last week accusing businesses who back the withdrawal deal as being “the puppets of the Northern Ireland Office” had the potential to sour relations but Angela McGowan, of CBI NI, insisted it had been put behind them.“We haven’t taken that comment too seriously so I think we’ll all just try to put that to bed and move forward,” she said.Northern Ireland Retail Consortium director Aodhan Connolly said it is a “Rubicon moment for Northern Ireland”.“This meeting was an excellent chance for us to air our concerns on the proposed Withdrawal Agreement and explain in detail why the needs of Northern Ireland cannot be met by a disastrous no-deal Brexit,” he said.“With higher costs and half the discretionary income of GB households, we cannot afford to absorb the catastrophic cost rises that a clf-edge no-deal would bring.“We need Northern Ireland politicians to use their influence to bring pressure to bear in Westminster.Belfast craft beer business toasts success in Singapore Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“This is a Rubicon moment for Northern Ireland and we need the best deal possible.”Mrs Foster said she and Mrs Dodds had presented their case against the Withdrawal Agreement.“This was a useful meeting where we were able to outline why the Withdrawal Agreement would be bad for the long-term Northern Ireland economy,” she said.“A particular focus was placed on how the Withdrawal Agreement would set the EU in control of many of our rules and regulations yet Northern Ireland businesses would have no democratic input.”Mrs Foster said she believes the focus at this point should be on trying to get a better deal.“It is clear there is no enthusiasm for this Withdrawal Agreement in the House of Commons,” she said.“Businesses want certainty, therefore should not waste the next few weeks in advance of the meaningful vote, especially when many parliamentarians have already made up their minds to reject the deal.“We should use this time to work on getting a better deal which works for the UK and Northern Ireland.”Earlier, Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle O’Neill said her party along with the SDLP, Alliance and Green Party spoke for a “cross-community majority”.“We collectively as four pro-Remain parties have been consistent in saying we speak for a cross-community majority of people here who voted to remain and clearly as we enter into the next number of weeks, this really is crunch time,” she said.“What’s on the table currently in the form of the Withdrawal Agreement is the least worst outcome.”try catch     .               ..

A deal that delivers for the British people.”In a sign that she aims to go over fractious MPs’ heads and appeal directly to voters for their backing, Mrs May said parliamentarians had a “duty” to listen to their constituents before taking their decision in the national interest.But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Commons would have “very little choice” but to reject Mrs May’s “botched” deal, which he described as “bad for this country”.With  or more Conservative MPs indicating they could rebel in the “meaningful vote”, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay admitted Mrs May faces a “challenging” ision.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker warned that there would be no more negotiationMPs vote down the agreement, telling the BBC: “This is the best deal for Britain ... and this is the only deal possible, sothe House says no, we would have no deal.”Brexit: No deal would be disastrous for NI, business leaders tell parties Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Addressing the Commons the day after ing from Brussels, Mrs May said: “I can say to the House with absolute certainty that there is not a better deal available.“Our duty as a Parliament over these coming weeks is to examine this deal in detail, to debate it respectfully, to listen to our constituents and decide what is in our national interest.”Mrs May said MPs faced a choice: “We can back this deal, deliver on the vote of the referendum and move on to building a brighter future of opportunity and prosperity for all our people. Or this House can choose to reject this deal and go back to square one.“Because no-one knows what would happenthis deal doesn’t pass. It would open the door to more ision and more uncertainty, with all the risks that will entail.”Mr Corbyn said: “The Prime Minister sayswe reject this deal, it will take us back to square one. The truth is, under this Government we have never got off square one.“This botched deal is still a bad deal for the country and all yesterday did was mark the end of this Government’s failed and miserable negotiations.”Mrs May told MPs the Government had ensured that Gibraltar was covered by the Withdrawal Agreement and would negotiate a future relationship “for the whole UK family, including Gibraltar”.She sent a message to residents of the Rock: “We will always stand by you. We are proud that Gibraltar is British and our position on sovereignty has not and will not change.”In a riposte to French President Emmanuel Macron’s suggestion that the EU could delay trade talks unless its fishermen were granted access to UK waters, the PM said: “The EU have maintained throughout this process that they wanted to link overall access to markets to access to fisheries.“They failed in the Withdrawal Agreement, and they failed again in the Political Declaration.“It is no surprise some are already trying to lay down markers again for the future relationship, but they should be getting used to the answer by now: it is not going to happen.”The PM told her Cabinet at a meeting on Monday morning that Sunday’s agreement was “a signicant moment” which had proved wrong those who said it would not be possible to reach a deal.The two-hour meeting also heard an update from Mr Barclay on preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit, which are continuing despite the deal being agreed in Brussels.Following her address to the Commons, Mrs May was due to host a meeting at  Downing Street of more than  investors and employers from sectors including manufacturing, retail, food and drink and financial services to discuss the Brexit plan.Meanwhile, Downing Street chief of staff Gavin Barwell and effective deputy prime minister David Lidington have invited opposition MPs to a briefing on the agreement.But Downing Street sources said they were not aware of the Prime Minister seeking to speak to Labour MPs thought to be considering backing her deal.Analysis by the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority of the impact of the Withdrawal Agreement and Future Framework on the UK economy is to be published on Thursday.Ahead of the vote in Parliament, Mrs May has started a campaign to sell her deal directly to the public, with visits to all parts of the UK planned.Her spokesman declined to confirm or deny reports that Number  is considering a possible TV debate with Mr Corbyn, something the Labour leader has made clear he would relish.try catch     .               ..

give voters in Northern Ireland an opportunity to elect MPs who would take up their seats.Leo Varadkar also said the party should take their seats ahead of the crucial Brexit vote, despite its abstention policy.“Sinn Fein is an unusual party in that it isn’t taking up its seats in Westminster for one reason and not taking its seats in Stormont for another,” he added.“Generally, people who get involved in politics do so because they want to make a dference and they want to use the democratic process to get good outcomes for their citizens.“If they are not willing to take up their seats because they feel they can’t because they got elected on the basis of abstention, they do have the option now of resigning their seats and allowing people in those constituencies to decide whether or not they want to have a say when this vote comes to Westminster.”Responding to Mr Varadkar’s comments, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald said her party had “no intention of standing aside and abandoning our mandate”.She added:“The reality is that the people of ‘those constituencies’ have already spoken and they chose abstentionist Sinn Fein MPs. “The taoiseach’s problem is that he doesn’t like the democratic choice of the people of ‘those constituencies’ and now makes the ludicrous proposition that there should be another election without Sinn Fein’s participation, taking the democratic choice away from the people.“Sinn Fein representatives have been very active in advancing the rights and interests of people particularly with regard to Brexit.”Brexit: Sammy Wilson will

OK, he and his we have jetted off to Lanzarote to get a break from work, the weather and, of course, the furore over Brexit. Sandra ChapmanHe wouldn’t normally decide to take a break at this time of year. But, as a Brexiteer, he says he has had his fill of politicians, politics and the  promises over Brexit. He says he will be back, but threatens to emigratethe country falls apart.He got a lot of sympathy from Himself who also has flown off this week to the British mainland leaving me with just the dog, which I’m pretty sure is happy to get a bit of peace and quiet from the pair of us who really haven’t been able to argue in any logical fashion about the political crisis surrounding us. Dogs are wonderful at pretending they understand everything you say especiallyyou are saying it near the cupboard where the treats reside.The whole sorry saga of Brexit is impossible to escape.I was about to roll up a page of newspaper to light the fire only to be drawn to the headline at the top: ‘The EU will turn us into captiveswe sign up to this appalling sell-out.’ It was the latest rant in the Dailyfrom Boris Johnson, who wants the Northern Ireland backstop scrapped with both sidesto simply ‘commit to avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland by the use of new unobtrusive checks and discussions of the future economic partnership’ where, he says ‘the Irish discussion rightly belongs’.suitcases packed.That was the day before Sinn Fein’s president Mary Lou McDonald was shouting at the top of her voice about the DUP being out of step on Brexit and ‘must face reality’. Now, I wonder what that reality might be  Seconds later she was urging Arlene Foster to “wake up and smell the coffee”. This is the very same Mary Lou who claims to have “no regrets” over her handling of the Mairia Cahill case. Mary Lou can shout all she wants. Only her own side will be listening.The Northern Ireland born Labour MP for Vauxhall Kate Hoey had a lot to say this week too. Ms Hoey informs us she has “ploughed through” the  pages of the proposed withdrawal agreement plus the explanation notes – that makes her a hero in my eyes – and declares that “Northern Ireland, to all intents and purposes, becomes separated in many ways from the rest of the United Kingdom”, with the backstop arrangements looking like they were written by the Irish government.All in all it means that the Republic of Ireland would, effectively, be representing Northern Ireland in the EU, she believes. A highly respected politician, one not given to exaggeration, I would say she has got it right. That was one page of newspaper I saved from the flames.Then, of course, there are the Scots whose nationalism is getting a fresh kick from the Brexit chaos.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister, accuses Theresa May of asking people to “take a blindfold leap off a clf” with her Brexit deal. Ms Sturgeon, as we all know, has her heart set on independence for Scotland. She may yet be successful second time around. How amazing it is that women are playing such a big role in the whole Brexit saga.Years ago Margaret Thatcher had the political field all to herself. Had she been in charge today she would long ago have hand-bagged Jean-Claude Junker and the elegant Mr Barnier into submission. Theresa May, on the other hand, looks like the one being hand-bagged.Legacy Scandal: The IRA was able to wage terrorism on Castlederg because it was near the safe haven of the Irish Republic Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"So when does this crisis begin to calm down so that the rest of us can get on with planning our Christmas  It’s not looking good.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos about the people you love and the things you care about. Your will helps pass on your principles and the values that matter to you. A gt in your will can ensure that your most loved charities can continue to make a dference for many years to come.Will to Give member USPCA We believe our success in preventing animal cruelty and the relief of suffering is an enduring tribute to those absent friends who shared our valuesEimear McCooey, Will to Give Chair, agreed: ldquoWe plan for lersquos major milestones births, weddings, anniversaries but most of us shy away from talking about and planning for death - yet it is the one thing that is guaranteed to happen to us all!I strongly believe that talking openly about the future can help ensure we have a better experience when it eventually does happen, and one of the things we can plan for is the legacy we want to leave behind.Making a will is important because it gives you the peace of mind of knowing that your wishes will be respected and the ones you love are looked after, whether that be family, friends or even a well-loved charity. I am leaving a small gt to the charities I care for in my will.Will to Give member the USPCA added its appreciation of the value of legacy gts with Brendan Mullan, Chief Executive, explaining:ldquoThe USPCA was established in  and since then the activities of the USPCA have evolved to meet the ever-changing needs of animals.By deciding to leave us a gt in your will you are helping us protect all animals across Northern Ireland.Legacies are extremely important to the USPCA and without these the charity would not be able to deliver our vital services to animals. We believe our success in preventing animal cruelty and the relief of suffering is an enduring tribute to those absent friends who shared our values.Will to Give added: Anyone can leave a gt in their will. It really doesnrsquot matter what size ndash small or large, every gt is greatly received.It is very easy to leave a gt in yourwill to charity ndash in fact, hundreds of people do it every year in Northern Ireland.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”try catch     .               ..

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Christmas1.jpg","title":"thought about the christmas party its just a few weeks away","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business A time for giving, the festive party is an event that puts the spotlight firmly on employer gratitude. Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser.

People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe.

Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come. Don’t think you know everything, as each day you’ll learn something new.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/k11.jpg","title":"kainos sees profits and sales surge","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT firm Kainos has seen a sales and profits surge with revenue rising by % to £.m for the first half of the year. And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
