What about other terminally ill children, the greiving families we know nothing about? What about the seriously ill teenagers and young people at Alder Hey?This case is consuming huge medical and legal resources as (increasingly) parents with terminally ill children (like the tragic case of Charlie Gard at Great Ormand Street) challenge experts and demand the right to intervene.I do not have children, so you might think I can’t speak from experience - but that’s not the case.            The family of terminally ill toddler Alfie Evans have released pictures of the little boy clinging to life in his mother\u0027s arms 10 hours after his life support was removedI married a wonderful man whose 7 year old son had suffered brain damage shortly after birth, a condition that was not immediately spotted by the hospital. My step-son had an operation to reverse the fluid on his brain, but was left with disabilities and learning difficulties.Bunny was a wonderful child, and his condition wasn’t life-threatening - he went to a special school and loved music.Aged 11, he was rushed to hospital with suspected appendicitis - following an exploratory operation the doctors told us he had terminal stomach cancer.He died two weeks later, after the longest fortnight of my life.Unlike Alfie’s mum and dad, my husband and his former partner did not attack the doctors and question their diagnosis, they did not demand surgery (having been told the cancer was too advanced).My job was to comfort and support my husband through this nightmare - with its inevitable painful conclusion.Piers Morgan says that in Alfie’s case ‘love must prevail’ and that the doctors should let the parents do whatever they want.That is nonsensical - this is not a war between right and wrong, and that position implies that doctors will never love a child as much as parents.Doctors take an oath to always act in the best interests of a patient - and Alfie’s interests have been represented separately in court.Alfie’s quality of life is paramount - and for his father to say ‘he’s breathing, he’s not suffering’ yesterday after he was taken off a ventilator is plainly wishful thinking.It denies the hard reality that sometimes a doctor will know your child better than you, and understand medical suffering better than you.If you are truly religious and believe in an afterlife, then you will not fear death and nor should you project fear onto a child.Death is inevitable, and the limited time remaining before Alfie’s death should be a quiet time to celebrate his life and treasure these moments forever, not make plans to whisk him away to another country on a wild goose chase.The hardest thing in the world is to let go, to accept that there’s nothing more you can do except give love.My husband managed to do that - at tremendous cost - and I wish that Tom and Kate could put their child first and do the same."},{"url":null,"title":"Fleetwood Mac tour Tickets dates announced Lindsey Buckinghams departure","story":"Xbox Games with Gold: May 2018 free lineup revealed for Xbox One and 360Kim Kardashian \u0027to appear on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Monday 30 April\u0027When is Mother\u0027s Day in the US?

It was a defensive fortress built by William I (reign, 1066-1087) circa 1086 to guard the Thames valley against any marauding Saxons bold enough to challenge his supremacy. He chose the commanding spot on top of a 100ft cliff overlooking the River Thames which provided easy access to the capital. William first built up a mound of earth to create an artificial hill and then erected a wooden palisade (staked structure) above it. At the base was a ditch, which could be filled with water if necessary, as a defensive measure. Surrounding the base, within the lower walls, was the bailey. Beyond the walls lay several homesteads, which may have acted as a gatehouse, along with several fields for the rearing of livestock. The site had a large staff of servants and defenders and also served as a marketplace for the townspeople, which created growth in the area. The main route from the fort led down to the river for the transportation of goods for trading in London. All that remains of this structure today is the mound on which Windsor Castle\u0027s iconic Round Tower stands          THE CASTLE DURING THE SIEGE OF 1216. The failure by King John (reign, 1199–1216) to honour the commitments set out in the Magna Carta led to civil war. The rebel barons offered the throne of England to Louis, son of Philip II of France, who landed at Sandwich with a French army in May 1216. This drawing shows Windsor Castle during the two-month siege by Louis\u0027s army. By 1100, Henry I had built domestic quarters within the fortress, while his grandson Henry II transformed it into a palace in the late 12th century - including replacing the timber walls with stone. He built two sets of royal apartments - a public residence in the Lower Ward (to the left) and a smaller private residence on the north side of the Upper Ward (right) exclusively for himself. By this stage, walls and towers had also been constructed along the three sides of the upper bailey (the courtyard area seen to the right). Also visible is one of Windsor\u0027s most famous features - the Round Tower crowning the central mount - which was built by Henry II. In addition, the late 12th century gave rise to lodging for the king, a chapel, kitchens and Great Hall          CASTLE DURING THE REIGN OF HENRY III: The reign of Henry III (1216–72) ushered in a richer era in the history of English royal building and court culture. He improved the royal apartments, renovated many of the other buildings and  further fortified the stone walls. Research has shown that much of the Castle\u0027s 12th- and 13th-century masonry, illustrated in this drawing, survives within the present buildings - with St George\u0027s Chapel (seen centre in the Lower Ward section) inside the walls. The chapel was built in the 1240s by the king. From 1222 onwards, extensive work was carried out on the great hall in the outer bailey, the \u0027king\u0027s houses,\u0027 the \u0027houses on the mount,\u0027 and the tower enclosing them. New towers were also built, which were then connected by a strong, curved wall for defence.

This artist\u0027s impression shows the room being prepared for the Garter feast of April 28, 1476, during the reign of Edward IV (1461–83). The room was probably quite plain, but when the court was in residence it was transformed with rich wall hangings, furniture and gold and silver plate. Here, the wall hangings are decorated with the motif of the Order of the Garter, the oldest and most senior Order of Chivalry in Britain, founded by Edward III at Windsor          PAINTED CHAMBER IN THE ROSE TOWER, 1366: Edward III (reign, 1327–77) - the \u0027warrior\u0027 king - is best known for his lengthy campaigns in France during the Hundred Years War. He spent £50,000 transforming Windsor into a Gothic palace, rebuilding the Castle\u0027s Upper Ward to include square towers and high octagonal stair turrets. This illustration shows the small octagonal \u0027Painted Chamber\u0027 of the Rose Tower (today known as King John\u0027s Tower) in Edward III\u0027s day. The colour scheme is based on a surviving fragment of decoration, which suggests that the walls were covered with a pattern of almond-shaped panels containing red, green and gold roses on a red background  Harry and Meghan (left, earlier this week at Westminster Abbey to commemorate Anzac Day) will marry on May 19 at St George\u0027s Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle in Berkshire          The Queen Mother inspects the 300th Anniversary Parade of the Grenadier Guards at Windsor Castle with Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Princess Margaret in 1956Windsor Castle was a favourite residence of Elizabeth I. Hans Eworth\u0027s Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses, 1569, is thought to include the earliest painted representation of the Castle.During the Civil War of 1642–51, the castle was occupied by Parliamentarians and used as a prison to hold Royalist supporters. Prisoners\u0027 graffiti is still visible today in a room above the Norman Gate.Windsor Castle first became a tourist destination between 1714–76, when the court and royal family rarely visited. Visitors came by coach or barge from London to walk along the terraces, view St George\u0027s Chapel and tour the State Apartments led by the Housekeeper. The first guidebook was introduced in 1749.In 1747, the Italian artist Canaletto visited Windsor to record the castle for Sir Hugh Smithson, one of Canaletto\u0027s most important patrons in England.A 1763 inventory of the Round Tower apartments of the castle\u0027s Constable and Governor, the Earl of Cardigan, includes a room for his servant Ignatius Sancho, a composer, actor and writer. Sancho was the first-known Briton of African heritage to vote in a British election and lobbied for abolition of the slave trade.The appearance of the Round Tower dates from the major remodelling of Windsor in the 1820s by George IV. In line with the king’s romantic notion of castle architecture, the tower was heightened by nine metres and given Gothic-style battlements.In June 1887, George Sanger\u0027s travelling circus paraded in the Quadrangle before Queen Victoria and her grandchildren, and gave a performance on the East Lawn. In her journal, the Queen describes 100 horses, 50 ponies, seven elephants, five lions, three camels, a cage of tigers, leopards, a puma, a kangaroo, a monkey, three llamas and an Indian bull.In 1911, Queen Mary persuaded King George V to reintroduce weekly band concerts for the public, which had last taken place at the castle during George III\u0027s reign.In 1924, Queen Mary was presented with a dolls\u0027 house designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens as a gift from the nation. After its display at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, the miniature house was installed permanently at the castle.During the Second World War, the Royal Archives were evacuated from the Round Tower to an underground space beneath the castle known as the South Bowe. In addition to being an official royal residence and one of the principal homes of the Royal Family, Windsor Castle encompasses St George\u0027s Chapel and has been home to the College of St George since 1348. In total, more than 160 people live within the precincts of the Castle as part of a community that has been based there for seven centuries.           Fire broke out at the castle, damaging more than 100 rooms, in November 1992, in a year described by the Queen as her \u0027annus horribilis\u0027                         "},{"url":null,"title":"National Lottery Lotto results Wednesday 25th April","story":"Xbox Games with Gold: May 2018 free lineup revealed for Xbox One and 360Kim Kardashian \u0027to appear on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Monday 30 April\u0027When is Mother\u0027s Day in the US?

She made the Dutch team as a sprinter and her coach, Jan Blankers, who would later become her husband, encouraged her to enter the Berlin 1936 Olympic trials.At 18, Fanny was selected to compete in the high jump and 4x100m relay at the Games but came in fifth place for both events. Here, she met her idol Jesse Owens and got his autograph, which became her most treasured possession.In 1938, Fanny earned her first world record and won international medals resulting in many expecting her to excel in the upcoming Helsinki Olympic Games in 1940. However, with the outbreak of World War II, the competition was cancelled a week before the Netherlands was invaded.Fanny Blankers-Koen  children and husbandBefore WWII, Fanny had become engaged to her coach Jan and on August 29, 1940, the couple were married.At the time, Jan coached the Dutch women’s athletics team and a sports journalist, even though he originally believed that women should not compete in sport. This changed after his feelings towards Fanny changed.After Fanny gave birth to her first child, Jan Junior, in 1941, it was assumed that her career was over, as at the time, it was unusual for female athletes to be married and even more so, to be mothers. As the war went on, she earned six more world records between 1942 and 1944 in athletics.          After Fanny gave birth to Jan Junior in 1941, it was assumed that her sporting career was overNotably in 1943, Fanny improved on her high jump record by 5cm to 1.71m at a special competition in Amsterdam and she tied the 100m world record but this was not formally recognised as she was competing against men when setting the record.The war meant that food was scarce and the winter of 1944-1945, also known as the Hongerwinter, Fanny and other athletes were forced to take a break from competing. However, at the 1946 European Championship, Fanny made a comeback weeks after giving birth to Fanny Junior.Although she received a lot of backlash for competing and not staying home with her children, she continued. She told the New York Times in 1982 that she ‘got very many bad letters, people writing that I must stay home with my children and that I should not be allowed to run on a track with - how do you say it? - short trousers’.British team manager Jack Crump also said that she was ‘too old to make the grade’, unaware that she was actually three months pregnant at the time. At the 1948 Olympics, Fanny won four of nine women’s events: 100m, 80m hurdles, 200m and 4x100m relay and became the first to win four golds in a single Olympics.She became known as the ‘Flying Housewife’, the ‘Flying Dutchmam’ and ‘Amazing Fanny’ by the press and was praised on her return to Amsterdam. Reporters described her style as ‘like she was chasing kids out of the pantry’ and ‘racing to the kitchen to rescue a batch of burning biscuits’.She was paraded around the city in a coach pulled by horses, presented with a bicycle and Queen Juliana made her a knight of the Order of Orange Nassau.          On her return to Amsterdam, Fanny was paraded around the city in a coach pulled by horses, presented with a bicycle and Queen Juliana made her a knight of the Order of Orange NassauFanny Blankers-Koen controversyHowever, after a period of fame and travelling abroad to promote women in sport, a new talent Foekje Dillema emerged and was dubbed the ‘new Fanny’ after she broke the record for 200m.However, tests on cells obtained from her clothing found that Dillema had a Y-chromosome in her DNA and she was possibly a 46XX46XY woman.This deformation is also known as ovotesticular DSD or true hermaphroditism and many believed that this new development was an attempt by Jan and Fanny to eliminate the competition, but these are just rumours.          Foekje Dillema, dubbed the \u0027new Fanny\u0027 seen here shaking hands with Fanny Blankers-KoenFanny Blankers-Koen cause of deathFanny competed in two more Olympic Games and her last ever winning event was the shot put in August 1955, her 58th Dutch title. She also won the 200m by 0.7 second - the highest margin in Olympic 200m history and a record that still stands today.She went on to serve as the Dutch athletics team team leader and after Jan died in 1977, she moved back to her hometown.In 1981, the Fanny Blankers-Koen Games were established and still held annually to this day. She was also commended at a gala in Monaco, organised by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) and was declared the ‘Female Athlete of the Century’.Prior to her death, she suffered from Alzheimer’s disease and lived in a psychiatric nursing home. Fanny died at age 85 in Hoofddorp on January 25, 2004.What is a Google Doodle?In the Google Doodle for April 26, 2018, Fanny Blankers-Koen is honoured on what would have been her 100th birthday and is depicted running ahead of the rest on a track.

What about the seriously ill teenagers and young people at Alder Hey?This case is consuming huge medical and legal resources as (increasingly) parents with terminally ill children (like the tragic case of Charlie Gard at Great Ormand Street) challenge experts and demand the right to intervene.I do not have children, so you might think I can’t speak from experience - but that’s not the case.            The family of terminally ill toddler Alfie Evans have released pictures of the little boy clinging to life in his mother\u0027s arms 10 hours after his life support was removedI married a wonderful man whose 7 year old son had suffered brain damage shortly after birth, a condition that was not immediately spotted by the hospital. My step-son had an operation to reverse the fluid on his brain, but was left with disabilities and learning difficulties.Bunny was a wonderful child, and his condition wasn’t life-threatening - he went to a special school and loved music.Aged 11, he was rushed to hospital with suspected appendicitis - following an exploratory operation the doctors told us he had terminal stomach cancer.He died two weeks later, after the longest fortnight of my life.Unlike Alfie’s mum and dad, my husband and his former partner did not attack the doctors and question their diagnosis, they did not demand surgery (having been told the cancer was too advanced).My job was to comfort and support my husband through this nightmare - with its inevitable painful conclusion.Piers Morgan says that in Alfie’s case ‘love must prevail’ and that the doctors should let the parents do whatever they want.That is nonsensical - this is not a war between right and wrong, and that position implies that doctors will never love a child as much as parents.Doctors take an oath to always act in the best interests of a patient - and Alfie’s interests have been represented separately in court.Alfie’s quality of life is paramount - and for his father to say ‘he’s breathing, he’s not suffering’ yesterday after he was taken off a ventilator is plainly wishful thinking.It denies the hard reality that sometimes a doctor will know your child better than you, and understand medical suffering better than you.If you are truly religious and believe in an afterlife, then you will not fear death and nor should you project fear onto a child.Death is inevitable, and the limited time remaining before Alfie’s death should be a quiet time to celebrate his life and treasure these moments forever, not make plans to whisk him away to another country on a wild goose chase.The hardest thing in the world is to let go, to accept that there’s nothing more you can do except give love.My husband managed to do that - at tremendous cost - and I wish that Tom and Kate could put their child first and do the same."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/25/21/4B8E60C700000578-0-image-a-24_1524688358911.jpg","title":"Windsor Castle ages","story":"    WINDSOR CASTLE IN ITS EARLIEST FORM, 1086: This illustration shows Windsor as a motte-and-bailey castle - \u0027motte\u0027 being a mound, and \u0027bailey\u0027 an enclosed courtyard. It was a defensive fortress built by William I (reign, 1066-1087) circa 1086 to guard the Thames valley against any marauding Saxons bold enough to challenge his supremacy. He chose the commanding spot on top of a 100ft cliff overlooking the River Thames which provided easy access to the capital. William first built up a mound of earth to create an artificial hill and then erected a wooden palisade (staked structure) above it. At the base was a ditch, which could be filled with water if necessary, as a defensive measure. Surrounding the base, within the lower walls, was the bailey. Beyond the walls lay several homesteads, which may have acted as a gatehouse, along with several fields for the rearing of livestock. The site had a large staff of servants and defenders and also served as a marketplace for the townspeople, which created growth in the area. The main route from the fort led down to the river for the transportation of goods for trading in London. All that remains of this structure today is the mound on which Windsor Castle\u0027s iconic Round Tower stands          THE CASTLE DURING THE SIEGE OF 1216. The failure by King John (reign, 1199–1216) to honour the commitments set out in the Magna Carta led to civil war. The rebel barons offered the throne of England to Louis, son of Philip II of France, who landed at Sandwich with a French army in May 1216. This drawing shows Windsor Castle during the two-month siege by Louis\u0027s army. By 1100, Henry I had built domestic quarters within the fortress, while his grandson Henry II transformed it into a palace in the late 12th century - including replacing the timber walls with stone. He built two sets of royal apartments - a public residence in the Lower Ward (to the left) and a smaller private residence on the north side of the Upper Ward (right) exclusively for himself. By this stage, walls and towers had also been constructed along the three sides of the upper bailey (the courtyard area seen to the right). Also visible is one of Windsor\u0027s most famous features - the Round Tower crowning the central mount - which was built by Henry II. In addition, the late 12th century gave rise to lodging for the king, a chapel, kitchens and Great Hall          CASTLE DURING THE REIGN OF HENRY III: The reign of Henry III (1216–72) ushered in a richer era in the history of English royal building and court culture. He improved the royal apartments, renovated many of the other buildings and  further fortified the stone walls. Research has shown that much of the Castle\u0027s 12th- and 13th-century masonry, illustrated in this drawing, survives within the present buildings - with St George\u0027s Chapel (seen centre in the Lower Ward section) inside the walls. The chapel was built in the 1240s by the king. From 1222 onwards, extensive work was carried out on the great hall in the outer bailey, the \u0027king\u0027s houses,\u0027 the \u0027houses on the mount,\u0027 and the tower enclosing them. New towers were also built, which were then connected by a strong, curved wall for defence.

This artist\u0027s impression shows the room being prepared for the Garter feast of April 28, 1476, during the reign of Edward IV (1461–83). The room was probably quite plain, but when the court was in residence it was transformed with rich wall hangings, furniture and gold and silver plate. Here, the wall hangings are decorated with the motif of the Order of the Garter, the oldest and most senior Order of Chivalry in Britain, founded by Edward III at Windsor          PAINTED CHAMBER IN THE ROSE TOWER, 1366: Edward III (reign, 1327–77) - the \u0027warrior\u0027 king - is best known for his lengthy campaigns in France during the Hundred Years War. He spent £50,000 transforming Windsor into a Gothic palace, rebuilding the Castle\u0027s Upper Ward to include square towers and high octagonal stair turrets. This illustration shows the small octagonal \u0027Painted Chamber\u0027 of the Rose Tower (today known as King John\u0027s Tower) in Edward III\u0027s day. The colour scheme is based on a surviving fragment of decoration, which suggests that the walls were covered with a pattern of almond-shaped panels containing red, green and gold roses on a red background  Harry and Meghan (left, earlier this week at Westminster Abbey to commemorate Anzac Day) will marry on May 19 at St George\u0027s Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle in Berkshire          The Queen Mother inspects the 300th Anniversary Parade of the Grenadier Guards at Windsor Castle with Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Princess Margaret in 1956Windsor Castle was a favourite residence of Elizabeth I. Hans Eworth\u0027s Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses, 1569, is thought to include the earliest painted representation of the Castle.During the Civil War of 1642–51, the castle was occupied by Parliamentarians and used as a prison to hold Royalist supporters. Prisoners\u0027 graffiti is still visible today in a room above the Norman Gate.Windsor Castle first became a tourist destination between 1714–76, when the court and royal family rarely visited. Visitors came by coach or barge from London to walk along the terraces, view St George\u0027s Chapel and tour the State Apartments led by the Housekeeper. The first guidebook was introduced in 1749.In 1747, the Italian artist Canaletto visited Windsor to record the castle for Sir Hugh Smithson, one of Canaletto\u0027s most important patrons in England.A 1763 inventory of the Round Tower apartments of the castle\u0027s Constable and Governor, the Earl of Cardigan, includes a room for his servant Ignatius Sancho, a composer, actor and writer. Sancho was the first-known Briton of African heritage to vote in a British election and lobbied for abolition of the slave trade.The appearance of the Round Tower dates from the major remodelling of Windsor in the 1820s by George IV. In line with the king’s romantic notion of castle architecture, the tower was heightened by nine metres and given Gothic-style battlements.In June 1887, George Sanger\u0027s travelling circus paraded in the Quadrangle before Queen Victoria and her grandchildren, and gave a performance on the East Lawn. In her journal, the Queen describes 100 horses, 50 ponies, seven elephants, five lions, three camels, a cage of tigers, leopards, a puma, a kangaroo, a monkey, three llamas and an Indian bull.In 1911, Queen Mary persuaded King George V to reintroduce weekly band concerts for the public, which had last taken place at the castle during George III\u0027s reign.In 1924, Queen Mary was presented with a dolls\u0027 house designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens as a gift from the nation. After its display at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, the miniature house was installed permanently at the castle.During the Second World War, the Royal Archives were evacuated from the Round Tower to an underground space beneath the castle known as the South Bowe. In addition to being an official royal residence and one of the principal homes of the Royal Family, Windsor Castle encompasses St George\u0027s Chapel and has been home to the College of St George since 1348. In total, more than 160 people live within the precincts of the Castle as part of a community that has been based there for seven centuries.           Fire broke out at the castle, damaging more than 100 rooms, in November 1992, in a year described by the Queen as her \u0027annus horribilis\u0027                         "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/26/11/4B92BD9900000578-5659633-The_coach_driver_continues_down_the_road_with_the_Bentley_follow-m-16_1524738832891.jpg","title":"Idiot Bentley driver overtakes coach zebra crossing people it","story":"    Dashcam footage filmed on a 40-tonne coach shows the pricey motor\u0027s \u0027idiot\u0027 driver attempt to cut in front of the huge vehicle just seconds before the brazen overtake          The coach driver continues down the road with the Bentley following up the rear as they approach a pedestrian crossingPolice cars give two people riding on a 8mph mobility...Terrifying decision to overtake leaves truck driver shocked...Terrifying dashcam footage shows two death-wish drivers...Share this article\u0027I hit my brakes and horn and he obviously decided he wouldn\u0027t make it (which he wouldn\u0027t have) and stopped before hitting the side of the coach or mounting the pavement.\u0027 As the coach stops to allow two men to cross a pedestrian crossing, the impatient Bentley driver is seen zooming across on the wrong side of the road.           Two men then cross over the road as the coach driver waits patiently at the crossing           The \u0027idiotic\u0027 Bentley driver then overtakes on the wrong side of the road across the pedestrian crossing           Despite the \u0027unbelievable\u0027 manoeuvre, the Bentley driver is no further ahead in traffic and is still stuck behind the blue 4x4\u0027He decides to drive on the opposite side of the road, the wrong side of the central reservation and into oncoming traffic at speed nearly causing an accident,\u0027 the coach driver added. \u0027He then swerves in front of the 4x4 and into an active bus lane.\u0027Despite the \u0027unbelievable\u0027 manoeuvre, the Bentley driver is no further ahead in traffic and is still stuck behind the blue 4x4."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/26/12/4B88960D00000578-5659893-The_mother_uses_a_shovel_in_a_bid_to_fend_of_the_angry_bird_s_fe-a-34_1524743196313.jpg","title":"Mother defend giant bird shovel","story":"The furious bird charged at Heather Waddington while she was inside its pen in Helmshore, Lancashire          The mother uses a shovel in a bid to fend of the angry bird\u0027s feathery onslaught as it chases her around its enclosure Ms Waddington, from Baxenden, Lancashire, said: \u0027When I saw the bird coming after me, I s**t myself.

The weak pound, which is a boon for these firms, has helped the index of bluechip British shares rise by almost 400 points over the past month. Fears over a potential trade war between China and the US rattled markets earlier in the month but a softer tone from Donald Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has placated investors.The spectre of a damaging global trade war triggered by Donald Trump could dent the ambition of leading Brexiters to strike free trade deals with the rest of the world after the UK leaves the EU. For now, despite the warning signs, there was better news last month in the narrowing UK trade deficit. The trade deficit highlights the difference between what Britain sells abroad and what it imports. In February, this narrowed to £10.2bn, down from £12.2bn in January. There were signs that the freezing weather and heavy snow early last month brought the UK economy to a standstill, raising questions over whether the Bank of England would raise interest rates in May. Barometers of business activity in the construction and services sectors fell sharply, with the latter recording the worst month for activity since the Brexit vote. The IHS MarkitCIPS all sector purchasing managers’ index fell to 52.1, down from 54.2 on a gauge where a reading of 50 splits the difference between expansion and contraction. As a result, economists are forecasting a fall in economic growth for the first quarter of 2018 by about half from the final months of last year. Philip Hammond received good news from the public finances last month, with figures showing the UK budget deficit had narrowed to the lowest annual level since the financial crisis. According to the ONS, public sector net borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, fell by £3.5bn to £42.6bn in the last financial year – making 2017-18 the best year for the budget deficit since the year ending March 2007. The shortfall between how much the government spends and what it receives from taxes was £2.6bn lower than forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility. Meanwhile, the chancellor had hinted during the spring statement he could raise spending in the autumn budget should the public finances remain on track. Brexit uncertainty is weighing heavily on the UK property market, where house price growth has slowed across the country and in reverse in London. The latest snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) showed demand from buyers fell for the 12th consecutive month in March, coupled with the seventh month in a row for fewer new instructions from sellers. Meanwhile, official figures from the ONS showed the first annual fall for house prices in London since the depths of the last recession in 2009.

Deluded. Emotive nonsense. These are unusually strong terms for a judge to use, particularly in a case as intensely sad and bitterly contested as that of the terminally ill child Alfie Evans. Yet Mr Justice Hayden, referring to some of the campaigners now surrounding Alfie’s parents, did not mince his words, after this most hellish of ethical dilemmas ended this week in a court ruling that the child’s ventilator be switched off against the family’s\u0026nbspwishes.The judge was careful not to attach blame to Tom Evans and Kate James, who cannot accept the settled view of their son’s doctors that his brain has been damaged catastrophically by an as yet undiagnosed condition, or that the intensive treatment required to keep him alive is no longer in his best interest and may be causing him suffering.Alfie’s parents have fought like tigers both in and out of court and no parent – even those whose sympathies in this case are with the doctors facing death threats for doing what they honestly believe is the right thing – will begrudge the family their right to clutch in their grief at every straw there is.But the high court judge is surely right to question the motives of some of those extending straws. The most disturbing aspect of this case is the sense that it is now being exploited by those who see Alfie not as a desperately sick little boy, but as an expedient means of advancing their own ideological cause.That description doesn’t just apply to the pro-life movement, of course. Among Alfie’s viscerally engaged army of Facebook supporters, which includes many parents of small children, you will find anti-vaxxers using the story to peddle utterly deluded junk science theories about the Vitamin K injection every newborn gets. You’ll find American gun lobby enthusiasts ranting on about how this is what happens when “the government” runs people’s lives and that’s why everyone needs to keep hold of their weapons never mind that this decision has nothing to do with the government, resting as it does on the independent judgment of doctors upheld by an independent judiciary.Others have sought to use the case to score cheap, wildly inaccurate points over healthcare reform in the US to claim this is where “socialised medicine” gets you, when without the NHS and its daily miracle of providing treatment free at the point of use, Alfie’s parents would now be struggling with medical bills running into the millions.And where far-right conspiracy sites such as Infowars and Breitbart rush in, an army of trolls inevitably follows. Staff at Alder Hey children’s hospital have experienced a horrific barrage of death threats and other online abuse. There have been ugly scenes at the hospital too, reports of over-zealous protesters blocking ambulances or intimidating visitors and patients. It is all too uncomfortably reminiscent of those who harass pregnant women outside abortion clinics and threaten to kill doctors offering terminations, so high on their self-righteous mission to save that all other human lives cease to matter.But none of that is quite what the judge meant. His concern centres specifically on the way the Evans family has been taken under the wing of a hitherto little-known evangelical group called the Christian Legal Centre, which has supplied the parents with a barrister and, somewhat dubiously, the services of a law student named Pavel Stroilov. A statement drafted for Alfie’s father was, according to Hayden, loaded with “vituperation and bile” against the hospital, which had not helped the baby’s case. At one point, Stroilov apparently became party to an attempt by Alfie’s father to have the doctors prosecuted for murder.The family’s former solicitor Mary Holmes has accused activists of seeking to “keep this child alive at any costs and not for the right reasons”, using the case to raise their profile with interventions such as securing Tom Evans an audience with the pope. Most seriously, Stroilov stands accused of giving Evans inaccurate advice in a letter stating that he had the legal right to remove his son from the hospital, despite a court order to the contrary, causing an understandably emotional standoff between the parents and the hospital when it became clear that was not the case. What is compassionate or Christian about giving a desperate man false hope?The judge’s objection to an outpouring of what he called “emotive nonsense” in his courtroom is not to be confused with heartlessness. Rather, it is a recognition that courts are the one place where, in cases like these, reason can still prevail over white-hot emotion that their job is to provide a calm enough environment for doctors facing impossibly difficult choices to explain their clinical reasoning, and for evidence to be considered on its merits. For in British law, what matters is what is in the best interest of the child, not of the parents or the doctors or wider public opinion, and certainly not of organised religion. The court process functions only when the adults involved can be mature enough to put their own interests to one side, which means lawyers in such cases acting as advocates for their clients – not campaigners advancing their own beliefs.And while advocacy may mean fighting to the bitter end, there are times when it means gently introducing a client to the idea that it is time to stop that however unreconciled they are to a painful verdict, it isn’t going to change. It is a conversation that would be familiar, ironically enough, not only to doctors but to priests.The church’s role can be to give hope where secular medicine has none. Light a candle, say a prayer, and just for a minute you might believe in a miracle. Yet that is not its only role at the end of life, when the dying and the grieving are looking as much for comfort as for hope and for help in accepting the inevitable with grace. As Psalm 23: 4 has it, “Yea, though I walk through the shadows of the valley of death, I will fear no evil for thou art with me.” This family is walking through the shadows of that valley now, and they deserve to be accompanied by people with only their best interests at heart. May they find the comfort and grace they deserve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37815adb76d18772e549176435733cb9ef6d3e01/0_0_650_395/master/650.jpg?w=645\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=25cfa5d9744214dc7497246b93e56ee4 1290w","title":"youre the one that i want grease inspired summer fashion in pictures","story":"Celebrating its 40th anniversary, Grease is still lightning in the style stakes – as these chic Rydell High School-inspired outfits attest"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ca1335753d8a7de4a83c8ad6783b402c2ee6757/0_95_2979_1788/master/2979.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86d6b893b17453931e6ca3269de029be","title":"fa sale wembley stadium shahid khan sign of the times","story":"Times change and the idea of an overseas billionaire taking over is now being seen as a workable solution to the FA’s money problemsThe Football Association’s proposed sale of Wembley stadium to the US car parts billionaire Shahid Khan was not greeted by a widespread shriek of patriotic indignation, perhaps illustrating how accustomed British people are now to crown jewels being sold overseas. Liverpool, thrillingly reconnecting with their European Cup-winning heritage and rampaging towards the Champions\u0026nbspLeague final, are owned by US sports franchise billionaires, as are Manchester United, Arsenal and other grand clubs including Fulham, which Khan, owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars NFL team, bought from Mohamed Al Fayed in\u0026nbsp2013.Fayed sold his other London landmark, Harrods, to Qatari state funds, which also owns the Shard and many prestigious chunks of the West End. The Premier League champions and large tracts of east Manchester are owned by the Abu Dhabi ruling family after decades in which no British investors could be found to arrest economic decline.At the same time, government investment in its own public responsibilities has been relentlessly cut, with sports facilities, swimming pools, public parks and playing fields inevitably falling victim. Before the 2010 general election, the then shadow Conservative sports minister, Hugh Robertson, expressed displeasure at a  article in which the Labour sports minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, proudly presented his government’s record of investment in school and public sports facilities and warned that the Tories would initiate cuts. Eight years on, as Sutcliffe predicted, hundreds of millions of pounds have been scythed from local authority budgets now struggling to maintain existing sports facilities, let alone modernise or build new ones.This is the context to the FA’s acknowledgement that it is considering a £500m-plus proposal from Khan to buy Wembley, and presenting it as a positive plan because it would spend the money on improving grassroots facilities. The new Wembley was built for £757m after serious financial difficulties, after the FA took ownership because its England matches and FA Cup semi-finals and finals provide the bulk of the income, and it has been a financial and administrative burden. Eleven years since the stadium finally reopened, with its new arch, 90,000 seats, Bobby Moore statue and girth of Club Wembley Club Wembley corporate feasting, the FA still owes £140m and Wembley makes a loss after paying the interest.The FA’s own history since it took charge of the Wembley project in 1999 has been turbulent, working through a series of chairmen and chief executives and repeatedly coming off worse in battles for governance authority with the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Scudamore. Gradually, however, the FA has focused more on the abject conditions in which the public has to play football and begun to explore the potential for improving\u0026nbspthings.Hence this proposed deal to sell Wembley and the FA’s careful presentation of it as an opportunity to release substantial, transformational money for public\u0026nbsp facilities.The argument is that having sweated for years to pay off the enormous debt on the new stadium, the FA has a prime asset in north London, still sucking in time and effort and whose value could be put to better use. If Khan, who has nursed a long-term project to bring the NFL and his Jaguars franchise more regularly to Wembley, were to buy it, the £500m-plus would be released for good works. This commitment at the outset of negotiations, that the bulk of the millions will go towards upgrading facilities, is the promise to which the FA must be held and against which it should be judged.The FA is making it clear it will still look to earn valuable money from playing matches at Wembley, retaining the Club Wembley receipts. In its most recently published accounts, for the year to 31 July 2016, the FA recorded £56.5m revenue from Club Wembley, 10-year packages having been sold to City firms and other corporate clients from the stadium’s opening. Last year Club Wembley packages were revamped to provide more luxury, reduce tenures to three seasons, and prices are now running from £2,148 for a seat per season to £11,064 in the One Twenty club and £37,200 – per person, per seat – in a private box.The FA is saying it will retain all this income and revert to playing matches on the basis it used to and on which most national teams do: pay rent to use the stadium and keep the money from the tickets. Khan will buy out the stadium itself, take the food and beverage revenue from the rest of it, and take on the burden of its\u0026nbspupkeep.The public money provided for Wembley’s rebuilding and the infrastructure around it: £79m from Sport England, £18m from the government, £17m from the London Development Agency and further smaller amounts making a total of £119m, will have to be repaid or an accommodation reached.For Khan, the attraction appears to be expanding the NFL into London and ensuring the Jaguars have pre-eminent rights to be the team who play there. While the NFL season is on, from September to January, the FA has accepted that England matches will not be played at Wembley and move around major club grounds instead, a prospect many fans are likely to welcome.During those months, traditionalists might avert their gaze from the goings-on within England’s national football stadium. But it is a sign of the times that the FA’s proposal itself is being entertained as a potentially workable idea to husband scarce resources, rather than dismissed with a cry of betrayal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/350b7ecf44405b86d737024f955312d9f0c176c1/0_116_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e9d9b78f76d42148aea5e85bd74c866","title":"fa sell wembley fulham owner shahid khan","story":"The Football Association is poised to sell Wembley stadium to the billionaire owner of Fulham football club in an extraordinary deal worth almost £900m.Shahid Khan, who also owns the Jacksonville Jaguars American football team, has made an offer of a £600m lump sum and the FA would additionally be allowed to retain the revenue generated by Club Wembley, its debenture and hospitality business valued at around £300m.The proposed deal has been in the pipeline for more than 12 months after Khan met the FA chief executive, Martin Glenn, at the Superbowl in February last year, and it was presented to the FA board on Thursday. They are on the brink of accepting, pending due diligence and the approval of the public bodies who contributed to the stadium’s iconic redesign. Khan told the  he hoped the deal would be completed in two to three months.The Department of Culture Media and Sport, Sport England and the Greater London Authority combined to contribute £161m to the construction of the £757m stadium in north London, which reopened in 2007.It is understood the governing body would plough the profits from the deal into grassroots football, particularly increasing the numbers of pitches and their functionality. It has an outstanding debt of £140m on Wembley to pay off. An extra £460m would hypothetically pay for more than 1,000 new pitches and allow for improved facilities countrywide, including floodlights and better drainage.However Downing Street sounded a note of caution about the sale, saying the FA should consult fans.“Wembley is a historic place in English football, it holds a very special place in the heart of fans up and down the country and I’m sure the FA will want to strongly consider the views of these supporters before deciding what to do next,” the prime minister’s spokesman said.Some fans expressed concerns about the stadium being privately owned and the possibility of a renaming including an American brand.Khan stressed that Wembley would continue to be the main home of the England football team and that the “Wembley” part of the name would remain, with the possibility of a sponsor being added. But the deal would send the national team on the road for any internationals between September and December if the Jacksonville Jaguars, usually based in Florida, take up residency for the full regular season.Khan, who is estimated to have amassed a £5.2bn fortune from a car parts business, told the  he envisaged making upgrades to the stadium. “I love Wembley as a stadium, as an institution,” he said. “I think it’s under-utilised. The legacy of Wembley as the temple of English football is important. We want it to stay that way and to also have other events including NFL games. I think it needs investment and updating. Compared to American stadiums the video boards are something that need to be looked at. The lounges are a little bit dated. There are some standard issues that have to be dealt with.”“But the name of Wembley will stay,” he added. “That is, to me, holy.”Khan already has an agreement whereby one Jaguars game each season is held at Wembley and he insisted that initially it would be only two games per season in London. Sources close to Khan also insisted that the FA Cup final, the English Football League play-off finals and Rugby League’s Challenge Cup final would remain at Wembley.The FA believes England fans would welcome more internationals being played in other parts of the country, with one of the warm-up matches for this summer’s World Cup being held in Leeds. Khan did not rule out bidding for Wembley to host the Superbowl. “I think Wembley is in a league of its own,” he said. “It’s not a stadium that is identified with one particular team or one particular event.”A sale could scupper plans Chelsea have to redevelop their Stamford Bridge home. Their project involves knocking down the ground and the hotels and other buildings on the site, a redevelopment which would force them to to find a temporary home for at least three seasons.The Labour shadow sports minister, Rosena Allin-Khan, urged the FA to be cautious about selling immediately. “Wembley stadium is an iconic sporting and cultural asset recognised around the globe,” she said. “Whilst there are obvious benefits of England teams playing across the nation, the FA should not rush into any deal to sell the stadium. Any deal must guarantee that England continue to play at Wembley as well as around the country that major tournaments, cup finals and play-offs for multiple sports are still held at Wembley and that ticket prices for England games are frozen for 10 years. The FA needs to guarantee that profits of the sale will be put into grassroots football to ensure that future generations will benefit.”Khan, in addition to his plans for Wembley, has committed to spending £100m to redevelop Fulham’s stadium. Hammersmith \u0026amp Fulham council has approved a £100m redevelopment of the Riverside Stand at Craven Cottage, with work due to begin next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7d49d62e09458ef2100ca1473fa5d8f46c04a75/78_35_4266_2559/master/4266.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=deb33ec76319903b3302c42a49832ed1","title":"liverpool roma uefa rome officials meeting fans security","story":"Liverpool have taken the unprecedented step of organising a meeting with Uefa, Roma and the Italian authorities in Rome on Friday over serious security concerns for their Champions League semi-final at the Stadio Olimpico.A delegation from Liverpool will meet officials from European football’s governing body, the club’s Champions League opponents, police and council members in Rome having been frustrated in attempts to gather what they consider basic information for supporters travelling to the second leg next Wednesday.Talks began when the semi-final draw was made on 13\u0026nbspApril. A fortnight later several security matters have not been addressed, prompting Liverpool’s request for Friday’s meeting. Events at Anfield on Tuesday, when a 53-year-old Liverpool supporter was seriously assaulted outside the stadium by Roma fans, have heightened the club’s concerns. The supporter, Sean Cox, remains in a critical condition.Liverpool have sold 5,000 away tickets and usually provide fans with guidance on security and safety issues at the point of sale. That information is provided by the opposition club but a complication is that Roma do not own their stadium. The relevant authorities – the local council and security services – have not addressed several matters raised by Liverpool, Roma and Uefa.They include: the provision of a safe and secure shuttle bus service to and from the Stadio Olimpico for the 5,000 away supporters (Liverpool have offered to subsidise the additional transport costs) what time Liverpool fans can arrive at and enter the stadium whether bags are allowed in the stadium (many fans will be arriving on day trips) areas of the city to be avoided and routes to take to the stadium if the shuttle service is not provided.An additional concern is the enforcement procedure for fans with tickets that do not correspond with their names and what will happen to fans if refused entry. According to Italian regulations ticket-holders must have their name on the ticket. Liverpool are concerned this could lead to a build-up of fans outside a stadium that has narrow entrances and a bottle neck in certain areas. Supporters without tickets will be advised not to travel in keeping with standard Liverpool policy.A Liverpool statement said the club “is continuing to do everything in its power to provide supporters travelling to Rome next week with the most comprehensive safety and security advice, adding: “The club has taken the exceptional measure of requesting an extraordinary meeting in the Italian capital, which will take place on Friday.“Present at the meeting will be all the major stakeholders, who share responsibility for the wellbeing of Liverpool supporters making the journey to watch the Champions League tie. At the behest of Liverpool, club officials will join Roma, Uefa and the relevant Italian police and security services to discuss specific concerns.“Liverpool have sought clarity on a number of issues surrounding the match-day operation since the draw was made and is hoping this extraordinary meeting will provide the necessary reassurances and essential information. This, if provided, will allow the club to fully inform supporters of the measures that will be in place. The club thanks its fans for their engagement on this issue and would hope to provide a detailed update following the meeting.”Liverpool know from experience the security problems that surround a game at Roma while fans of Manchester United, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Middlesbrough have all been targeted in the Italian capital in recent years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da857de8c701de83f3b0a00e2df4cc47675b01cd/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7889d50affbafaa6c0e771f6e03d0d1e 1400w","title":"arsenal v atletico madrid europa league semi final first leg live","story":"71 mins: Another corner is punched clear by Oblack.

They’ve scored a goal! Inevitably, there’s a one-two in the build-up. It plays Wilshere into space on the left of the area but forces him wide. Still, he plays a lovely cross to the back post and Lacazette heads down and in!58 mins: From Welbeck’s left-wing cross the ball drops to Ramsey, four yards out. From that position you’d expect a goal nine times out of 10, but on this occasion the space between him and goal is entirely full of yellow shirts, so he doesn’t even shoot.56 mins: Atlético are playing 4-4-1, and the one – Gameiro – is standing 10 yards outside his penalty area.55 mins: Monreal’s low cross is kicked clear, he wins it back and then his high cross is headed clear. “Few teams can have a sustained spell of possession in the opposition penalty area and not look like scoring the way Arsenal can,” notes Dave Seare.53 mins: Ramsey’s 20-yarder presents Oblak with an easy save. Arsenal don’t seem to have any particular plan to break down this defence, so will just keep on running to the edge of the area and then trying a one-two until one of them falls over.51 mins: Hernandez runs past Xhaka and goes down, and the two players put their heads together angrily afterwards. Hernandez was brushed by Xhaka’s hand, but then carried on for a few strides before flinging himself to the floor. The referee tells them both to grow up.48 mins: Good build-up play by Arsenal, but the move ends with Welbeck, stretching, massively overhitting his cross.47 mins: In the other semi-final, by the way, Marseille lead 1-0. Thauvin scored after 15 minutes or so.Atlético, though, are fantastically organised. Welbeck, coming off the left, has come close a couple of times, but despite the numerical disadvantage the visitors have been fairly comfortable, and made one excellent chance of their own.“As a referee (at much lower levels) Clement Turpin is my new hero,” writes Rick McGahey. “Players think they can get away with harsh fouls early in the match (as Sergio Ramos often does, and did yesterday) because refs won’t call them. But Turpin was spot on. If more refs had Turpin’s sense and courage, games would be better behaved.”“I’m neither an Atletico nor Arsenal fan,” writes Chris Mac. “However, I can’t bear to see a red card so early in the game at this level of European football. Instead of watching an anticipated end-to-end wonderful game, I’m forced to watch 80 minutes of a one-sided boring game regardless of the result. Politics of football is ruining this once upon a time beautiful and fair sport. Somebody, somewhere is rooting for Wenger to finish on a high note. And they call me a conspiracy nut!” Yes, I wonder why they do that.A guy who flew into two poor challenges was shown two yellow cards. The players have tried to make Clément Turpin’s life extremely difficult, and he’s made a succession of good decisions. He’s the man of the match so far.45+3 mins: Shots, saves, red cards, we’ve had it all. Except goals. 45+2 mins: Atlético take a full minute over a throw-in.45+1 mins: Into stoppage time, of which there’ll be a couple of minutes. Arsenal win a corner, which ends up with Ramsey, beyond the far post, who chests down and volleys into a defender.44 mins: Atlético continue to worry Arsenal. Gameiro passes to Correa on the left, and he shoots over the bar.43 mins: Arsenal tap the ball around the edge of the area for a while before giving it away. Then Xhaka nudges Griezmann in the thigh, and he flings himself to the turf and rolls around for a while. Oi, Griezmann, me no like.42 mins: Lacazette has moved to the left, and Welbeck to the middle. This allowed Lacazette to take Ospina’s fine, long pass and then overhit his significantly simpler one to Welbeck.40 mins: The free kick is pumped into the area, headed back across goal, and finally towards goal by Gameiro. Ospina’s save is fairly straightforward.39 mins: Mustafi touches Griezmann’s shoulder, and Griezmann flings himself to the turf clutching his face. The referee gives a free-kick, but keeps his cards in his pocket.37 mins: What a save by Ospina! And what a chance for Atlético! Partey took the ball in midfield, ran into the area – via a lucky rebound or two – and nudged to Griezmann, who blasted at goal, but it was pushed away!36 mins: The number of Arsenal fans currently emailing to say something along the lines of, “This has 0-1 written all over it” is a little surprising. Where’s your hopeless optimism? Could happen, mind.33 mins: Atlético have a shot! Griezmann takes it, from the edge of the area, but it’s a straightforward save for Ospina.32 mins: Now for a game of spot the Labour leader. He’s wisely eschewing the hand gestures.31 mins: Another chance! Ramsey’s cross is flicked on by Lacazette, and Monreal lashes a volley across goal and, with Oblak beaten, wide!28 mins: Ramsey flies in to win the ball just ahead of Correa, who goes over his leg and rolls around for a while. The referee tells him to get up, another good decision.27 mins: Lacazette tricks himself into space in the penalty area, but strangely Arsenal have nobody in the penalty area except Wilshere, who doesn’t seem keen to contest a header against Godin, and the move peters out.27 mins: “That second yellow was harsh,” writes Duderonomy. “Waiting for the ref to celebrate an Arsenal goal by ripping off his shirt to reveal a white-tee emblazoned with ‘WENGER IN’.” I think the first yellow was slightly harsh, but the second was obvious.25 mins: Özil’s curler from 20 yards or so floats harmlessly wide.23 mins: Lacazette has the ball in the penalty area. Godin is at his back. Lacazette dances around for a while and then es over Godin’s foot. The striker was looking for that, created what contact there was, and could have been booked for simulation.22 mins: And another chance! The corner is flicked on and flies to Koscielny, beyond the far post, who volleys wildly wide.21 mins: Save! Welbeck plays a one-two with Wilshere and runs into space to the left of goal, but his attempt to curl across goal is too close to Oblak.19 mins: And another chance for Arsenal! They make about half a dozen final passes there, only for each player to decide the move deserves another final pass. Eventually it’s chipped across the area to Wilshere, whose header is weak."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2fccf2278a3c3a7cff07d403bafd00c4e25626f/603_581_3553_2132/master/3553.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24a978b717bdb19ea60fb40c1f133166","title":"is it weird to eat the same sandwich for lunch every day","story":"Housing minister Dominic Raab’s food habits have sparked debate, but surveys show UK workers are repetitive eatersDid you eat the same thing for today’s lunch at work that you ate yesterday? We ask because a detail about sandwiches was one of the odder elements of a story about a Westminster security alert. A woman accused of meeting men via a “sugar daddy” website while working for parliament told the Daily Mirror that the housing minister, Dominic Raab, has exactly the same thing for lunch every day: a Pret a Manger chicken caesar and bacon baguette, with a pot of fruit and the same smoothie.But is this really that unusual?The statistics we have on how people choose to eat lunch at work are usually gathered by surveys, which can be unreliable, but all the indicators are that a significant proportion of the UK workforce eat the same thing for lunch every day. Whole Foods Market carried out a similar exercise four years earlier. It found that a third of Britons ate the same lunch daily, and half said they had been doing so for six years. Cheese sandwiches and ham sandwiches are apparently the favourites of a nation stuck in a lunchtime rut.There are upsides to repetitive eating. There’s a theory that because you become subconsciously bored of the meal, you eat smaller portions as a result. It can also help with budgeting: those purchasing the same thing each day can anticipate exactly how much they are going to spend on lunches. Another reason to stick to what you know might be to do with allergies – repeatedly ordering the same thing avoids the risk of unexpected ingredients. This may not be the case with Raab’s sandwich, however, since it contains seven items listed by Pret as possible allergens: gluten, sesame seeds, dairy, egg, celery, mustard and fish.Still, regardless of what you have for lunch at work, your habits will never be as eyebrow-raising as the man who claims he eats Christmas dinner every single day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8908436488bf99f8f3659b3ecfc42a57d3626829/892_1454_6214_3728/master/6214.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=704f47910abfed3ef413be0dbe1a98c0","title":"no stir risotto recipe felicity cloake masterclass","story":"Think risotto is all about endless stirring? Think again…I’m going to let you in on a little secret: despite what every nonna and Italian cookbook will tell you, you don’t need to chain yourself to the hob to make a decent risotto. The method below, which involves a mere two minutes of stirring, comes from a fourth-generation rice grower from the Veneto. And if it’s good enough for him …125ml white wine550ml stock3 tbsp butter ½ onion, peeled and chopped200g risotto rice, carnaroli or vialone nano ideally, though arborio will do25g parmesan, gratedBring the wine and 400ml of the stock to a simmer (chicken or vegetable are the most versatile, but ham, fish or beef may work better, depending on your choice of ingredients: if you’re using a stock pot or cube, which can be salty, taste and dilute as necessary before use). Red wine is sometimes used for risottos featuring beef or sausages.Over a medium-low heat, melt two tablespoons of the butter in a wide, shallow pan for which you have a lid (a wide pan means that more of the rice will come into contact with the stock, so it will cook more evenly). If you’re making a seafood risotto, or would simply prefer to keep the dish dairy-free, use extra-virgin olive oil instead.Add the onion to the pan and cook, stirring, until it’s soft and golden make sure it doesn’t brown. Depending on what kind of risotto you’re making, once the onion has begun to soften, you could also chuck in finely chopped garlic, carrot, celery or pancetta, but leave any fresh herbs and other delicate ingredients until the end.Turn up the heat slightly and tip in the rice. Stir to coat with the butter and fry until it’s hot to the touch, without letting it colour. Use arborio rice, if that’s all you can find, but carnaroli and vialone nano are starchier, more robust varieties that are harder to overcook, so will produce a creamier result.Pour in the hot stock and wine, and bring to a simmer. Cover the pan and leave to cook, undisturbed, for 15 minutes – a good time for the cook to pour a glass of wine and put your feet up: once you’ve warmed the remaining stock, cut the rest of the butter into pieces and grated the cheese, that is.After 15 minutes, the rice should be almost tender, with just a hint of bite, and have absorbed all the cooking liquid. Add the butter (or oil) and the remaining 150ml stock to the pan, then stir for a couple of minutes, until the risotto is creamy but the consistency is still fairly loose.Stir in the grated parmesan (or pecorino, or any hard, dry cheese, or leave it out altogether, if you prefer, or if you’re making a seafood risotto). Either way, turn off the heat, cover the pan again and leave to sit for two minutes, then season to taste (a touch of nutmeg works well) and serve.This basic risotto is delicious on its own, or with cooked veg stirred through it (I had mine with wilted spinach and baked squash), but it’s easy to adapt. A classic Milanese risotto, say, is made with beef stock and a good pinch of saffron (add it to the final 150ml stock as it warms) and served alongside osso buco.Mushroom risotto can be made along the same lines, with meat or vegetable stock and the soaking liquid from dried porcini. As can, in just a few weeks’ time, asparagus risotto made with vegetable or chicken stock and a glug of asparagus cooking water. Note that fragile ingredients such as asparagus or seafood are best cooked separately and stirred into the risotto just before serving."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b98bd312c8c104cb5030c3c2a8491b819f74b3d/0_515_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a985ce653f8c803f8c3acdf936bdd34d","title":"brockhampton 14 boyband men colour rap sing gay pop","story":"Most of them are men of colour – and many of their songs address being gay – but that’s not the only way these millennial sensations are reinventing the boybandAmerica’s best new boyband is crammed, 13 deep, into the green room backstage at Chicago’s House of Blues. The sprawling collective known as Brockhampton (minus photographer Ashlan Grey) is preparing for the first of two nights of shows at the 1,800-capacity venue, on the tail end of their almost entirely sold out Love Your Parents tour. Four years ago, its members dropped out of their respective normal lives to move to San Marcos, Texas, where they slept on the floor in unfurnished apartments and spent every waking minute on art. Forget the corporate gloss of traditional boyband fare instead, their songs are a giddy blend of kick-in-the-door raps, sunny-day soul, lighters-in-the-sky pop melodies and skate-punk energy.By typical standards, their work has been paying off – and then some. Last year, the group released not just their debut album, but their second and third, too the third, December’s Saturation III, debuted at No 15 on the US Billboard albums chart. There’s also Billy Star, a feature-length film with original music (the 22-minute trailer is available to stream), along with American Boyband, an eight-episode documentary-style TV series on Viceland. But Kevin Abstract, the group’s de facto leader, isn’t satisfied – not yet.“We were raised differently, and I’m not even necessarily talking about our parents,” he says. The 21-year-old is soft-spoken but intense, radiating passion without raising his voice. “We were obsessed with Kanye West and people who obsess over the shit that they do, it made us the same way. We want to leave a mark, you know? I want people to look back like: Damn, Brockhampton did all of that in a very short amount of time and inspired so many people. I want …” He pauses, trying to consolidate his and his 13 best friends’ ambitions into a cohesive thought. “Fuck! I just want this shit to be so great. I’ve been frustrated lately because I want to be so great.”Reminding him and the crew of an abbreviated list of their recent accomplishments only stokes the embers. “I’m 21 Michael Jackson was 23 when he made Thriller,” Abstract replies, matter-of-fact. When I suggest that a guy who had had to perform since he was six years old might not be the most viable standard for comparison, the room erupts into a vehement chorus of “Why not?!” from all sides.“People want to coddle you and be like: ‘Oh, no, don’t hold yourself to that standard’ – but why?” asks Ameer Vann, the deep-voiced 21-year-old rapper who met Abstract in high school outside Houston, Texas. “Why wouldn’t I want to be Michael? Why wouldn’t I want to be 23 on the cover of Thriller?”“Tupac died when he was 25!” exclaims Romil Hemnani, a 22-year-old originally from Connecticut who is one of the group’s producers. “He was only 25 and he accomplished all that!”“And you know what else we have to remind each other of, even in the bigger sense of things?” adds Henock Sileshi – better known as HK – who is 23 and serves as Brockhampton’s self-taught creative director. “Trayvon Martin died when he was 17. Who is to say Ameer can’t get pulled over and something happens? We still operate in this world.”If Brockhampton make you reassess everything you thought a boyband could be, things are going according to plan. While the crew lead with the music, they double as a self-sufficient creative agency. Alongside the singers, rappers and producers in their 14-man roster are designers, photographers and web developers (such as Robert Ontenient, who joined as a producer but taught himself code from scratch when the group needed a webmaster). There aren’t many, or perhaps any other boybands producing and mixing their own records, shooting and directing their own music videos, designing their own merch and stage sets. And there aren’t many boybands who look like Brockhampton – the majority of its members are men of colour – or whose lyrics reference giving guys head and coming out to their parents. In Junky, Abstract spells it out: “Why you always rap about being gay? ’Cause not enough niggas rap and be gay.”And though cheeky One Direction references are scattered throughout the Saturation trilogy – “I feel just like Zayn, I feel just like Harry,” Vann raps on Boys – Brockhampton don’t sound much like familiar boybands. They rap as often as they sing they idolise Kanye, Wu-Tang Clan, Souls of Mischief and Odd Future, and it shows. In 2018, strict ideas about genre isions are about as relevant as cassette players, and rap’s influence bleeds into just about everything else. In other words, it’s not like hip-hop is not weird enough to accommodate an act such as Brockhampton, if that’s how they wanted to play it. But for Abstract and company, introducing Brockhampton as a boyband in a world that sees men of colour on a stage and automatically thinks “rap crew” was not a decision it was simply what they were. “We’re boys in a band. Right?” asks Vann.“You’ll see publications being like, ‘self-proclaimed boyband’, or put ‘boyband’ in quotes. But why can’t we be that?” Hemnani asks. “The American idea of a boyband is, like, five straight, conventionally attractive white dudes. I come from a south Asian background, and I’m not supposed to be doing any of this. I’m supposed to be a doctor, or work at 7-Eleven, or be an engineer. So, even beyond the boyband thing, doing something out of the norm for my culture in general is big to me.”“The whole point is to redefine it,” Abstract says. “So that a group of kids who look more like us and less like One Direction could be like: ‘I want to be in a boyband. I’m-a do that.’” Specifically, the group likes to use the phrase “all-American boyband” – a phrase that feels especially striking at a time when the surface-level wokeness of US pop culture might lead one to believe that the country is much more socially progressive than it is. Dom McLennon, a 25-year-old rapper who started making beats when he was 11, doesn’t see this framing as optimistic or pessimistic so much as honest. “This is the most all-American shit you could come up with,” he says. “It’s not a positive or negative thing. America’s not a beautiful place. I’m three generations removed from slavery. I don’t have a good history here. But there’s no reason I can’t make one for myself right now.”“NWA was all-American Wu-Tang was all-American,” adds Abstract. “It was just a part of America you may not have seen at the time. And I feel like a Merlyn Wood verse, or an Ameer Vann verse, or Dom – their perspective is just as American as the white kids I went to school with who shot guns and killed animals on the weekends. We’re darker than other boybands and we suck dick, but we’re still very American.” He lets the sentiment sink in for a beat. “You should try to make that the headline.”A few hours later, the crew takes the stage to the swell of the Backstreet Boys’ I Want It That Way the overwhelmingly teenage crowd shouts along to the pop anthem probably released around the time they were born. There are wild screams and chants of “Fuck Pitchfork!” – a trope that’s become a crowd staple at their recent shows, referring to the music website – as Brockhampton explode into Boogie, a euphoric, moshpit-inducing funk banger. On the chorus, Abstract sings: “I’ve been beat up my whole life  I’ve been shot down, kicked out twice  Ain’t no stopping me tonight.” Close your eyes, listen to the crowd’s deafening noise, and you could mistake it for a One Direction reunion show.The next day, the group has planned the tour’s sole meet-and-greet at RSVP Gallery, a streetwear boutique in Wicker Park, Chicago, co-owned by Virgil Abloh of Louis Vuitton. Two hours before it’s scheduled to start, there’s already a queue stretching four blocks. The crowd is almost entirely teens, as erse as Brockhampton’s members themselves Estrella, 20, and Kendall, 19, at the front, have been waiting since 6am – almost nine hours. “There are other bands that have representation, but it’s not like Brockhampton,” says 17-year-old Miracle. “As a black person, seeing other people of colour who are unapologetically themselves, speaking on things like being gay …” “And mental illness, too,” adds her friend Micquela, who is 16. We’re interrupted by Brockhampton members beginning to arrive, and the street goes nuts. “Yo, that’s Ameer!” “Jabari, we love you!” “HK, you look cute today!” The friends laugh as they politely apologise for screaming – it’s just that they have never had musical heroes like this before."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/776cfb6f700fc73280f018797952303683121f99/0_0_3500_2334/master/3500.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=be50454ab52562e749869b0ec80008b5 1320w","title":"amber rudd makes a staggering admission over immigration targets","story":"In 24 hours, the home secretary went from having no idea about the targets to scrapping them“I don’t know what you’re referring to,” said Amber Rudd, the home secretary, as she was questioned about the existence of targets for removing migrants from the UK.Yvette Cooper, the chair of the Commons home affairs select committee, could barely contain her incredulity on Wednesday. Moments earlier, the head of the union for immigration workers had confirmed there were net targets for removing people who were in the country illegally.So did the home secretary mislead the committee? Or is she oblivious to her department’s workings?Come Thursday morning, it appeared to be the latter. “The immigration arm of the Home Office has been using local targets for internal performance management,” she revealed in a staggering admission to the House of Commons in response to an urgent question.At the committee hearing, there was a suggestion Rudd had no grasp of the inner workings of her department.In reference to the existence of targets, she said: “I didn’t hear that testimony, I’m not sure what shape that might be in.”Here is the shape. There are three layers of state-enforced or enforceable departures: deportations, administrative removals and voluntary departures.Deportation is a specific term that applies to people and their children whose removal from the country is deemed “conducive to the public good” by the home secretary. It can also be recommended by a court. Administrative removals, or removals, refer to a larger set of cases involving the enforced removal of non-citizens who have either entered the country illegally, outstayed a visa, or otherwise violated the conditions of their leave to remain in the UK. Finally, there are the voluntary departures. Crucially, these iniduals are still people against whom enforced removal has been initiated. The term “voluntary” simply describes how they leave. Within this category, are three sub-layers: those who depart by assisted voluntary return (AVR) schemes, those who make their own travel arrangements and tell the authorities, and those who leave without notifying the government.It did not take long for evidence of departure targets to emerge. In 2015, David Bolt, an inspector whose job it is to scrutinise the work of the immigration and borders system governed by the Home Office, published a report on enforced removals. Within the publicly available report are a number of references to targets. The key paragraph, 4.16, states:“For 2014-15, the Home Office set a target of 7,200 voluntary departures, an average of 120 per week, with the weekly target rising to 160 by the end of March 2015. For 2015-16, the annual target was raised to 12,000. These targets were split between the 19 ICE teams across the UK.”While technically not a reference to administrative removals, the paragraph is a clear reference to a departure target nonetheless.Crucially, Lucy Moreton, the head of the Union for Borders, Immigration and Customs, said the target culture in immigration operations had trickled down from the headline “net migration target” that Theresa May, the prime minister, has so doggedly kept in place.The target was launched in 2010 by the then prime minister, David Cameron, amid growing fears over the rise of Ukip and against a backdrop of anti-immigration rhetoric. The government has faced repeated calls to ditch the target.It is important to note that the target to reduce net migration – the difference between those leaving and arriving – to less than 100,000 (the most recent estimate puts the figure at 244,000) does not relate entirely to illegal migration. But observers have cited it as the source from which May’s “hostile environment” policies flowed. And that links back to the Windrush scandal. May’s policies have been heavily blamed for the desperate circumstances in which some Commonwealth migrants have found themselves.Later on Thursday, Rudd said that, now she was aware of them, she would scrap Home Office targets for removing people from Britain. It seems likely the government will also face calls, yet again, to scrap its headline net migration target."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd6d898acfd569ecd98de6c65fe6147a68cbd344/0_1639_2769_1661/master/2769.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71a02824ab876fce503824707738ccee","title":"ben ainslie gets americas cup funding from backer of brexit and fracking","story":"Jim Ratcliffe of Ineos to fund challenge for most prestigious event in world sailingBen Ainslie’s latest America’s Cup bid is being bankrolled to the tune of £110m by the billionaire pro-Brexit businessman Jim Ratcliffe, whose petrochemical company Ineos is one of the main fracking firms in the UK.The most successful sailor in history, Ainslie is a four-time Olympic gold medalist. He won the America’s Cup in 2013 with the USA-based team Oracle, but the most prestigious event in world sailing has not been won by a British boat for 168 years.The money will fund a two-boat challenge for the 36th America’s Cup, which will take place in New Zealand in 2021. “The investment of Ineos leaves us with our best ever chance of bringing the America’s Cup home,” Ainslie said. Ratcliffe, who publicly declared his support for Brexit, said he was horrified by how long it had been without a British winner of the America’s Cup.Ratcliffe co-founded Ineos, Britain’s biggest privately owned company, in 1998 and has grown it into one of the world’s top 10 petrochemicals businesses, leasing or buying unwanted assets from firms such as BP and ICI.He is one of the main UK exponents of fracking, a controversial process of drilling down into the earth before a high-pressure water mixture is directed at the rock to release the gas inside.The announcement of the backing was made at the Prospect of Whitby pub in Wapping, south London, where Ainslie said he felt the partnership with Ineos was a good fit despite the company’s support for fracking.“Sustainability remains a big focus of the team,” Ainslie said. “Fracking is not a subject I’m an expert on, but I know having worked with Ineos for this partnership that they take their responsibilities with the environment extremely seriously and they’re a great partner.“One of Ineos’s key areas is plastic and they absolutely share that desire to stop plastic going into the oceans.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bf8b994cd1b04311e62678d39ce9b6f33f196b6/0_3_5102_3061/master/5102.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f429f5f3b3e18d8f621b4c31032f9ac","title":"eoin morgan not dreaming england world cup","story":"Eoin Morgan will not allow himself to visualise lifting the World Cup at Lord’s next summer but believes his England team will definitely be among the contenders if they continue their current improvement.Fixtures for the 2019 tournament were announced on Thursday, with England’s campaign in the all-play-all, 10-team group stage starting against South Africa at the Oval on 30\u0026nbspMay and playing at nine of the 11 host venues overall.Morgan’s side have risen to No\u0026nbsp3 in the ODI rankings after six consecutive series wins and have just enjoyed one of their best winters, with victories in Australia and New Zealand.

DeNada Dance Theatre’s production opens with Beauty (Emma Louise Walker) lying inert on a bordello floor with her legs spread. The beasts of the story are four men who brace their arms like stags locking horns, or face each other off with cockfight struts. Awoken, Beauty struggles but fails to escape, until she encounters an altogether different beast: the fabulous Marivi da Silva as the Bull, flamenco-skirted, her breasts in straps and horns upon her head. This mythic creature comes to represent a different, fantastical alternative: a mix of power, tenderness and passionate sensuality. No wonder Beauty falls for the Bull and no wonder the beasts hound them.For all its emotive imagery and heightened conflict, the first act feels laboured. The setup is schematic, the musical playlist keeps chopping into the action, and too often the choreography fills out the music instead of motivating it.Act two sees both piece and performers shift into gear. The male dancers, now costumed like the Bull in horns, harnesses and skirts, perform as “dragimals” – flamboyant, chimerical creatures who mix Swan Lake arms with showtime shimmies, Mata Hari exoticism with King Kong voodoo. It’s all deliriously inauthentic, and segues into a polymorphously perverse love-in of unbound eroticism. For Beauty, this looks like heaven. But the men return as circus ringmasters, de-horning the Bull, forcing Beauty into a bridal gown and tethering her to net curtains. The music comes to a melodramatic climax and so, pelvises pumping, do the guys.Subtlety be damned! That’s fine – but sometimes the piece feels more driven by Guerra’s ideas than his characters. When those characters do come to life, though, they can set the stage alight. Da Silva – strong, wild, fearless – is dynamite throughout.

Here’s what he and they had to sayMike Schroepfer may not have been Mark Zuckerberg, but Facebook’s chief technology officer was nevertheless forced to admit in front of MPs that the company had made errors in its handling of the Cambridge Analytica data breach, faced questions over what the company had not told MPs in a previous hearing, and apologised for threatening the  with legal action.Here are the five main points from his appearance before the digital, culture, media and sport select committee:1. Facebook missed opportunities to prevent and then deal appropriately with the data breach at the time. Schroepfer acknowledged that nobody at Facebook had read the terms and conditions behind Aleksander Kogan’s data harvesting questionnaire when he proposed it in 2014. The company only found out about the breach in late 2015 after the  first reported that Kogan’s data had been shared with Cambridge Analytica. Schroepfer said that Facebook had demanded that the 87m records collected were deleted, but the breach was not reported to regulators. “It was a mistake not to inform people at the time,” Schroepfer was forced to concede.2. Facebook “lacked integrity” because it failed to tell MPs the extent of the data breach at a previous hearing in February. Ian Lucas, a Labour MP, relentlessly pressed Schroepfer as to why company executives had not admitted what Facebook knew about the data breach when they gave evidence to the committee in February. Schroepfer struggled to explain, saying: “A lot of this has come to light in sharp relief for us in the last month.” Lucas was very critical: “I remain unconvinced the company has integrity.” The MP then asked what Mark Zuckerberg knew at the time and whether he would give evidence. “I will report back,” Schroepfer said.3. It was wrong for Facebook to threaten legal action against the  as an article about the Cambridge Analytica data breach was close to publication. Julian Knight, a Conservative MP and former journalist, demanded that Schroepfer apologise for “this bullying tactic”. The Facebook executive left MPs incredulous as he said “my understanding is that this is common practice in the UK”. When pressed by Knight again, Schroepfer finally apologised: “I am sorry that journalists feel we are attempting to prevent the truth coming out.”4. Facebook said leave campaigners had spent $2m on digital adverts during the referendum campaign. The money was spent by Aggregate IQ, the Canadian data company used by Vote Leave and other pro-Brexit campaigns, although the figure disclosed was noticeably lower than the £3.5m that pro-Brexit campaigns told the Electoral Commission they had spent with the same firm. There was no discussion about why the sums differed. 5. Official inquiries are ongoing. Schroepfer said he had met the information commissioner this week, and that the company had provided information to the Electoral Commission. He was then pressed on why Facebook executives were in Cambridge Analytica’s office at the time the data breach revelations emerged. Knight asked if Facebook was “perverting the course of justice”. Schroepfer said: “As soon as the information commissioner asked us to stand down, we said of course your investigation takes precedence.” The company also unveiled plans to label political ads, and who has paid for them, before May 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14a292a09b2bf9f66c0577e8c5b5e371b7d33d2b/159_0_2785_1673/master/2785.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2862d0b8497dc525a2568b36df5af206","title":"snapchat new spectacles launch","story":"Only 220,000 units of wearable gadget were sold first time around, with the tech firm writing off $40m in the processSnap is doubling down on its hardware business, launching a new version of its Spectacles camera-glasses today with a better camera, the ability to take still images and water resistance.The new model comes as Snapchat attempts to recover from the disappointing long-term fate of the first generation, which gathered attention – and long queues – when they were launched in extremely limited quantities in November 2016, but failed to sell in large numbers when they were eventually released on general sale. Over the lifetime of the product, Snap sold just 220,000 units, the company says, eventually writing off unsold inventory worth almost $40m.This time round, the new Spectacles will be available from Snap’s website, at a price of £149.99, and are launching simultaneously in the UK, US, Canada and France, and more widely across Europe the following week.Snap’s decision to recommit to Spectacles has come as a surprise, as many competitors are shifting away from smart glasses in general. Intel launched its own product, a pair of specs that use lasers to shine information directly into wearers’ eyes, in February this year, but had cancelled the project by April, noting that new technologies “sometimes require tough choices when market dynamics don’t support further investment”. Similarly, the Google Glass smart spectacles, launched in 2013, famously earned its wearers the sobriquet “Glasshole”, and the company eventually stopped producing the device in 2015.Snap says the focus on hardware is a critical part of its future.

My goal is bring real changes to Armenia.”The Republican party has rapidly been losing support, with a nationalist minority party declaring its support for the street protests in recent days.Russia, which has deep military and economic ties with Armenia, has engaged in a flurry of diplomacy to deescalate the standoff between the government and the Pashinyan-led opposition, which had shut down large parts of Yerevan, Armenia’s capital, by holding mass marches through the city.Moscow has two military bases in the ex-Soviet republic, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, spoke to the Armenian president, Armen Sarkissian, by phone on Wednesday.They agreed that political forces must show restraint and solve the crisis through dialogue, the Kremlin said.Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, held talks in Moscow on Thursday with his Armenian counterpart, Eduard Nalbandian, Russia’s foreign ministry said.Armenia’s acting vice-premier, Armen Gevorkyan, also met Russian presidential administration officials to discuss the situation, relations between the two countries and preparations for the upcoming summit of the Russia-led economic union. Pashinyan said on Wednesday he had received assurances from Russian officials that Moscow would not intervene in the crisis, ruling out a scenario similar to Russia’s intervention in eastern Ukraine. Armenia’s foreign minister, Edward Nalbandian, was in Moscow on Thursday for talks.Pashinyan has said the movement “has no geopolitical context”, and that the revolution that booted out the country’s government was neither pro-western, nor pro-Russian."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Dubliner Marie Collins played major role in pope\u0026rsquos admission of error in disbelieving victimsAnti-abortion group launches online petition calling on chairman to step down from role\u0026euro70,000 was stolen during recession when employees at Cork haulage company were taking pay cutsSimon Coveney says spending to combat world hunger \u0026lsquorooted in our own experiences\u0026rsquoScheme now expected to cost Government more than \u0026euro40 million in full yearDelaying tactics are costing lives, RSA chairwoman Liz O\u0026rsquoDonnell claimsMattie McGrath claims \u0026euro10m spent on psychological services but \u0026euro400m on medicationSixteen journalism students from across Ireland awarded at annual awardsEamon Ryan criticises Government for being \u0026lsquoall at sea\u0026rsquo on single-use plastic wasteRegeneration group puts forward \u0026euro56m \u0026lsquocost rental\u0026rsquo scheme for former flats in InchicoreTaoiseach makes case for integration on several issues but reiterates resistance on taxGreece asked Ireland to recover penalty from trucker wrongly convicted of smugglingLack of political will \u0026lsquocondemning Irish nature to loss and decline\u0026rsquo, NGOs warnJudge warns man not to threaten him during fraught proceedings over repossession of houseCompany follows Panda and City Bin in introducing charge, which it expects to be \u0026euro20 a yearJohn O\u0026rsquoDonoghue (62) collapsed and died as he was about to confront the two intrudersCourt hears Ronald McKenzie acted as drug storeman while William Power was \u0026lsquocynical organiser\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3475659.1524765262!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk s red lines only barrier to close ties with eu says varadkar","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar: ‘The threat on our doorstep today is Brexit.’ File photograph: Clodagh KilcoyneReutersIreland’s and the EU’s relationship with the UK needs to continue to be “close, comprehensive and ambitious”, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has told students in Belgium. “I believe the only barrier to achieving this is the United Kingdom’s own red lines. If these change, Europe’s position can evolve too,” he said. Mr Varadkar warned that time was running out, “there is less than a year until the UK leaves” and insisted it was “essential” that solid progress was made on the Border issue by June. “Without a solution to the Irish Border there can be no withdrawal agreement. Let there be no doubt about that,” he said, echoing a message that has repeatedly come out of Brussels in the last fortnight.The Taoiseach, giving the Wilfried Martens Future of Europe lecture in the Catholic university of Leuven, set out Ireland’s stall across the full range of EU policies, his own strong support for integration and the personal inspiration of Mr Martens, a founder of Fine Gael’s European grouping, the European People’s Party. “The threat on our doorstep today is Brexit, ” Mr Varadkar said. He emphasised the Government’s determination to defend the gains of the Northern Irish peace process and the Belfast Agreement “in all its parts, and all that flows from it peace, powersharing and NorthSouth co-operation.” “It is why we have insisted that there can be no hardening of the Border on our island: no new barriers to the movement of people or to trade.”He also made a case for the defence for programmes such as the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) and cohesion funding, and expanding into new areas such as migration and research and extending the Erasmus student programme. “I support calls for the establishment of a common asylum policy and system, to replace the current one which is clearly not working. A small number of countries are shouldering the responsibility of providing refugees with a fresh start in Europe,” he said. Mr Varadkar affirmed Ireland’s commitment to supporting European security and engaging with the new EU defence framework, Pesco and to fulfilling “the promise of the single market – for example, in insurance, mortgages and loans – so that people can get cheaper loans from European lenders and insurers if necessary”. As EU finance ministers gather in Sofia, Bulgaria, for a first round of discussions on new European Commission plans to tax the digital economy, Mr Varadkar insisted “we should not accept a situation where large corporations can avoid paying any taxes anywhere”. But, putting down a clear marker that Ireland’s position on tax is not about to waver, he insisted “decisions on national budgets and the taxation that funds these budgets should be determined by national parliaments and governments”.“Issues such as climate change, cybersecurity, mass migration, international trade, and the regulation of major corporations are transnational, and cannot be solved by 28 countries coming up with 28 different solutions. We need to think and act together,” he said.Warning of the “dangers of populism, nationalism and anti-politics”, Mr Varadkar quoted the Bulgarian writer Ivan Krastev.“In his recent book: After Europe, he observed that: ‘Tolerance and civility were long the defining characteristics of the European Union’ but that ‘today they are often perceived as the EU’s core vulnerabilities.’” Mr Varadkar added: “Those who try to entice Europeans down the pathway of populism and nationalism offer a dark and desperate future, and they know it. “I am utterly and unshakably convinced,” he said, “that the European Union offers something else.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3475764.1524772585!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"former tory ministers back uk staying in eu customs union","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConservative support for remaining in a customs union with the EU after Brexit indicates the strength of a growing rebellion on prime minister Theresa May’s backbenches. Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesA number of former Conservative ministers have voiced support for remaining in a customs union with the European Union after Brexit during a parliamentary debate that showed the strength of a growing rebellion on Theresa May’s backbenches.Conservatives abstained on the non-binding motion in favour of customs union membership but pro-European Tories joined opposition MPs to speak in favour of it.Former attorney general Dominic Grieve accused the government of adopting a blundering approach to Brexit which ignored the reality that new trade deals outside the EU could not compensate for the loss of single-market and customs-union membership.“Why is it that the deputy ambassador of Japan has us all in and says: ‘You do realise that every Japanese company will be gone in 10 years’ time if they cannot have frictionless trade into the European Union?’ We are behaving in the most extraordinary and blinded fashion as we blunder around ignoring the realities. And, in any case, free-trade agreements come with strings attached,” he said.“If you have a free-trade agreement, if you have multiple free-trade agreements, they will very quickly start to look like customs unions. That’s what happens when people get together. So this ‘customs union bad, somehow free-trade agreement good’ simply does not stack up. It is time for a reality check. In fact, we need more than a customs union because, as is also clearly obvious, we are not going to be able to trade without regulatory alignment.”George Freeman, Ms May’s former policy chief, said many of his constituents who voted Leave said they were happy with the single market but objected to a political union. Luke Graham, a Conservative MP who won his seat in Ochil and South Perthshire last year, rejected the accusation that remaining in a customs union was a betrayal of the Brexit vote.“None of our constituents voted to be poorer. None of our constituents wanted to have more barriers between ourselves and our international trading partners. We don’t mind the labels, we don’t mind the mechanism, but I know from my constituents they want to be able to have a customs system that they can rely on, that respects the United Kingdom’s integrity, but also allows them to prosper and be better off than they are today,” he said.Conservative Brexiteer Hugo Swire said remaining in the customs union made no sense at a time when the EU’s share of global trade was shrinking. He said leaving it was a necessary step to restoring Britain’s global trading role.“The government have set out to ensure that we are a truly global Britain. As we have heard, remaining inside a customs union with the EU would prevent the UK from committing to that agenda and striking lucrative free-trade agreements with countries across the world,” he said.Veteran pro-European Conservative Ken Clarke poured scorn on the idea that lucrative new trade deals awaited Britain once it leaves the EU.“The idea that some marvellous new global future with fantastic new trade deals is about to open up is hopeless. If someone can get the Americans to open up their public procurement to international competition and give up the ‘Buy America’ policy or to open the regulatory barriers that they have put in the way of professional and financial services, they will be a miraculous negotiator, because we could get nowhere when Obama was in power. I do not think that the present administration are offering us anything they just want their beef to come here,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

around world miss life saving vaccines","story":"A health worker gives a polio vaccine to a girl in Lahore, PakistanMore than one in 10 children around the world miss out on basic life-saving vaccinations, according to figures released by the World Health Organization.To mark World Immunisation Week, running from April 24 to April 28, WHO is highlighting the importance of vaccines but is also warning that a large number of children do not receive any vaccinations at all.An estimated 19.5m children missed out on the basic diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis – or whooping cough – (DTP) vaccine in 2016, estimates WHO.Despite efforts to boost vaccination rates over the past decade progress has stalled and just 86 per cent of infants worldwide – 116.5m – received the basic DTP vaccine. WHO says that between two and three million lives are saved every year through the DTP vaccine but an additional 1.5million deaths could be avoided if coverage improved. About 60 per cent of the children missing out on these life-saving vaccines live in just 10 countries.WHO recommends that all children should be given the following vaccines: BCG where there are high rates of tuberculosis hepatitis B polio DTP Haemophilus influenzae type b pneumococcal disease rotavirus measles and rubella.It also recommends that adolescent girls are vaccinated against the human papilloma virus to protect them from contracting cervical cancer. And some vaccines, such as yellow fever, are recommended for particular regions. .html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}However, poor vaccine coverage is not just a problem in developing countries. Latest data from WHO shows that in Europe there were 21,000 cases of measles in 2017, compared to 5,000 the previous year.And this was partly due to a decline in the number of people vaccinated as well as a shortage in the supply of vaccines and poor disease surveillance, said WHO.The largest outbreaks of the disease were in Romania, where there were 5,562 cases and Italy, where there were 5,006 cases. In Germany there were 927 cases and the disease and in the UK there were 282. WHO launched the Global Vaccine Action Plan in 2011 with a goal to preventing millions of deaths but some key targets are off track.Vaccines | Global coverage by the end of 2016For example, 40 priority countries should have eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus by 2015 but only 18 countries have met this goal. And by 2016 at least four WHO world regions should have eliminated measles – only one, the WHO region of the Americas, has achieved this. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the WHO, said World Immunisation Week, was an opportunity \u0026quotto remind everyone of the incredible value of vaccines\u0026quot.\u0026quotYes, vaccines work, vaccines prevent disease, vaccines save lives,\u0026quot he said. Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security The tragic case of Alfie Evans, and why his parents won\u0026#39t be allowed to take him home to dieNorth and South Korea meet for historic peace talks as neighbours watch with bated breath What it\u0026#39s like to take ayahuasca: My trip with the tribal hallucinogen linked to a brutal lynching in the AmazonAmerica opens first national memorial to lynching victimsFrench town of Vittel suffering water shortages as Nestle accused of \u0026#39overusing\u0026#39 resourcesBill Cosby found guilty of sexual assault by jury in PhiladelphiaImmigration lawyers using delaying tactics to keep illegal immigrants in Britain, High Court says Duke and Duchess of Cambridge still \u0026#39working on\u0026#39 name for the Royal babyLow pay, unsocial hours and immigration law are causing a crisis in horse racingZoe Ball tried to save her lover before he killed himself, inquest hearsAlfie Evans\u0026#39 father in dramatic u-turn as he asks supporters to \u0026#39return to their lives\u0026#39 in his \u0026#39last\u0026#39 interviewLondon theatre: the 26 best plays and shows on nowSpain ‘wolf pack’ cleared of gang raping teenager during bull festival Comment: Building-one room flats will not resolve the housing crisisTrue Horror\u0026#39s grandfather from hell: the strange story of the Ghost in the WallFirst Mars round-trip announced in hope for discovery of alien lifeSalisbury police say they already have enough to deal with as officers have to chase naked couple through the streetsWidow sues her dead banker husband\u0026#39s lover for return of £2.2million share of Belgravia mansionEgypt to fine its own traders £400 for harassing touristsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/25/TELEMMGLPICT000135643698_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrnKnv-EZ40EhYX8nU7dr81GwsaKsFlgjiGj2x2RvG-c.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"tsb meltdown shows never accept slaves technology","story":"IT failures at British Airways, the NHS and now TSB have shaken our confidence in companies\u0026#39 use of our data  I remember very clearly my father’s initial scepticism about electric car windows.

We hope you will respect this.\u0026quotEarlier on Thursday, Mr Evans appealed to Pope Francis to travel to Liverpool to see the plight of his son who he claims is being held hostage at Alder Hey hospital.Tom Evans, who has been at the centre of a bitter legal dispute with the hospital, told the Catholic channel TV2000 on Thursday: \u0026quotI call on the pope to come here to see what is happening.\u0026quotCome here and see how my son is the hostage of this hospital. What we are enduring is not right.\u0026quotRome\u0027s Vatican-owned pediatric hospital Bambino Gesù has offered to treat the 23-month-old boy, who has a serious undiagnosed brain condition.    The government in Rome has granted Alfie Italian citizenship in a bid to bring him to Italy and beat rulings to let him die.    But the British courts have refused to allow the child, who continues to fight after being taken off life support earlier this week, to be transferred to Italy.    \u0026quotThank you Italy. We love you,\u0026quot Mr Evans said. \u0026quotAlfie is part of the Italian family. He is part of Italy. We belong to Italy\u0026quot.The father is due to meet with doctors at Alder Hey hospital to ask them to let him take his son home.He told reporters outside the hospital that a bid to take his son to Italy for treatment, backed by the Pope, had been rejected.However, he said there is still hope for him to take the 23 month-old home.Mr Evans said: \u0026quotWe got rejected yesterday to go to Italy. We could take it further but would it be the right thing to do?\u0026quotSo what we are doing to do today is we are meeting with the doctors at Alder Hey and we now start asking to go home.\u0026quotTom Evans, father of Alfie Evans, speaks to the media outside Alder Hey Children\u0026#39s Hospital on April 26, 2018 in LiverpoolHe claimed on Good Morning Britain that nurses had been shocked by Alfie\u0027s condition, explaining: \u0026quotFor the third day there\u0027s not been one single problem with him. The nurses come in and say \u0027wow.\u0027\u0026quotOn Wednesday, it emerged that Alfie, who stopped receiving life-support treatment late on Monday as a result of the court’s decision, is now “struggling” and is not expected to live much longer.There have been passionate protests staged outside the hospital in recent days, with some campaigners clashing with police as they tried to force their way into the hospital.On Wednesday evening, Ch Insp Chris Gibson said social media posts were being monitored and “any offences, including malicious communications and threatening behaviour, will be investigated and, where necessary, will be acted upon”.The chairman of the Alder Hey Children’s NHS Foundation Trust, Sir David Henshaw said that staff had “endured attacks upon our motivation, our professionalism and our ethics\u0026quot.“Our staff have received in person, via phone calls, email, and through social media channels a barrage of highly abusive and threatening language and behaviour that has shocked us all. Worse still, patients and visitors to Alder Hey have also reported abuse.”Alfie has been in Alder Hey with a rare undiagnosed degenerative neurological condition since December 2016.Doctors have said the toddler’s brain has been destroyed by his illness and it is in his best interests to withdraw life support.In a statement the hospital said its \u0026quottop priority remains in ensuring Alfie receives the care he deserves to ensure his comfort, dignity and privacy are maintained throughout.\u0026quotThis includes working closely with Kate and Tom as they spend this precious time together with him.\u0026quotThe tragic case of Alfie Evans, and why his parents won\u0026#39t be allowed to take him home to dieNorth and South Korea meet for historic peace talks as neighbours watch with bated breath What it\u0026#39s like to take ayahuasca: My trip with the tribal hallucinogen linked to a brutal lynching in the AmazonAmerica opens first national memorial to lynching victimsFrench town of Vittel suffering water shortages as Nestle accused of \u0026#39overusing\u0026#39 resourcesBill Cosby found guilty of sexual assault by jury in PhiladelphiaImmigration lawyers using delaying tactics to keep illegal immigrants in Britain, High Court says Duke and Duchess of Cambridge still \u0026#39working on\u0026#39 name for the Royal babyLow pay, unsocial hours and immigration law are causing a crisis in horse racingZoe Ball tried to save her lover before he killed himself, inquest hearsLondon theatre: the 26 best plays and shows on nowSpain ‘wolf pack’ cleared of gang raping teenager during bull festival Comment: Building-one room flats will not resolve the housing crisisTrue Horror\u0026#39s grandfather from hell: the strange story of the Ghost in the WallFirst Mars round-trip announced in hope for discovery of alien lifeSalisbury police say they already have enough to deal with as officers have to chase naked couple through the streetsWidow sues her dead banker husband\u0026#39s lover for return of £2.2million share of Belgravia mansionEgypt to fine its own traders £400 for harassing touristsWhy did Harold Shipman kill more than 250 of his patients?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"could north korea summit really convince kim jong un give nuclear","story":"Friday’s historic inter-Korean summit is already oozing with overloaded symbolism, from subtle touches in the meeting room décor to the meticulously planned menu designed to evoke memories of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s more carefree childhood in Switzerland.A painting portraying the soft blue and purple hues of North Korea’s Mount Kumgang will loom over the second floor meeting room in the Peace House on the demilitarised borderzone between North and South where the nations’ two leaders will sit on chairs etched with carvings of their shared peninsula.Kim Jong-un will step south of the border at 9.30am (2.30am BST), the first North Korean leader ever to do so.In tow will be his younger...To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeTo continue reading this article log in to your  account.

She said that her child had been disturbed by the publication of the photograph, which she considered to be private.The newspaper did not accept a breach of the Code. The photograph had been taken ten years ago, so it did not consider that the child, who was not named in the article, would be easily recognisable from the image. It also noted that the image was publicly available on the complainant’s public Facebook page. The newspaper said that in any case, there was also a public interest in publishing the photograph as it helped to bring home to readers the gravity of the situation in which children had been involved.The article clearly reported on a subject which involved the child’s welfare: she had been involved in a shooting and had witnessed her mother being shot and seriously injured. The un-pixilated photograph of the child showed her full face. The image of the child had been taken 10 years ago however, this did not justify the newspaper’s decision to publish it un-pixilated in the context of this article as the child was still under 16 at the time of publication.Publishing the unedited image in the context of this story, without the consent of a parent or a similarly responsible adult, represented a breach of Clause 6. There was no specific public interest in publishing this image, particularly as an exceptional public interest justification was required in the case of a child.

Rohan Deb Roy says we must rethink research and practice to escape this dark pastSir Ronald Ross had just returned from an expedition to Sierra Leone. The British doctor had been leading efforts to tackle the malaria that so often killed English colonists in the country, and in December 1899 he gave a lecture to the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce about his experience. In the words of a contemporary report, he argued that “in the coming century, the success of imperialism will depend largely upon success with the microscope”.Teenage vandals sentenced by judge to read history booksRoss, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his malaria research, would later deny he was talking specifically about his own work. But his point neatly summarised how the efforts of British scientists was intertwined with their country’s attempt to conquer a quarter of the world.Ross was very much a child of empire, born in India and later working there as a surgeon in the imperial army. So when he used a microscope to identify how a dreaded tropical disease was transmitted, he would have realised that his discovery promised to safeguard the health of British troops and officials in the tropics. In turn, this would enable Britain to expand and consolidate its colonial rule.Ronald Ross at his lab in 1898 Calcutta (Welcome Collection)Ross’s words also suggest how science was used to argue imperialism was morally justified because it reflected British goodwill towards colonised people. It implied that scientific insights could be redeployed to promote superior health, hygiene and sanitation among colonial subjects. Empire was seen as a benevolent, selfless project. As Ross’s fellow Nobel laureate Rudyard Kipling described it, it was the “white man’s burden” to introduce modernity and civilised governance in the colonies.But science at this time was more than just a practical or ideological tool when it came to empire. Since its birth around the same time as Europeans began conquering other parts of the world, modern Western science was inextricably entangled with colonialism, especially British imperialism. And the legacy of that colonialism still pervades science today.As a result, recent years have seen an increasing number of calls to “decolonise science”, even going so far as to advocate scrapping the practice and findings of modern science altogether. Tackling the lingering influence of colonialism in science is much needed. But there are also dangers that the more extreme attempts to do so could play into the hands of religious fundamentalists and ultra-nationalists. We must find a way to remove the inequalities promoted by modern science while making sure its huge potential benefits work for everyone, instead of letting it become a tool for oppression.When a slave in an early 18th-century Jamaican plantation was found with a supposedly poisonous plant, his European overlords showed him no mercy. Suspected of conspiring to cause disorder on the plantation, he was treated with typical harshness and hanged to death. The historical records don’t even mention his name. His execution might also have been forgotten forever if it weren\u0027t for the scientific enquiry that followed. Europeans on the plantation became curious about the plant and, building on the slave’s “accidental finding”, they eventually concluded it wasn’t poisonous at all.Instead it became known as a cure for worms, warts, ringworm, freckles and cold swellings, with the name Apocynum erectum. As the historian Pratik Chakrabarti argues in a recent book, this incident serves as a neat example of how, under European political and commercial domination, gathering knowledge about nature could take place simultaneously with exploitation.For imperialists and their modern apologists, science and medicine were among the gracious gifts from the European empires to the colonial world. What’s more, the 19th-century imperial ideologues saw the scientific successes of the West as a way to allege that non-Europeans were intellectually inferior and so deserved and needed to be colonised.A racist caricature of European scientists visiting Africa. The severed head on the right is that of Ronald Ross (Welcome Collection)In the incredibly influential 1835 memo Minute on Indian Education, British politician Thomas Macaulay denounced Indian languages partially because they lacked scientific words. He suggested that languages such as Sanskrit and Arabic were “barren of useful knowledge”, “fruitful of monstrous superstitions” and contained “false history, false astronomy, false medicine”.Such opinions weren’t confined to colonial officials and imperial ideologues and were often shared by various representatives of the scientific profession. The prominent Victorian scientist Sir Francis Galton argued that the “the average intellectual standard of the negro race is some two grades below our own (the Anglo Saxon)”. Even Charles Darwin implied that “savage races” such as “the negro or the Australian” were closer to gorillas than were white Caucasians.Yet 19th-century British science was itself built upon a global repertoire of wisdom, information, and living and material specimens collected from various corners of the colonial world. Extracting raw materials from colonial mines and plantations went hand in hand with extracting scientific information and specimens from colonised people.Leading public scientific institutions in imperial Britain, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the British Museum, as well as ethnographic displays of “exotic” humans, relied on a global network of colonial collectors and go-betweens. By 1857, the East India Company’s London zoological museum boasted insect specimens from across the colonial world, including from Ceylon, India, Java and Nepal.The scientists who used this evidence were rarely sedentary geniuses working in laboratories insulated from imperial politics and economics. The likes of Charles Darwin on the Beagle and botanist Sir Joseph Banks on the Endeavour literally rode on the voyages of British exploration and conquest that enabled imperialism.Sir Hans Sloane’s imperial collection started the British Museum (Paul HudsonWikipedia)Other scientific careers were directly driven by imperial achievements and needs. Early anthropological work in British India, such as Sir Herbert Hope Risley’s Tribes and Castes of Bengal, published in 1891, drew upon massive administrative classifications of the colonised population.Map-making operations including the work of the Great Trigonometrical Survey in South Asia came from the need to cross colonial landscapes for trade and military campaigns. The geological surveys commissioned around the world by Sir Roderick Murchison were linked with intelligence gathering on minerals and local politics.Efforts to curb epidemic diseases such as plague, smallpox and cholera led to attempts to discipline the routines, diets and movements of colonial subjects. This opened up a political process that the historian David Arnold has termed the “colonisation of the body”. By controlling people as well as countries, the authorities turned medicine into a weapon with which to secure imperial rule.New technologies were also put to use expanding and consolidating the empire. Photographs were used for creating physical and racial stereotypes of different groups of colonised people. Steamboats were crucial in the colonial exploration of Africa in the mid-19th century. Aircraft enabled the British to surveil and then bomb rebellions in 20th-century Iraq. The innovation of wireless radio in the 1890s was shaped by Britain’s need for discreet, long-distance communication during the South African war.In these ways and more, Europe’s leaps in science and technology during this period both drove and were driven by its political and economic domination of the rest of the world. Modern science was effectively built on a system that exploited millions of people. At the same time it helped justify and sustain that exploitation, in ways that hugely influenced how Europeans saw other races and countries. What’s more, colonial legacies continue to shape trends in science today.Imperialist Cecil Rhodes planned a railway and telegraph line to connect Africa (Alamy)Since the formal end of colonialism, we have become better at recognising how scientific expertise has come from many different countries and ethnicities. Yet former imperial nations still appear almost self-evidently superior to most of the once-colonised countries when it comes to scientific study. The empires may have virtually disappeared, but the cultural biases and disadvantages they imposed have not.How to fix all of your sleep problems with scienceYou just have to look at the statistics on the way research is carried out globally to see how the scientific hierarchy created by colonialism continues. The annual rankings of universities are published mostly by the Western world and tend to favour its own institutions. Academic journals across the different branches of science are mostly dominated by the US and Western Europe.It is unlikely that anyone who wishes to be taken seriously today would explain this data in terms of innate intellectual superiority determined by race. The blatant scientific racism of the 19th century has now given way to the notion that excellence in science and technology are a euphemism for significant funding, infrastructure and economic development.Because of this, most of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean is seen either as playing catch-up with the developed world or as dependent on its scientific expertise and financial aid. Some academics have identified these trends as evidence of the persisting “intellectual domination of the West” and labelled them a form of “neo-colonialism”.Not all international collaborations are equal (US Army AfricaFlickr)Various well-meaning efforts to bridge this gap have struggled to go beyond the legacies of colonialism. For example, scientific collaboration between countries can be a fruitful way of sharing skills and knowledge, and learning from the intellectual insights of one another. But when an economically weaker part of the world collaborates almost exclusively with very strong scientific partners, it can take the form of dependence, if not subordination.A 2009 study showed that about 80 per cent of Central Africa’s research papers were produced with collaborators based outside the region. With the exception of Rwanda, each of the African countries principally collaborated with its former coloniser. As a result, these dominant collaborators shaped scientific work in the region. They prioritised research on immediate local health-related issues, particularly infectious and tropical diseases, rather than encouraging local scientists to also pursue the fuller range of topics pursued in the West.In the same study, 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the scientists based in developed countries did not acknowledge their collaborators in poorer countries as co-authors in their papers. This is despite the fact they later claimed in the survey that the papers were the result of close collaborations.International health charities, which are dominated by Western countries, have faced similar issues. After the formal end of colonial rule, global health workers long appeared to represent a superior scientific culture in an alien environment. Unsurprisingly, interactions between these skilled and dedicated foreign personnel and the local population have often been characterised by mistrust.For example, during the smallpox eradication campaigns of the 1970s and the polio campaign of past two decades, the World Health Organization’s representatives found it quite challenging to mobilise willing participants and volunteers in the interiors of South Asia. On occasions they even saw resistance on religious grounds from local people. But their stringent responses, which included the close surveillance of villages, cash incentives for identifying concealed cases and house-to-house searches, added to this climate of mutual suspicion. These experiences of mistrust are reminiscent of those created by strict colonial policies of plague control.Polio eradication needs willing volunteers (Department for International DevelopmentFlickr)Western pharmaceutical firms also play a role by carrying out questionable clinical trials in the developing world where, as journalist Sonia Shah puts it, “ethical oversight is minimal and desperate patients abound”. This raises moral questions about whether multinational corporations misuse the economic weaknesses of once-colonised countries in the interests of scientific and medical research.The colonial image of science as a domain of the white man even continues to shape contemporary scientific practice in developed countries. People from ethnic minorities are underrepresented in science and engineering jobs and more likely to face discrimination and other barriers to career progress.To finally leave behind the baggage of colonialism, scientific collaborations need to become more symmetrical and founded on greater degrees of mutual respect. We need to decolonise science by recognising the true achievements and potential of scientists from outside the Western world. Yet while this structural change is necessary, the path to decolonisation has dangers of its own.In October 2016, a YouTube video of students discussing the decolonisation of science went surprisingly viral. The clip, which has been watched more than 1m times, shows a student from the University of Cape Town arguing that science as a whole should be scrapped and started again in a way that accommodates non-Western perspectives and experiences. The student’s point that science cannot explain so-called black magic earned the argument much derision and mockery. But you only have to look at the racist and ignorant comments left beneath the video to see why the topic is so in need of discussion.Inspired by the recent “Rhodes Must Fall” campaign against the university legacy of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes, the Cape Town students became associated with the phrase “science must fall”. While it may be interestingly provocative, this slogan isn’t helpful at a time when government policies in a range of countries including the US, UK and India are already threatening to impose major limits on science research funding.More alarmingly, the phrase also runs the risk of being used by religious fundamentalists and cynical politicians in their arguments against established scientific theories such as climate change. This is a time when the integrity of experts is under fire and science is the target of political manoeuvring. So polemically rejecting the subject altogether only plays into the hands of those who have no interest in decolonisation.Alongside its imperial history, science has also inspired many people in the former colonial world to demonstrate remarkable courage, critical thinking and dissent in the face of established beliefs and conservative traditions. These include the Indian anti-caste activist Rohith Vemula and the murdered atheist authors Narendra Dabholkar and Avijit Roy. Demanding that “science must fall” fails to do justice to this legacy.The call to decolonise science, as in the case of other disciplines such as literature, can encourage us to rethink the dominant image that scientific knowledge is the work of white men. But this much-needed critique of the scientific canon carries the other danger of inspiring alternative national narratives in post-colonial countries.A campaigner during a March for Science protest in Melbourne (Wikipedia Commons )For example, some Indian nationalists, including the country’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi, have emphasised the scientific glories of an ancient Hindu civilisation. They argue that plastic surgery, genetic science, aeroplanes and stem cell technology were in vogue in India thousands of years ago. These claims are not just a problem because they are factually inaccurate. Misusing science to stoke a sense of nationalist pride can easily feed into jingoism.Meanwhile, various forms of modern science and their potential benefits have been rejected as unpatriotic. In 2016, a senior Indian government official even went so far as to claim that “doctors prescribing non-Ayurvedic medicines are anti-national”.Attempts to decolonise science need to contest jingoistic claims of cultural superiority, whether they come from European imperial ideologues or the current representatives of post-colonial governments. This is where new trends in the history of science can be helpful.For example, instead of the parochial understanding of science as the work of lone geniuses, we could insist on a more cosmopolitan model. This would recognise how different networks of people have often worked together in scientific projects and the cultural exchanges that helped them – even if those exchanges were unequal and exploitative.But if scientists and historians are serious about “decolonising science” in this way, they need to do much more to present the culturally erse and global origins of science to a wider, non-specialist audience. For example, we need to make sure this decolonised story of the development of science makes its way into schools.Students should also be taught how empires affected the development of science and how scientific knowledge was reinforced, used and sometimes resisted by colonised people. We should encourage budding scientists to question whether science has done enough to dispel modern prejudices based on concepts of race, gender, class and nationality.Schools need to teach the non-Western history of science (Wikipedia Commons)Decolonising science will also involve encouraging Western institutions that hold imperial scientific collections to reflect more on the violent political contexts of war and colonisation in which these items were acquired. An obvious step forward would be to discuss repatriating scientific specimens to former colonies, as botanists working on plants originally from Angola but held primarily in Europe have done. If repatriation isn’t possible, then co-ownership or priority access for academics from post-colonial countries should at least be considered.This is also an opportunity for the broader scientific community to critically reflect on its own profession. Doing so will inspire scientists to think more about the political contexts that have kept their work going and about how changing them could benefit the scientific profession around the world. It should spark conversations between the sciences and other disciplines about their shared colonial past and how to address the issues it creates.Rohan Deb Roy is a lecturer in South Asian history at the University of Reading. theconversationor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Others were able to log in but, when they did, some or all of their account details had disappeared.Customers have also reported that they could access other people’s accounts, including account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories.TSB apology after customers complain of online banking ‘data breach’​TSB could not say how many people were still locked out of the service or when the problems would be fully resolved.The ongoing IT disaster began with botched upgrade work on Friday, but has developed into one of the worst technology failures to hit a UK retail bank and has left many of TSB’s 1.9 million customers furious.Some said they were falling behind with bill payments.Others said they were worried their money had simply disappeared.Many customers expressed frustration that the bank was not being clear about what had happened.That came after Paul Pester, CEO of TSB, tweeted on Wednesday morning: “Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.”Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.MPs demanded answers from TSB on Tuesday. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said: “The reports of unauthorised transactions, access to other customers’ accounts and failures of in-branch services have all the hallmarks of an IT meltdown.“This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems. Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system.

These were not published targets against which performance was assessed, but if they are used inappropriately, then I am clear that this will have to change.”She went on: “I have asked officials to provide me with a full picture of performance measurement tools which are used at all levels and will update the house and the Home Affairs Select Committee as soon as possible.”Amber Rudd denies Home Office have set deportation targetsMs Rudd again repeated that she had not been aware of the targets being used by some officers, but then added: “I want to be aware of them.”Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, highlighted the resignation of former foreign secretary Lord Carrington, who quit after the Falklands were invaded saying it was “a matter of honour”.We now understand that people have been removed because of targets, and she said she didn’t know. I say with all conscience, is she really the right person to lead this office of state?She went on: “Isn’t it time that the home secretary considered her honour and resigned?”Other Labour MPs also attacked Ms Rudd, including David Lammy who has been at the forefront of campaigning for those affected by the Windrush scandal.The Tottenham MP said: “I asked the minister at the last urgent question how many people had been deported, she said she didn’t know. I asked her how many people had been imprisoned in our own country, she said she didn’t know.Amber Rudd says she ‘bitterly, deeply regrets’ failing to see the Windrush scandal sooner“There are impact statements that have been ignored. There are letters from MPs and she said she wasn’t aware of a pattern.“We now understand that people have been removed because of targets, and she said she didn’t know. I say with all conscience, is she really the right person to lead this office of state?”Ms Rudd said that there was an “element of surprise” in the systemic nature of the problem around the Windrush victims, but argued that she had worked to address the issues raised by Mr Lammy after they were brought to her attention.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKWindrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

But the decision set off a nightmare that saw him lose his job, detained twice and almost deported to Jamaica. Jamaica-born Anthony Bryan poses outside his home in Edmonton, north London. Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own. Three Jamaican immigrants (left to right) John Hazel, a 21-year-old boxer, Harold Wilmot, 32, and John Richards, a 22-year-old carpenter, arriving at Tilbury on board the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027, smartly dressed in zoot suits and trilby hats.Newly arrived Jamaican immigrants on board the \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 at Tilbury in 1948.Addressing the Home Affairs Select Committee on Wednesday, she said she had asked for more removals of illegal immigrants to take place, but was not familiar with a suggestion from a union official that regional targets were in place.She said: “We don’t have targets for removals ... If you are asking me if there are numbers of people we expect to be removed that’s not how we operate.”The Conservatives have lost the British Caribbean vote for goodRudd ‘bitterly’ regrets failing to grasp scale of Windrush ‘sooner’Windrush grandmother sacked over status after working decades in UK Amber Rudd’s latest Windrush mea culpa was the least acceptable yetWindrush has brought the African and Caribbean communities togetherEarlier Lucy Moreton, general secretary of the Immigration Service Union, had told the same MPs a national target, broken down regionally, had been set to remove people in the UK illegally, and staff were under “increasing pressure”.She said the government’s net migration target had been “translated down through the operational arm of the Home Office to ... a net removals target that enforcement teams have to meet, so they are aiming to remove a certain number of iniduals in any given month”.Ms Rudd has rejected suggestions that the Conservatives’ goal of reducing net migration below 100,000 had contributed to the Windrush problem.The government has set up a taskforce to help those affected by the Windrush scandal formalise their status, with 3,800 calls made to the helpline, of which 1,364 were potentially Windrush cases.Amber Rudd: Government will waive citizenship fees and tests for those affected by the Windrush scandalCritics say the implementation of the “hostile environment” policy, set out in immigration laws passed while Ms May was at the Home Office, has meant children who came to the UK from the Caribbean as part of the Windrush generation of immigrants from the late 1940s to the 1970s have faced being targeted by immigration officers for deportation.The policy has seen people needing to prove their citizenship with documentary evidence before being able to work, rent homes or receive medical treatment, even if they have been in the country for many years.Often children who travelled to the UK on parents’ passports during the Windrush period did not apply for travel documents, and so lack a trail of official paperwork.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But this will not work. The UK has decided to withdraw from the Union. It wants to be sovereign and be able to set its own rulebook, to have its own supervision and enforcement system.“In doing so, the UK will move away from EU rules. It will not accept common EU supervision and enforcement tools. These are precisely the essential building blocks of our post-crisis financial regulation. They ensure that the internal market can exist and function correctly.‘Everything must change so that everything can stay the same’, to paraphrase Lampedusa. But this will not work.“The EU understands that the UK does not want to become a \u0027rule-taker\u0027. But the UK also needs to understand that the EU cannot accept mutual market access without the common safeguards that underpin it.”Mr Barnier added that relying on Britain to regulate services sold into EU markets was “not something that any country in the world would accept”. He described Brexit as “a lose-lose situation”, telling his audience: “I do not see added value in Brexit and so far, nobody has shown us any.”“Outside of the customs union and the single market, there can be no frictionless trade. Businesses will be faced with non-tariff barriers and border checks that do not exist today,” the chief negotiator warned.Allowing British firms to sell services into the EU is crucial for the UK because around 80 per cent of the British economy comes from providing services, with about 43 per cent of British exports heading to the EU in 2016. The Government has said it want any trade deal with the EU to cover services.Speaking at the same event Mr Barnier said the cost of Brexit “will be substantially higher for the UK than for the EU”, noting that in terms of “trade dependency” the EU27 accounts for around 50 per cent of UK export and imports, while the UK market accounts for 7 per cent of EU exports and 4 per cent of imports. Theresa May has asked for the EU and UK to mutually recognise each others\u0027 rules and regulations as adequate (AP)The Brussels Brexit chief also brushed away claims by British commentators that European businesses desperately needs the City of London for finance. He cited research by the European Central Bank that any problem caused by losing access to London\u0027s banks appears limited and said the claim was not what we hear from market participants, and is not the analysis that we have made ourselves.In her Mansion House speech last month Ms May called for a “comprehensive system of mutual recognition” where both blocs pledged to keep their regulations equivalent to one another to facilitate trade. She said that under such a system “UK law may not necessarily be identical to EU law, but it should achieve the same outcomes”.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.
