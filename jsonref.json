[{"url":null,"title":"Heatwave 2018 UKs hottest summer record","story":"    Wimbledon fans queue for tickets for day two of the tournament. This year’s Wimbledon Championships could have one of the hottest days everChief Meteorologist, Will Lang, said: ‘The heatwave conditions will continue to affect pretty much all parts of the UK over the next few days.‘Although peak temperatures may not be quite as high as we have seen this week, we will still see temperatures widely in the mid to high 20’s  with 30C or more still possible across southern and some central parts of England.’However, that is still a few degrees short of the hottest temperature recorded in the UK.That honour goes to Faversham in Kent in 2003. On August 10, the hottest ever temperature in the UK was recorded there, hitting a mighty 38.5C.The summer of 2003 was an incredibly hot one, with Scotland’s Greycook recording 32.9C one day earlier. It was the hottest temperature ever recorded in Scotland until June 28, 2018.That summer wasn’t the hottest overall, however. That title goes to the summer of 1976, where for 15 days towards the end of June, temperatures in all four nations topped 32C and Cheltenham recorded 35.9C at the start of July.In Dorset and Devon, no measurable rain fell for a staggering 45 days, which led to the passing of the Drought Act and water rationing.It is thought that temperatures will climb over the next two weeks, hitting 33C in the first week of July before potentially topping 35C next week.Dr Thomas Waite of PHE of Public Health England said: ‘It’s vitally important that we keep an eye on friends, family and neighbours who may be at risk.‘For others, the best thing to do is avoid the sun during the hottest parts of the day, carry water with you when travelling and if going out to large events, and we know lots of people will be watching football this week: think what you can do stay cool.’See here for more information on how hot the weather has to be for school and work to get cancelled. World Cup 2018: Bank of Russia jokes it predicted Russia\u0026#8217s victory over Spain on special currencyCalum Best calls for Love Island bosses to have more focus on mental health supportEngland vs Sweden football history revealed ahead of 2018 World Cup fixture on SaturdayPrince Louis christening: Who will Kate Middleton and Prince William invite?EuroMillions results: National lottery winning numbers for Tuesday, 3rd July 2018 drawWhen Kate Middleton will next wear a tiara revealedIndependence Day: How to keep your dog calm during July 4th fireworksBachelorette\u0027s Chris Randone shares photo of himself at age 13 when he was 230lbs... after another contestant said he used to be a \u0027fat f***\u0027Who is Kyle Edmund?

The UK has limited supplies of tap water, and households that pour hundreds of gallons onto their garden are exacerbating a growing shortage and bringing a hosepipe ban ever nearer.Secondly, it’s a waste of effort better used elsewhere. Grass is a hardy plant which, in our climate, is almost impossible to kill. A lawn that looks parched today will quickly recover during a spell of wet weather.‘Never, ever water your lawn — it’s a complete waste of time, energy, money and everything,’ is the stern verdict of Stefan Buczacki, former Gardeners’ Question Time panellist. ‘As I look out of my study, the lawn has gone from green to cornfield brown. But I know it will return, and in the meantime I don’t need to bother mowing every week.’Getting your priorities rightIn nature, the weakest are always the most vulnerable. That means juvenile and new plants, which have yet to properly establish themselves, need the most looking after.In current conditions, anything you’ve planted in the past couple of years ought to be given extra help.Beyond that your priority should be the vegetables which are most vulnerable to drought.‘Courgettes, lettuces, tomatoes, cucumbers — the soft succulent vegetables where the bulk of the crop is made up of water — are obviously the ones that need it the most,’ says Buczacki.Vegetables such as cauliflowers ought to be left until the edible parts of the plant appear, and then watered liberally. The same goes for peas, beans and sweetcorn. Water them before their flowers appear and you’ll have huge plants with plenty of leaves, but not a lot of what you want to eat.Starve it of water and it’ll worry it’s about to die, so set about the business of reproducing — giving you a bigger crop in the process.Want to sunbathe naked during the heatwave? Make sure to...Britain screams for WATER! UK battles double crisis as taps...Share this articleThe best time to water is... 4 amTurning on the hose when the sun’s beating down is pointless: on a warm windy day, 18 per cent of water can evaporate before it even hits the ground. In extreme conditions, water drops can even act as a sort of magnifying glass, scorching healthy leaves.Logic dictates that gardeners should do the job at dusk, giving water plenty of time to work its way into the soil.But there’s a catch. ‘Typically, people get in from work, have a cup of tea and then turn on the hosepipe,’ says Guy Barter, chief horticulturalist at the Royal Horticultural Society.‘This means there’s a huge surge in demand at about 7pm, so the pressure in the system goes right down, and the job takes longer than it should. A better bet, if you can, is to do your watering when everyone else is in bed.’Barter says 4am is actually the best time for the job: there is very little drying wind at that hour, and lots of pressure in the system.You don’t have to be an insomniac to take advantage of these conditions, either: most garden centres sell timers that can be fitted to taps allowing them to do the job while you are asleep.Technique is everythingWatering little and often might sound like a good idea, but it’s a big mistake. By constantly adding moisture to the upper layer of the soil, you are encouraging plants to develop a shallow root system.For a plant to thrive, its roots need to grow as deep as possible.The correct technique, therefore, is to give each plant a thorough soaking every week or two. ‘Rather than giving the whole garden a light spray, you should concentrate your efforts on a few different plants each night,’ advises Barter.‘And to properly refresh the soil, you need much more water than you think — around four two-gallon watering cans full, for each square metre of ground.’And to ensure sufficient liquid actually ends up reaching your plants’ deep roots, he advises building a small bank of soil around the base of each plant before watering, thereby creating a small pool.    Follow our expert tips for the greenest grass and the prettiest plantsWhich beds need most water?This question ides the crowd. Buczacki takes a pragmatic approach, advising gardeners to water only the flowerbeds they see the most of.‘It’s for aesthetic value,’ he says. ‘So if you have a bed that’s 100 yards from the house, you have to ask yourself whether it’s worth the effort. But if it’s right next to you, and you get pleasure from it, then of course things are different.’Sometimes, as with vegetables, starving plants of water can actually make them flower better, adds Barter of the RHS. He recommends that plants in herbaceous borders get a good soaking every fortnight.‘Things like delphiniums and lupins are surprisingly resilient, even in real heatwaves.‘Then, after they have flowered, you can cut them back to ground level and, hopefully, they will re-flower in September.’Other experts are opposed to watering on principle. The late horticulturalist Beth Chatto, who died in May and laid out drought-resistant gardens for the Prince of Wales, took the view that all gardens ought to be able to survive local conditions, so designed flowerbeds to need no watering once they were established.Can you stop soil drying out?A layer of mulch, particularly made from tree bark, can prevent water evaporating from the soil. But beware, there’s no point laying it down now (unless you’ve first soaked the ground thoroughly for hours) since that will simply lock existing dryness in.If you do fancy mulching, add a small amount to the area immediately around each plant, straight after you have just given it a serious drenching.Best flowers for a heatwaveLook for plants that come from hot countries. Geraniums, for instance, are from South Africa, hate their roots getting too wet and are comparatively drought resistant. Ditto African marigolds.Herbs such as rosemary and thyme do especially well in the heat. So, too, does lavender.Plants in pots - a special caseAn exception to the ban on ‘little and often’ watering are plants in pots, which have comparatively small amounts of soil to survive on, so should be watered every day.If that job gets to be too much, the RHS advises transferring plants to bigger pots, which can retain more moisture, or moving them all into a shaded area.Pot plants standing in a single group are easier to water.

The plans demonstrate the bright future in store as we build the UK fishing industry for future generations.\u0027Mr Gove, whose father ran a fish-processing business in Aberdeen, said Brexit would create \u0027a sea of opportunity\u0027 for Britain\u0027s fishing industry. The White Paper, which sets out the Government\u0027s proposals for legislation, paves the way for the biggest shake-up of the industry for more than 40 years.Under existing rules, annual fishing quotas are set by Brussels. EU member states currently land about eight times as much fish from UK waters as the British fleet does in wider EU waters.The proposals will look at new methods for allocating fishing quotas, including scientific analysis of the distribution of fish stocks. And access for EU trawlers will be negotiated on an annual basis rather than fixed permanently by the Brexit deal.Mr Gove also wants to end the hated \u0027discard\u0027 rule which forces fishermen to throw back tons of dead fish every year.Barrie Deas, head of the National Federation of Fishermen\u0027s Organisations, described the plan as \u0027clear and cogent\u0027, adding: \u0027I am sure that it will attract support across the industry and Parliament.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/05/4DE73B7E00000578-5916265-image-a-39_1530678323747.jpg","title":"Fourth July holiday comes no relief sweltering heat country","story":"    Children cool off on a hot summer day at a water park in Alhambra, California on July 3          For the Fourth of July holiday, officials are warning people celebrating outside to remain in the shade and drink plenty of fluids          Gavin Miller, 2, of Tuscarora, Pennsylvania, walks through the water fountain at the Minersville Community PoolAn excessive heat warning is in effect through Tuesday night, with heat index values - which combine temperature and humidity - in New York City reaching 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41°C).A seven-day heat wave, which the NWS said occurs approximately once every 33 years, began in New York on Saturday. Parts of New England experienced record-setting temperatures over the weekend, said Dan Petersen, an NWS meteorologist.At least one heat-related death has been reported since the heat wave began late last week - a Pennsylvania woman who died while working in her garden on Saturday. Another death, of an elderly man in Kansas City, was being investigated.For the Fourth of July holiday, Petersen warned people celebrating outside to remain in the shade and drink plenty of fluids.          An excessive heat warning is in effect through Tuesday night, with heat index values - which combine temperature and humidity - in New York City reaching 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41°C)          A seven-day heat wave, which the NWS said occurs approximately once every 33 years, began in New York on Saturday          Virtually the entire country will experience high temperatures starting in at least the mid-80s on Independence Day          Phoenix, Las Vegas, and El Paso will easily surpass the triple digit mark on Wednesday          On Thursday, the heat will progressively move westward - with Phoenix seeing temperatures surpass 110 degrees          Along the eastern seaboard, rain is expected to provide a bit of a respite from the scorching hot temperatures\u0027Anyone outside in locations with expanded areas of heat is going to have to take precautions,\u0027 Petersen said.\u0027This is the peak of summer – the hottest time of the year.\u0027The NWS also issued an air quality alert on Tuesday, warning of excessive pollution levels in the New York area into the evening hours.Two men plead no contest and will be sentenced to prison...\u0027I come from a third world country and it is not as bad as...Share this articleBut later this week, a storm front is expected to roll through and cool down the eastern seaboard for the weekend, Petersen said, providing relief to Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia on Friday night before heading down to the Carolinas.In a reversal of normal patterns, Petersen said, the hot weather will head west, hitting the central United States late in the week before reaching Los Angeles and San Diego on Friday.\u0027The central part of the country is going to get hot and humid,\u0027 Petersen said.\u0027In Southern California, the heat coming out of the deserts will expand and go into the valley areas.\u0027The hot, gusty winds out West have wreaked havoc on states battling wildfires.A growing wildfire destroyed more than 100 homes in the Colorado mountains, while other blazes across the parched U.S. West kept hundreds of other homes under evacuation orders Tuesday and derailed holiday plans.Nearly 60 large, active blazes are burning across the West, including nine in New Mexico and six each in Utah and California, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.In Utah, authorities have evacuated 200 to 300 homes because of a growing wildfire near a popular fishing reservoir southeast of Salt Lake City amid hot temperatures and high winds.          The hot, gusty winds out West have wreaked havoc on states battling wildfires. Hot Shot crews from Mendocino use backfires to help contain the County Fire along Highway 129 near Lake Berryessa in Yolo County, California on Tuesday          Fire burns the hillsides as the County Fire continues along Highway 129 near Lake Berryessa          Nearly 60 large, active blazes are burning across the West, including nine in New Mexico and six each in Utah and California, according to the National Interagency Fire Center          A helicopter dumps water as a wildfire burns near the Highland Meadows subision west of Cripple Creek, Colorado on Monday          Smoke rises from a wildfire as it continues to burn east of Strawberry Reservoir, in Wasatch County, Utah on TuesdaySeveral structures have been lost since the fire started Sunday, but it\u0027s unclear how many, said Jason Curry of the Utah Division of Forest, Fire and State Lands.Meanwhile, a wind-fueled wildfire in Northern California that continues to send a thick layer of smoke and ash south of San Francisco was threatening more than 900 buildings.The massive blaze was choking skies with ash and smoke, prompting some officials to cancel Fourth of July fireworks shows and urge people to stay indoors to protect themselves from the unhealthy air.At least 2,500 people have been told to evacuate as the so-called County Fire continues to spread, said Anthony Brown, a spokesman with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.So far this year, wildfires have burned 4,200 square miles in the United States, according to the fire center. That\u0027s a bit below last year\u0027s acreage to date - which included the beginning of California\u0027s devastating fire season - but above the 10-year average of 3,600 square miles.Because of the Independence Day holiday, authorities are also concerned about the possibility of campfires or fireworks starting new fires because of the dry, hot conditions.In Colorado, many communities have canceled firework displays, and a number of federal public lands and counties have some degree of fire restrictions in place, banning things like campfires or smoking outdoors.In Arizona, large swaths of national forests and state trust land have been closed since before Memorial Day. Some cities have canceled fireworks displays because of extreme fire danger.In New Mexico, all or part of three national forests remain closed because of the threat of wildfire, putting a damper on holiday camping plans. The forests that are open have strict rules, especially when it comes to fireworks.\u0027We\u0027re just urging people to use extreme caution,\u0027 said Wendy Mason, a spokeswoman for the New Mexico State Forestry Division.\u0027We want people to have fun and enjoy themselves, but we prefer they leave the fireworks shows to the professionals.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/07/4DE832B900000578-0-image-a-37_1530684947424.jpg","title":"Homeowner finds gold Brisbane property","story":"    A homeowner was shocked when he found a gold mine (pictured) in his backyard after buying a new house          Anthony Doolin purchased the Brisbane property (pictured) three years ago but was not aware of the gold mine at the time Upon closer inspection of the mine, it was discovered that it was six metres deep with the ironbark still intact.After doing a bit of research of the area, Mr Doolin found that there were a few other mines in the hills.Revealed: The prices real estate around Australia will reach...Share this article\u0027There was a lot of mining at the turn of the century and in those hills there are quite a few little mines,\u0027 Mr Doolin told the publication.  During his time there, Mr Doolin never ventured into the gold mine to find if there was gold in there, and had his mother sell the property.   The property was sold for $1.35 million last week, the same price Mr Doolin paid when he bought it.           The property was sold for $1.35 million last week, the same price Mr Doolin paid when he bought it Brisbane man¿s shock discovery of a gold mine in his backyard - realestate.com.au"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/07/4DE56C7800000578-0-Rebekah_Vardy_was_full_of_praise_as_her_husband_Jamie_met_her_in-m-3_1530685965821.jpg","title":"WAGs pride Englands wives girlfriends congratulate partners","story":"    Sealed with a kiss: Dele Alli of England kisses his girlfriend Ruby Mae following England\u0027s dramatic World Cup penalty shoot-out victory over Colombia last night  Sealed with a kiss: Rebekah Vardy was full of praise as her footballer husband Jamie met her in the stands following his team\u0027s sensational victory          England striker Marcus Rashford who scored a penalty in the dramatic shoot out embraces his girlfriend Lucia Loi in the stands after last night\u0027s dramatic victory          England defender Kieran Trippier rushed to the embrace of his wife Charlotte before picking up his son Jacob after the final whistle          Captain fantastic: England\u0027s talisman and the World Cup\u0027s leading goalscorer Harry Kane soaks up the adulation from his family after the final whistle.

Once, team mates overheard him telling Jordan he wouldn\u0027t make it with his attitude - to which the goalie replied \u0027I bet I will\u0027. Ball said: \u0027He thought he was the best. He knew he had potential and athletic ability. But you have to work hard to achieve that, and he has.\u0027He wanted to be in the first-team at 17 and was pushy, but I liked that. He challenged me.\u0027And, on the morning of his senior debut at Sunderland Pickford called his former coach, just to say thank you. Pickford is expected to start in England\u0027s game against Sweden on Saturday."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/09/4DE8945D00000578-0-image-a-11_1530692159638.jpg","title":"Colombian newspapers praise team fume referee","story":"Colombian newspapers have praised their national team for \u0027dying with their boots on\u0027 after they were knocked out of the World Cup by England          El Pais, one of the country\u0027s largest newspapers, ran with the headline \u0027Thanks Warriors!\u0027 and praised the team for never giving up          El Tiempo, the country\u0027s largest newspaper, ran the headline: \u0027Goodbye to the Russian World Cup with honour but without glory\u0027Speaking to pan-Latin American television station Telesur, he said: \u0027This referee knows a lot about baseball, but he has no idea about football.\u0027The World Cup winner was particularly incensed about the second-half penalty awarded to Harry Kane, saying it was the English striker\u0027s own fault.The race to Russia: England fans have until TOMORROW to get...Our heroes!

It showed him queueing to pay for fuel and, as he did so, suddenly putting his hand on the shoulder of the woman in front of him for no apparent reason.He then walked forward to the alleged victim\u0027s till and could be seen almost immediately reaching out to the woman\u0027s chest area with his left hand. It was clear in the video that her own hands did not leave the counter.Mr Gough claimed she had moved her polo shirt aside herself so he could read the rest of her tattoo - but the CCTV clearly showed that did not happen and he said he could not understand why not. During yesterday\u0027s trial the court heard that the woman cashier in a Gloucester shoppetrol station had a two line sentence about love tattooed just above her right breast. She said it was positioned so it would be covered up by her work polo shirt and she would look \u0027professional.\u0027When Mr Gough approached her, she said: \u0027Hhis fingers went on my top and pulled it down and to the right.\u0027He pulled it across to reveal the full length of my tattoo. His fingers were on the skin of my chest.\u0027She said she asked if he was trying to read the tattoo but he just grinned and did not really respond and he did not question her about it.\u0027When he pulled my top across he leaned his head down and started looking at it,\u0027 she said. \u0027I was quite shocked. I didn\u0027t know what to do. I just wanted to serve him and get him out of the shop.\u0027She estimated his hand was on her for about five seconds.\u0027It was part of my breast - the top part of my breast, a personal place,\u0027 she said. \u0027When he did go my stomach turned. It made me shake. I felt really uncomfortable, I felt like crying. But I didn\u0027t want to make a scene in front of the customers.          After a half-day trial the magistrates said they believed the woman\u0027s account of what happened but could not be sure beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Gough\u0027s actions were sexually motivated and so found him not guilty of sexual assault\u0027I turned to my colleague and said \u0027He just pulled my top across. Do you mind if I go?\u0027\u0027I felt overwhelmed and emotional. I contacted my mum and I burst into tears. I spoke to my manager and we decided to call the police.\u0027Cross-examined by Tim Burrows, for Mr Gough, she denied that he had asked her about whether the letters \u0027red\u0027 in the tattoo related to Manchester United or Ferrari. He said nothing of the kind, she insisted.Linda Mustoe, the woman in the queue in front of Mr Gough before the incident, told the court he stood quite close behind her and made her feel \u0027uncomfortable.\u0027\u0027Then I felt something touch me. It was a hand on my left shoulder,\u0027 she said. \u0027I quickly looked around and saw the man. He said sorry and moved back. \u0027She said while she was being served Mr Gough went to the next till and after he left she heard the cashier saying \u0027That man has just pulled my top down.\u0027\u0027She was distressed and I said, Actually, he made me feel uncomfortable too. He actually touched me.\u0027In evidence, Mr Gough said the woman\u0027s tattoo was up on her collarbone, not her breast, and he could only see the letters \u0027red\u0027 so he asked \u0027Are you Man U then, or Ferrari?\u0027\u0027She said \u0027Do you want to see it?\u0027 and I said \u0027I don\u0027t mind.\u0027 She pulled it to the side and she laughed.\u0027When I put my hand out I may have flicked her top, I don\u0027t know.\u0027After a half-day trial the magistrates said they believed the woman\u0027s account of what happened but could not be sure beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Gough\u0027s actions were sexually motivated and so found him not guilty of sexual assault.\u0027She said he took hold of her polo shirt and pulled it across to reveal her skin - the CCTV revealed he did,\u0027 said court chairman Andrew Tabor. \u0027He denied touching her at all although grudgingly admitted he might have flicked her clothing. He claimed she opened her shirt to show the tattoo even though CCTV evidence showed her hands not to leave her till.\u0027We are satisfied he did indeed touch her to reveal her tattoo.

It was a dark and horrible time.\u0027IVF is hard on your body and I wanted to give it our best shot. I felt we were missing out on life because we were concentrating so much on the IVF that life just stood still.\u0027Each IVF attempt cost around £3,000, so the couple had to save up each time they wanted to try again.\u0027With the last two eggs, we decided this was our final chance, we wouldn\u0027t try to do any more.\u0027The couple were thrilled when what would be Selina\u0027s final pregnancy test came back positive, but she was experiencing heavy bleeding and was terrified of losing the baby, so asked a colleague at the hospital where she worked to scan her at five weeks.She said: \u0027I hadn\u0027t told Kev because I didn\u0027t want to worry him.\u0027They told me there were four pregnancy sacs so potentially four babies and I was in utter disbelief.          The parents, who are hoping to move to a larger house before the big day, are planning to hold a family barbecue to celebrate their miracle quadruplets\u0027I phoned Kev to tell him and he thought I was joking. My colleague had to print out all the paperwork! I had been continuing to bleed heavily though so I didn\u0027t fully process the news.\u0027Two weeks later, Selina and Kev returned to the fertility clinic for the official scan and were stunned and overjoyed when the sonographer discovered four healthy heartbeats.She added: \u0027But we had quite a lot of negativity from the healthcare professionals and they wanted us to abort the identical triplets - which we didn\u0027t know at that time were three boys.\u0027They thought they probably wouldn\u0027t all survive, but we thought we would let fate take it\u0027s course.\u0027It was very difficult and we knew the risks were high but we decided to go ahead and accept that.\u0027We\u0027d already been through so much to complete our family. We hoped we could be the ones to defy the odds and so we plodded on.          Now the three boys - Roman, Austin and Arlo - who Selina describes as \u0027chilled out\u0027, and their tiny sister \u0027cheeky\u0027 Raeya, who still wears clothes designed for a three-month- old, are set to turn one.\u0027The pregnancy was tough but there were no major complications and I tried to do everything possible to keep them as safe as I could.\u0027It was disabling but I felt more and more reassured as I grew bigger.\u0027I needed help getting out of the bath, I passed out at every two week scan as we had due to the weight of all the babies pressing against my spine.\u0027At one point I even measured 4ft 8in wide for my 5ft 2in frame but I kept defying the odds and doctors were amazed.\u0027The quadruplets arrived 11 weeks early at 29 weeks gestation, being born on July 23 last year.Now the three boys - Roman, Austin and Arlo - who Selina describes as \u0027chilled out\u0027, and their tiny sister \u0027cheeky\u0027 Raeya, who still wears clothes designed for a three-month-old, are set to turn one.\u0027We got the boys bracelets with their initials on them so that we can tell them apart,\u0027 Selina joked.The parents, who are hoping to move to a larger house before the big day, are planning to hold a family barbecue to celebrate their miracle quadruplets.Selina added: \u0027One of the doctors joked with Kev that the odds were so slim, it is more likely he\u0027d win the jackpot than have quads.\u0027To think we thought we could never have children and now we are outnumbered by five is crazy, but I feel like we have won the lottery and it\u0027s better than anything money could buy.\u0027To have them all at home together for the first time was very overwhelming.\u0027Every time I look at them all, I feel incredibly proud. We did it, despite all the people who doubted us.\u0027I have always longed for a big family but had accepted that wouldn\u0027t happen for me - but our babies are proof that miracles do happen, and I feel so blessed.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/15/4DE8710C00000578-5917937-image-a-2_1530715874501.jpg","title":"Skydivers spell peace sky California","story":"    Dan Brodsky-Chenfeld makes the peace sign before jumping off with the rest of his squad, P3          The group, whose members are aged from 18 to 80, was trying to spread the message of positivity, encouraging peace in the world belowCiting \u0027recent political turmoil\u0027 as a key influence behind the stunt, the squad made the jump at 16,500ft under Dan\u0027s command.Chenfeld, a former captain of the US skying team and author of the book Above All Else, said: \u0027It\u0027s always a good time to be reminded of and striving for peace.\u0027I\u0027ve always wanted to do this jump, and with the political discourse we are experiencing in the US at the moment, it seemed there was no time better than right now.British er\u0027s mother cries as she reveals how his late...Hidden memorial on a hardware store wall marks a life lost...Share this article    The squad of 48 manage to align their bodies in perfect sync to create the word \u0027peace\u0027\u0027Skyers are the perfect group to carry this message.\u0027Most people think that all skyers are cut from the same mould - that couldn\u0027t be further from the truth.\u0027Skyers are the most erse group of people you could ever meet - we just  share the same passion for life, human flight and the freedom it takes to enjoy those that goes beyond all other issues.

The UK has limited supplies of tap water, and households that pour hundreds of gallons onto their garden are exacerbating a growing shortage and bringing a hosepipe ban ever nearer.Secondly, it’s a waste of effort better used elsewhere. Grass is a hardy plant which, in our climate, is almost impossible to kill. A lawn that looks parched today will quickly recover during a spell of wet weather.‘Never, ever water your lawn — it’s a complete waste of time, energy, money and everything,’ is the stern verdict of Stefan Buczacki, former Gardeners’ Question Time panellist. ‘As I look out of my study, the lawn has gone from green to cornfield brown. But I know it will return, and in the meantime I don’t need to bother mowing every week.’Getting your priorities rightIn nature, the weakest are always the most vulnerable. That means juvenile and new plants, which have yet to properly establish themselves, need the most looking after.In current conditions, anything you’ve planted in the past couple of years ought to be given extra help.Beyond that your priority should be the vegetables which are most vulnerable to drought.‘Courgettes, lettuces, tomatoes, cucumbers — the soft succulent vegetables where the bulk of the crop is made up of water — are obviously the ones that need it the most,’ says Buczacki.Vegetables such as cauliflowers ought to be left until the edible parts of the plant appear, and then watered liberally. The same goes for peas, beans and sweetcorn. Water them before their flowers appear and you’ll have huge plants with plenty of leaves, but not a lot of what you want to eat.Starve it of water and it’ll worry it’s about to die, so set about the business of reproducing — giving you a bigger crop in the process.Want to sunbathe naked during the heatwave? Make sure to...Britain screams for WATER! UK battles double crisis as taps...Share this articleThe best time to water is... 4 amTurning on the hose when the sun’s beating down is pointless: on a warm windy day, 18 per cent of water can evaporate before it even hits the ground. In extreme conditions, water drops can even act as a sort of magnifying glass, scorching healthy leaves.Logic dictates that gardeners should do the job at dusk, giving water plenty of time to work its way into the soil.But there’s a catch. ‘Typically, people get in from work, have a cup of tea and then turn on the hosepipe,’ says Guy Barter, chief horticulturalist at the Royal Horticultural Society.‘This means there’s a huge surge in demand at about 7pm, so the pressure in the system goes right down, and the job takes longer than it should. A better bet, if you can, is to do your watering when everyone else is in bed.’Barter says 4am is actually the best time for the job: there is very little drying wind at that hour, and lots of pressure in the system.You don’t have to be an insomniac to take advantage of these conditions, either: most garden centres sell timers that can be fitted to taps allowing them to do the job while you are asleep.Technique is everythingWatering little and often might sound like a good idea, but it’s a big mistake. By constantly adding moisture to the upper layer of the soil, you are encouraging plants to develop a shallow root system.For a plant to thrive, its roots need to grow as deep as possible.The correct technique, therefore, is to give each plant a thorough soaking every week or two. ‘Rather than giving the whole garden a light spray, you should concentrate your efforts on a few different plants each night,’ advises Barter.‘And to properly refresh the soil, you need much more water than you think — around four two-gallon watering cans full, for each square metre of ground.’And to ensure sufficient liquid actually ends up reaching your plants’ deep roots, he advises building a small bank of soil around the base of each plant before watering, thereby creating a small pool.    Follow our expert tips for the greenest grass and the prettiest plantsWhich beds need most water?This question ides the crowd. Buczacki takes a pragmatic approach, advising gardeners to water only the flowerbeds they see the most of.‘It’s for aesthetic value,’ he says. ‘So if you have a bed that’s 100 yards from the house, you have to ask yourself whether it’s worth the effort. But if it’s right next to you, and you get pleasure from it, then of course things are different.’Sometimes, as with vegetables, starving plants of water can actually make them flower better, adds Barter of the RHS. He recommends that plants in herbaceous borders get a good soaking every fortnight.‘Things like delphiniums and lupins are surprisingly resilient, even in real heatwaves.‘Then, after they have flowered, you can cut them back to ground level and, hopefully, they will re-flower in September.’Other experts are opposed to watering on principle. The late horticulturalist Beth Chatto, who died in May and laid out drought-resistant gardens for the Prince of Wales, took the view that all gardens ought to be able to survive local conditions, so designed flowerbeds to need no watering once they were established.Can you stop soil drying out?A layer of mulch, particularly made from tree bark, can prevent water evaporating from the soil. But beware, there’s no point laying it down now (unless you’ve first soaked the ground thoroughly for hours) since that will simply lock existing dryness in.If you do fancy mulching, add a small amount to the area immediately around each plant, straight after you have just given it a serious drenching.Best flowers for a heatwaveLook for plants that come from hot countries. Geraniums, for instance, are from South Africa, hate their roots getting too wet and are comparatively drought resistant. Ditto African marigolds.Herbs such as rosemary and thyme do especially well in the heat. So, too, does lavender.Plants in pots - a special caseAn exception to the ban on ‘little and often’ watering are plants in pots, which have comparatively small amounts of soil to survive on, so should be watered every day.If that job gets to be too much, the RHS advises transferring plants to bigger pots, which can retain more moisture, or moving them all into a shaded area.Pot plants standing in a single group are easier to water. And their close proximity to each other can create a micro-climate, helping them to retain moisture while other areas wilt in the heat. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/07/4DE56C7800000578-0-Rebekah_Vardy_was_full_of_praise_as_her_husband_Jamie_met_her_in-m-3_1530685965821.jpg","title":"WAGs pride Englands wives girlfriends congratulate partners","story":"    Sealed with a kiss: Dele Alli of England kisses his girlfriend Ruby Mae following England\u0027s dramatic World Cup penalty shoot-out victory over Colombia last night  Sealed with a kiss: Rebekah Vardy was full of praise as her footballer husband Jamie met her in the stands following his team\u0027s sensational victory          England striker Marcus Rashford who scored a penalty in the dramatic shoot out embraces his girlfriend Lucia Loi in the stands after last night\u0027s dramatic victory          England defender Kieran Trippier rushed to the embrace of his wife Charlotte before picking up his son Jacob after the final whistle          Captain fantastic: England\u0027s talisman and the World Cup\u0027s leading goalscorer Harry Kane soaks up the adulation from his family after the final whistle.

We had one little miracle - then we had four more.\u0027It is exhausting and totally insane but we wouldn\u0027t change it for the world.\u0027We look at our family and feel filled with so much love.\u0027Selina and Kev, a decorator, met in a local pub when Selina was just 19, and two years later they started trying for a baby after Selina\u0027s gynecologist told her she needed to get started as soon as possible.After three years of negative pregnancy tests and procedures such as ovarian drilling, where holes are made in the ovaries to help them release eggs, Selina was finally allowed to get IVF treatment on the NHS.          Quadruplets Roman, Arlo, Austin and Raey all snuggled up together. The quadruplets arrived 11 weeks early at 29 weeks gestation, being born on July 23 last yearSelina explained: \u0027We were trying all of those methods but nothing was working.\u0027It was a very hard time. We both wanted a family so much.\u0027I remember everyone around us was having children and we felt desperate to have that.\u0027When all of these things weren\u0027t working, I feared we\u0027d never be parents and we did talk about adoption and fostering.\u0027We wanted to try IVF but at that time you had to be at least 31 to have it on the NHS.Couple who\u0027ve been trying to conceive for 17 years have...Family heartbroken as father of sextuplets dies from a heart...Six of the best! Pakistani mother gives birth to sextuplet...Share this article\u0027I remember that just as I was coming up 24, that changed, and our GP called to say they dropped the age to 24.\u0027The IVF took three months. We didn\u0027t really have much hope that it was going to work, because everything else had failed.\u0027When we had IVF, we went in thinking it wasn\u0027t going to work - but it worked first time.\u0027In October 2014, Myla was born. When she was a year old, we thought we wanted to try again.\u0027The couple had just three frozen eggs remaining, and went through two more years of trying for another baby, spending their savings for a mortgage on the costly treatment.          Now three years old, Myla has her work cut out playing with identical triplet brothers and her little sister - the result of the two \u0027last chance\u0027 eggs, one of which split three waysSelina added: \u0027The second attempt at IVF failed. We were shocked because we had such high expectations after our first try with Myla - I was very upset by it.\u0027We were so desperate to complete our family. It was a dark and horrible time.\u0027IVF is hard on your body and I wanted to give it our best shot. I felt we were missing out on life because we were concentrating so much on the IVF that life just stood still.\u0027Each IVF attempt cost around £3,000, so the couple had to save up each time they wanted to try again.\u0027With the last two eggs, we decided this was our final chance, we wouldn\u0027t try to do any more.\u0027The couple were thrilled when what would be Selina\u0027s final pregnancy test came back positive, but she was experiencing heavy bleeding and was terrified of losing the baby, so asked a colleague at the hospital where she worked to scan her at five weeks.She said: \u0027I hadn\u0027t told Kev because I didn\u0027t want to worry him.\u0027They told me there were four pregnancy sacs so potentially four babies and I was in utter disbelief.          The parents, who are hoping to move to a larger house before the big day, are planning to hold a family barbecue to celebrate their miracle quadruplets\u0027I phoned Kev to tell him and he thought I was joking. My colleague had to print out all the paperwork! I had been continuing to bleed heavily though so I didn\u0027t fully process the news.\u0027Two weeks later, Selina and Kev returned to the fertility clinic for the official scan and were stunned and overjoyed when the sonographer discovered four healthy heartbeats.She added: \u0027But we had quite a lot of negativity from the healthcare professionals and they wanted us to abort the identical triplets - which we didn\u0027t know at that time were three boys.\u0027They thought they probably wouldn\u0027t all survive, but we thought we would let fate take it\u0027s course.\u0027It was very difficult and we knew the risks were high but we decided to go ahead and accept that.\u0027We\u0027d already been through so much to complete our family. We hoped we could be the ones to defy the odds and so we plodded on.          Now the three boys - Roman, Austin and Arlo - who Selina describes as \u0027chilled out\u0027, and their tiny sister \u0027cheeky\u0027 Raeya, who still wears clothes designed for a three-month- old, are set to turn one.\u0027The pregnancy was tough but there were no major complications and I tried to do everything possible to keep them as safe as I could.\u0027It was disabling but I felt more and more reassured as I grew bigger.\u0027I needed help getting out of the bath, I passed out at every two week scan as we had due to the weight of all the babies pressing against my spine.\u0027At one point I even measured 4ft 8in wide for my 5ft 2in frame but I kept defying the odds and doctors were amazed.\u0027The quadruplets arrived 11 weeks early at 29 weeks gestation, being born on July 23 last year.Now the three boys - Roman, Austin and Arlo - who Selina describes as \u0027chilled out\u0027, and their tiny sister \u0027cheeky\u0027 Raeya, who still wears clothes designed for a three-month-old, are set to turn one.\u0027We got the boys bracelets with their initials on them so that we can tell them apart,\u0027 Selina joked.The parents, who are hoping to move to a larger house before the big day, are planning to hold a family barbecue to celebrate their miracle quadruplets.Selina added: \u0027One of the doctors joked with Kev that the odds were so slim, it is more likely he\u0027d win the jackpot than have quads.\u0027To think we thought we could never have children and now we are outnumbered by five is crazy, but I feel like we have won the lottery and it\u0027s better than anything money could buy.\u0027To have them all at home together for the first time was very overwhelming.\u0027Every time I look at them all, I feel incredibly proud. We did it, despite all the people who doubted us.\u0027I have always longed for a big family but had accepted that wouldn\u0027t happen for me - but our babies are proof that miracles do happen, and I feel so blessed.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/04/15/4DE8710C00000578-5917937-image-a-2_1530715874501.jpg","title":"Skydivers spell peace sky California","story":"    Dan Brodsky-Chenfeld makes the peace sign before jumping off with the rest of his squad, P3          The group, whose members are aged from 18 to 80, was trying to spread the message of positivity, encouraging peace in the world belowCiting \u0027recent political turmoil\u0027 as a key influence behind the stunt, the squad made the jump at 16,500ft under Dan\u0027s command.Chenfeld, a former captain of the US skying team and author of the book Above All Else, said: \u0027It\u0027s always a good time to be reminded of and striving for peace.\u0027I\u0027ve always wanted to do this jump, and with the political discourse we are experiencing in the US at the moment, it seemed there was no time better than right now.British er\u0027s mother cries as she reveals how his late...Hidden memorial on a hardware store wall marks a life lost...Share this article    The squad of 48 manage to align their bodies in perfect sync to create the word \u0027peace\u0027\u0027Skyers are the perfect group to carry this message.\u0027Most people think that all skyers are cut from the same mould - that couldn\u0027t be further from the truth.\u0027Skyers are the most erse group of people you could ever meet - we just  share the same passion for life, human flight and the freedom it takes to enjoy those that goes beyond all other issues.

This year sees the annual AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme return, with new categories including the Women Entrepreneurs in Health Tech award, created to encourage and support women pioneering some of the most innovative health technology.It’s certainly not that women aren’t enthused by the world of technology. We’ve spoken to three finalists, budding health tech entrepreneurs – who happen to also be women – to find out about their experiences within the industry.BrightSign develops communication tech for children and sign language users. Its founder, Hadeel Ayoub, travelled with a team to South Korea during her PhD studies to take part in a global hackathon, entering a smart glove that translates sign language into text or speech. They won the competition, which led her to develop the technology further and create BrightSign.“The tech arena in general is definitely male dominated. In digital health specifically, when I take part in trade shows or give a talk in a conference, most often I am the only woman on the programme. I am not necessarily treated differently, but the look of surprise on people’s faces when I am walking to the podium, into a meeting or presenting my technology cannot be overlooked. My name doesn’t always give me away as a woman, so it has happened to me several times that I am mistaken for the assistant while ‘Mr Hadeel’ is coming shortly.”Although Ayoub is encouraged by the progress the industry is making when it comes to being more inclusive to women, she sometimes feels she can be treated like a box to tick.“I feel I have been invited to events so they can even out the numbers and check the inclusivity and ersity boxes. That’s a shame, because I would rather be included for my work, not my gender.“I have to say that in the past couple of months, I have been very happy to see other female names presenting, and CEOs no less. There are a few women in tech in London. We have joined together and meet up regularly to share our challenges and support each other.”Hsin-Hua Yu, known as Sheana, was inspired by her own experiences with scoliosis (curvature of the spine) to create Aergo, a low-cost, inconspicuous postural support system. Sheana, who graduated with a double master’s in global innovation design at the Royal College of Art and Imperial College London, was motivated by a research visit where she met with young people who used wheelchairs but struggled to sit comfortably and maintain a healthy posture.“Students and carers complained about the social stigma caused by not being able to sit upright, which led to people excluding them from conversations or activities. This motivated me to create a solution that helps children to break free from the need for constant assistance and build their self-confidence,” she says.Despite her complex and life-changing work, Sheana feels she faces something of an uphill struggle to be taken seriously.“As a female founder, I feel I have more to prove in front of colleagues, investors and business partners. I find the medical industry is particularly male-dominated and this can sometimes be quite intimidating. I’ve learned that by being clear, firm and professional, people begin to look past my gender and see me for my abilities.”Sheana would like to see a more “inclusive” health tech industry in future.“I’d like to see health tech designing solutions for all members of society. A lot of health tech today focuses on the medical condition and not the person. This often leads to a solution that can contribute to prejudice and social stigma. I believe in creating tech that is accessible to a wider range of users because it has the power to transform lives, remove social barriers, and change perceptions of disability within our culture.” Before creating iBreve, Wahl was working at Google’s legal department in Dublin and Boston. While travelling with her co-creator in Rishikesh, India – known as the yoga capital of the world – the pair saw an opportunity to combine breathing techniques from eastern culture with the western world and its modern stresses.“The growing trend of mindfulness and the increasing popularity of wearables reinforced our endeavour,” says Wahl. “We decided to focus initially on women’s health and wellbeing. So we designed a beautiful and discreet wearable that attaches to the bra and helps to improve stress resilience by analysing breathing patterns with machine learning.”Wahl wants to inspire more women and more ersity as a whole in the tech world.“Inspiring more girls and women to join the tech world is going to contribute to this ersity and benefits society with better answers to the current big challenges we face. My time at Google and at iBreve showed me that working together with a erse team from different backgrounds and with different experiences is productive, insightful and fun.”She would encourage women wanting to break into the health tech industry – and the tech industry as a whole – to listen to their instincts and follow what comes naturally.“The most important thing is to believe in yourself and do what you are passionate about. Trust your instincts and share your ideas and passion with others.”We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream. Innovations in health technology are transforming the way we care for our minds and bodies.

The business entered administration in May and had already shed more than 400 jobs before Wednesday’s announcement. The latest retail job losses come as more than 30,000 jobs are at risk in the UK following mass closure announcements by major chains including House of Fraser, New Look and Marks \u0026amp Spencer. Retailers are suffering from rising costs and the switch to online shopping just as hard-pressed consumers rein in spending. A report out this week predicts nearly 70,000 high street jobs will disappear this year unless action is taken to reinvigorate town centres and revamp business rates.Calvetron, which sold clothing from 300 outlets in department stores such as Debenhams, House of Fraser, and M\u0026ampCo, called in administrators from Duff \u0026amp Phelps after struggling to cope with high costs and falling sales. Administrators had continued to trade while they sought a buyer but on Wednesday said no viable offers had been received.The closures mark the final demise of a business founded in 1972 by Jack Cynamon and Alan Green, tailors from the East End of London. In 1977 they used their names, with a French twist, to create the Jacques Vert clothing brand.The group, which was once listed on the London Stock Exchange, has been through numerous iterations. It was bought out of administration only last year by a group of businessmen led by Sandeep Vyas and Haseeb Aziz.Benjamin Wiles of Duff \u0026amp Phelps said: “Calvetron Brands has faced the perfect storm of extremely difficult trading conditions on the high street, rising costs and low customer confidence all of which hindered our ability to secure a buyer.“We have explored a number of potential options, however no viable offers for the business as a going concern have been received. As such we are now having to close the remaining concessions here in the UK and Ireland as well as Canada and move to trade-out the stock.”The concession closures will lead to 500 retail redundancies in the UK and 90 job cuts at the group’s head offices in Birmingham and London. A further 250 jobs will be lost in Canada. The administrators said it would retain between 20 and 30 staff at Calvetron’s head office to assist with selling final stocks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57bfb05b8dec05a3ceaeb193116db12949babf88/0_230_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=726d55fd89f88c2f7a486302483eb2f9","title":"ryanair crew could join pilots strike action over pay and conditions","story":"Representatives say little progress made, as 100 pilots due to walk out on 12 JulyRyanair crew have warned they could join pilots in taking industrial action this summer after presenting the chief executive, Michael O’Leary, with a list of demands.Speaking after a summit in Dublin, representatives of cabin and ground crew from across Europe said there had been little progress since O’Leary reversed a long-held policy of refusing to recognise trade unions more than six months ago.The intervention by crew on Wednesday comes 24 hours after about 100 pilots at Ryanair’s Dublin base said they had agreed to walk out on 12 July.The Irish no-frills carrier agreed to recognise trade unions for the first time in December last year, narrowly averting widespread Christmas strikes, after a staffing crunch gave pilots the upper hand in negotiations over pay and conditions.However, pilots, cabin crew and ground crew are complaining that since then the airline has not done enough to improve their terms. The International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), a union umbrella body that represents crew at the vast majority of Ryanair’s bases, listed demands after the summit ranging from improvements to economic conditions to safety and rostering and workplace culture.They also urged Ryanair to take steps to do away with more precarious agency employment, give staff the right to sick pay and end strictly enforced sales targets for products such as scratchcards.“If Ryanair fails to respond promptly and appropriately then it risks industrial action over the summer,” the ITF said.Campaigns director Liz Blackshaw said O’Leary’s concession on trade union recognition was starting to look like an “empty promise”.“Because of conditions that have existed for many, many years, staff are frustrated that there isn’t any significant progress. We’re not expecting transformational change overnight but, given the promises made publicly in December, we’d have expected some change by now.“There haven’t been any and workers and unions are clear on the fact that this is unacceptable.”Ryanair said the demands were “pointless”, listing benefits it said crew already enjoyed.“Ryanair is already engaged in extensive negotiations with national cabin crew unions across Europe during which all of these, and other issues, are being negotiated and we have already concluded agreements in the UK and Italy,” a spokesperson said.But a trade union official in Spain said cabin crew in Spain, Portugal, Italy and Belgium from the SITCPLA union were already planning to announce dates for a walkout on Thursday.Strikes threaten to cause huge disruption for holidaymakers flying with Ryanair, Europe’s largest short-haul airline by far with about 130 million passengers per year.While Ryanair has been forced to negotiate with pilots and crew, partly due to cancellations caused by persistent staff rota problems, its financial performance has been largely unaffected by labour rights disputes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/214be697ec261c371001299f5bdb80b6b0a701bf/0_146_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85cd98518af3b55a1cc2a1f7d9c2b708","title":"world cup and hot weather boost supermarkets food sales","story":"Celebratory mood reflected in sales of beer, barbecue food and ice-creamEngland’s progress in the World Cup – combined with an uninterrupted run of hot weather – is giving UK supermarkets a multimillion pound sales fillip as shoppers stock up with beer, barbecue food and ice-cream.Retailers said their sales reflected the wider celebratory mood, with fans watching the games from home shelling out for football parties and al fresco gatherings before games. Over the last week sales of BBQ foods, salads, ice-cream, beer, and wine have been the most popular items bought at Tesco, which predicted a further sales uplift in the run-up to England’s quarter-final game with Sweden on Saturday afternoon. Demand for beer at the UK’s largest retailer last week was the strongest this year, and it predicted sales would be higher this week. It also reported the best summer barbecue meat sales for several years. By the end of this week Tesco expects to have sold more than 1m burgers and,1m hot dog rolls, 6m ice lollies, around 1m tubs of ice-cream, almost 50m bottles or cans of beer and close to 1m bottles of wine. “Fantastic weather and the world’s biggest sporting event are creating a real carnival atmosphere across Britain this week,” said Tesco barbecue meats buyer, Natalie Bastow. “The mere mention of a heatwave is enough to change shopping plans and judging by sales many people are enjoying al fresco dining right now.” The British Retail Consortium predicted consumers would embark on a £90bn spending spree over the summer – which includes TVs and barbecues – as a buoyant mood swept the UK.“The fantastic temperatures – and the World Cup – have meant that shoppers have been coming in their droves this week to buy frozen food and drink,” said Nigel Broadhurst, Iceland’s managing director."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7571f5e61f7f17381531ffb4a30d9491aadbcfcd/0_327_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dd0e4a25234cb637afebbd1abc21376","title":"from solar torches to bioloos five frugal innovations from around the world","story":"Not everyone wants to send rockets into space. For these innovators, a cheap, effective, no-frills product is the goalWhether it’s bringing quality healthcare closer to those residing in rural villages or providing people with facilities as basic and necessary as toilets, it’s sometimes wise not to overcomplicate things. Frugal innovation, based on the Indian concept of jugaad – innovating when there are limitations in resources – can provide an answer when capital is low, resources are scarce, or infrastructure is in need of upgrading.Here are five businesses putting frugality at the forefront of innovation.Peek Vision works with partners to improve access to high-quality eye care using the Peek Acuity and Peek Acuity Pro smartphone vision-test apps, and Peek Retina, a smartphone adapter for examining inside the eye. The apps, which are designed by eye care professionals, enable anyone to examine a patient’s eyes and assess the quality of their sight. The patient is shown a letter in the app and has to identify it as it increases and decreases in size and changes direction. The patient’s answers are graded by the app, which also determines their score at the end of the test.For people living in remote parts of the world, accessing healthcare can mean travelling a considerable distance – especially problematic when there are medical emergencies.With ClickMedix, an app that enables health workers to screen, diagnose and refer patients on for treatment, villagers can avoid the lengthy travel times – and the associated costs. The app works by taking local health professionals through a questionnaire, guiding them to ask patients appropriate questions and then directing them to the relevant treatment or referral options. The app can be used to screen patients for a number of conditions, including HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, diabetes, heart disease and cancer.Ting Shih, ClickMedix CEO and founder, says: “What’s important about frugal innovation is that you’re empowering the local people to see the power and to know that there are solutions and to help deliver the solutions, which then actually enables true adoption.”From shopping to streaming, the internet has changed the way many of us conduct our everyday lives - but the same isn’t true for rural areas with poor connectivity.Launching across the Ivory Coast this July, Dor2Dor – a delivery service powered by Be-Bound’s augmented connectivity technology – is set to transform the delivery landscape for people in remote areas. Parcels will be delivered within 48 hours, including to homes without conventional addresses. Deloitte estimates that over five years Dor2Dor will create 100,000 new jobs directly, and a further 500,000 indirectly.Mélanie Delaroche Curtil, communications assistant at Be-Bound, says: “The beauty of frugal innovation is that it is right in front of us. It is making something new with something old.” The award-winning Frontier Markets collaborates with consumers and local entrepreneurs on solutions that put the customer first. Its solar torch, designed by and for rural women, is one example. Women living in rural India are disproportionately affected by the negative effects of limited access to energy and have fewer income-generating opportunities. They can use the torches for personal use or be trained to sell them. The torch costs less than $20 and is more efficient than market alternatives that use lead-acid batteries. Currently, Frontier Markets works across 22 districts in Rajasthan with a network of 1,000 women entrepreneurs.In response to India’s often-limited sanitation facilities – with 626 million people practicing open defecation – Banka BioLoo was born. The brainchild of Namita Banka, the company’s chief executive and founder, bioloos tackle the lack of secure, dignified and eco-friendly places to go to the toilet in some areas of India.The bioloos treat human waste with bacterial cultures, meaning off-site disposal and treatment of excrement is not required. As a result, transport of human waste is eliminated, reducing pollution. And, because the bioloos are found in 20 states across India, in everything from trains and schools to communities and hospitals, more people can safely use the toilet, decreasing instances of open defecation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bd2829520384706c4a631eeaa8048b1874f91a6/21_0_4959_2976/master/4959.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e6f2c05ff8616ed406bcc2c5d8e9e4b","title":"in big tech v big retail the real losers are store workers sears amazon","story":"It’s becoming a common story across America: the opening of an Amazon ‘fulfilment center’ hastens the end of local department stores, like this Sears in Sacramento Photographs by Robert GumpertIn the Sacramento area of northern California, an Amazon fulfilment centre came online last year, striking, it would seem, another blow to the local outlets of Sears, one of America’s signature brick and mortar department stories. spoke to Sears workers at the Sunrise Mall in Citrus Heights who were told earlier this year the store would be closing down. That Sears store and another outlet nearby in Roseville are slated to close by 15 July, following announcements by the Sears Holding Company in March and April heralding the closure of more than 100 stores.“Since April, the inventory here is being handled by a liquidation company, so it doesn’t sync with Sears’ website. People might say ‘This cost $63 online’, but we might sell it to them for $53. Or $73.It’s sad. Customers are coming up to me and saying how they’ve been shopping here for 40 years. Our older employees who’ve been here a while all live nearby. So, yeah, it’s rough. What will I do when the store closes? I’ll go back to college. And apply to work at Costco.”“I got here four months ago and, my first day on the job, they announced the store is closing. I had hoped to make some money, to look after myself, to help my dad with the bills. But all of those hopes went down.Later this month there will be an expo for other stores to come and interview our employees and see if any of us are a good match for them. After the initial announcement, a couple of workers quit. One guy had been here 20 years, and they’d never raised his pay. He was earning $11 an hour, like me.Would I work at the nearby Amazon fulfilment center? I didn’t know there was one. Yeah, I’d be interested in that.”“I got here in 1998 – 20 years ago! But after 9-11 I was called up by the air force reserves and spent three years in Qatar. So I’ve been here parts of 17 years. I’ve been down here on the bottom floor long enough that I’ve pretty much mastered the art of selling. This was a day we all kind of saw coming. There was the recession, and we never really bounced back from the real-estate crisis, and Amazon took off in 2011 or so. So I predicted this, but I thought we’d have a little more time. As recently as three years ago, this store was still in tip-top shape. But then the losses to Amazon really began mounting up. These last three-to-five years is when it really began to show. How did I react when I got the news the store was closing? Well, it was my birthday. I got an email. Thankfully, we had already gone out to eat and I didn’t find out until the end of the night. And I was shocked … but not totally shocked. I am retired air force, but I’ll still need to work. I will press on, possibly with Sears. Post-9-11, I’ve been thinking of getting into healthcare, so I could help people out. And there are opportunities with Gulfstream (the aerospace company). And I may just take some time off. I live right here in Citrus Heights. I walk to work. I am going to miss that.”“The tragedy for the community is a demographic one. People are ageing out. I’ve lived here more than 20 years I’ve seen all this. People are going online or going to specialty stores. So Sears is experiencing what every traditional American business is: there’s pressure to either enhance the personal connection, or it’s super-duper price-driven. I understand this because I worked in supermarkets for years, and the trend is either toward Whole Foods or, on the other end of the spectrum, toward Walmart. It’s a real polarisation.Also, our being in the middle of suburbia is not ideal we’re 20 or 30 minutes from the freeway, depending on traffic. I recently completed my master’s in Asian and Pacific studies at the University of San Francisco. This store’s closure was both gradual and sudden – like the death of a loved one. And for me, as an aspiring academic, this is both a gentle push and an abrupt shove.”“Our parents shopped at Sears, as did our parents’ parents. So it’s real sad. This is an old store, and most Sears are old. I’ve been here, I don’t even know how many years. I’ve lost count. More than 20. It’s my home away from home. And it’s hard to find another home, especially when you get older. This store is closing because of – what do you call it? – Amazon. People shopping online. But this store was in the black! Our lease was not renewed Sears did not own this building, it sold it and was leasing it back. And now I bet they’re gonna tear it down.Our last day here is June 23 and our last selling day is the ninth. And, on top of that, we were ripped off the other night. Two guys got our Oakley and Ray-Ban frames, like, 76 of them. They’re worth like $170 to $200 a frame that’s about $14,000. It’s just the icing on the cake. What a punch in the gut. I use that clock for all my clients. After they put on their glasses, I ask them, ‘Can you see that clock? What time is it?’ It’s sad: the kids, they don’t know how to tell time on an analogue clock.”“I go around the store talking to people about improvements in their home – roofs, bathrooms, kitchens – and set up appointments. I am the only person in the store doing this. After this store closes, I am going to be reassigned to either the Arden Fair mall or our outlet at McClellan air force base. How do I feel about that? If they put me at McClellan, it’ll be more convenient for me than it is now.”After this? I got an offer. From Sam’s Jewelers, here in the mall. But I want a break. After 10 years I want a break. I volunteer at Casa Garden, which benefits the Sacramento Children’s Home. My husband is a master gardener at UC Davis. We are going to do some gardening. And I have two sons who are doctors – a surgeon in Texas and an ear-nose-throat specialist in West Virginia. I am going to do some travelling. Look, I don’t want to shop on the internet I want to put my hands on the materials. A lot of people are like that. Especially our older customers. They know us. They are our regulars. They don’t like change. They are not computer-literate. A lot of my colleagues are looking for full-time jobs. So it’s sad for the customers. And it’s sad for us.”This week  Cities takes a deeper look at the relationship between tech and US cities, asking whether tax giveaways are worth the cost.

But in its current home, critics say rising house prices and growing inequality have damaged the cityImage shows Seattle from 2015 to 2017by  Chris McGreal in SeattleHowever they see Amazon, for good or ill, residents of the fastest-growing city in the US largely agree on the price Seattle has paid to be the home of the megacorporation: surging rents, homelessness, traffic-clogged streets, overburdened public transport, an influx of young men in polo shirts and a creeping uniformity rubbing against the city’s counterculture.But the issue of Jeff Bezos’s balls is far from settled. “Have you seen the Bezos balls?” asked Dave Christie, a jewellery maker at a waterfront market who makes no secret of his personal dislike for the man who founded and still runs Amazon. “No one wanted them. They’ve disfigured downtown. Giant balls say everything about the man. Bezos is holding Seattle hostage.”It’s not strictly true to say everyone is against the three huge plant-forested glass spheres at what Amazon calls its “campus” in the heart of the city. The Bezos balls, as the conservatories are popularly known, are modelled on the greenhouses at London’s Kew Gardens, feature walkways above fig trees, ferns and rhododendrons, and provide hot-desking for Amazon workers looking for a break from the neighbouring office tower. “They are absolutely gorgeous. There was nothing in that area 10 years ago,” said Jen Reed, selling jerky from another market stall. “I don’t hate Amazon the way that a lot of people hate them. Seattle has changed a lot. My rent’s gone from $500 to $1,000, but outside of that Amazon have been beneficial. It’s give and take, and anyway we invited them here.”But even those sympathetic to the biggest retailer in the US are questioning whether there has been more take than give. Amazon has long been accused of stretching the city’s transit and education systems, and its highly paid workers have driven up prices of goods and housing.The resentful murmur recently became a roar after Amazon reacted to the city’s latest tax proposal, which would have charged large businesses an annual $275 per employee, by resorting to what critics call blackmail. In mid-June, less than a month after unanimously passing the tax, Seattle’s council abandoned it in the face of threats from the corporation. The tension has sharpened the debate about whether the city can retain its identity as one of the most progressive in the country, or is destined to be just another tech hub.Ironically, given Amazon’s much-publicised “city sweepstakes”, in which municipalities in North America are competing to land the company’s second headquarters, Seattle did not reach a Faustian pact with Amazon to lure it in the first place. The city gave no tax breaks and passed no anti-union laws, although the fact that Washington state law bars income tax was certainly appealing. The council did encourage the firm’s massive growth, however, with accommodations on building regulations that helped drive $4bn in construction.John Burbank of the Economic Opportunity Institute said there is a a direct link between the surge in highly paid jobs and the numbers of people forced on to the street.Amazon has sought to improve its standing with financial support for organisations such as Mary’s Place to build a new shelter for 200 homeless women and families. It is a similar story as schools and public transportation grapple to keep up with the rapidly rising population and the demographic shift it is causing.  But still the flow of cars to the Amazon campus has led to long traffic jams to the interstate. The bus route to the same area, the No 8, is notorious as one of the most overcrowded and delayed in the city, prompting a derisory Twitter account with the slogan “You can’t say late without 8!”.In other cities, rising salaries would be a boon to public coffers, but Seattle is burdened with one of the most regressive tax systems in the country.“As a result we’re leaving millions of dollars on the table that should be going into public investments in our state and in our city. We’re increasing taxes on the people who can least afford to pay taxes and we’re letting the affluent off the hook.”This is not how large numbers of people in Seattle think things should work. They argue that Amazon should contribute to upgrading a transport system that’s struggling under the influx it created, and improving schools that provide the educated workforce the company benefits from. “It is sort of a bipolar relationship because we do have a progressive city in some respects, we have a progressive city council in some respects, and then we have an environment that embraces inidual wealth,” said Burbank.“So if it has to do with personal freedom, that’s OK. But if it has to do with actually trying to create a shared quality of life which entails taxation of the affluent or higher taxation, that’s not OK. And so this is a really good city for him because we have a lot of personal freedom and we have no taxation. Of course chickens are going to come home to roost at some point.” Bezos’s company has arguably done much to erode the liberal and progressive culture of the city that first attracted him. Unlike other locally based giant corporations such as Microsoft, Starbucks and Boeing, Amazon planted itself in the heart of the city, and the influx of well-paid tech workers has changed the feel of Seattle. Keenan-Lai sees it in the erosion of the identity of her old neighbourhood on the city’s Capitol Hill and the disappearance of older, quirky restaurants, driven out by newer, more polished places. “I can’t begrudge people moving to try to find opportunity,” she said. “But I do hear a lot of people say ‘I don’t want those programmers coming to Seattle’. It does create a lot of tension. Amazon represents both innovation and progress, and also dystopian fears for a lot of folks.” Reed, at the market stall, added: “It’s definitely weird when you go into a e bar that used to have bike gangs and now everyone’s in a polo shirt.”The city council has struggled to find a path that remains true to Seattle’s progressive values while keeping the source of much of its recent prosperity happy. In 2015 it became the first major US city to increase its minimum wage to $15 an hour. Keenan-Lai said 100,000 people – then quarter of the working population of the city – benefited from the measure, but that its impact was swiftly eroded. “The increase in the cost of housing has exceeded the increase in wages,” she said. “When we were advocating for $15 an hour the idea was that everyone who lived in Seattle could afford to live here. Our housing market just skyrocketed.”Seattle, forced by the lack of an income tax to hunt for innovative means of raising revenue, has run into resistance from Amazon at every turn. The friction peaked over the recent worker tax, which was expected to raise around $50m a year to help pay for affordable housing and services for people made homeless by escalating rents and property prices. Amazon, however, in actions critics called blackmail, characterised it as a “jobs tax”, threatened to freeze construction in the city and backed a petition drive to put the issue to a popular vote in November.The city’s chamber of commerce and other businesses threw their weight behind the ballot initiative. Popular support for the measure collapsed amid accusations that it would cost jobs and that the money would not be put to good use because the council lacks a coherent strategy to cope with the homeless crisis. Under pressure from Amazon, the council broke, and only two of the city’s nine councillors voted to keep the tax. One of them, Kshama Sawant, a member of Socialist Alternative, accused the council of a “cowardly betrayal” and called Bezos “our enemy”.Sawant, a driving force behind the $15 minimum wage, said it would be a mistake to expect Amazon to behave any differently. The company, she said, could easily afford the tax but opposed it for ideological reasons.“It’s not a tax on jobs,” she said. “It is not a tax on employees. It’s a tax on big business. For the people who would actually be paying this, it is pocket change, and yet they are fighting fiercely against it. ‘Good corporate citizen’ is an oxymoron, because Jeff Bezos and the billionaire class have no incentive to do the right thing.”Amazon has said that while it opposed the worker tax, it is “deeply committed to being part of the solution”, and points to its support of nonprofits in the city. The company declined to comment for this article.Critics are not persuaded. Some see the company as attempting to shape a future in which Seattle’s residents are dependent on Amazon’s largesse through the funding of NGOs to deal with social issues, giving the company undue power at the expense of democratic institutions. “Amazon is very much, ‘We want to save the world too, let’s do it together.’ And then as you get into the details, not so much,” said Keenan-Lai. “There is a lot of benefit we provide to Amazon but the city has had a really hard time extracting benefit from the company in return.” Still, Keenan-Lai said the city’s history of progressive struggle is deep-rooted. “There’s been a long understanding that corporations can’t continue doing what they’re doing,” she said. “In Seattle, we’ve been fighting back for a long time.”This week  Cities takes a deeper look at the relationship between tech and US cities, asking whether tax giveaways are worth the cost.

And why do you feel compelled to reminisce about the summer of 1976, although you don’t actually remember it?This is a complete and unabridged account of the experience of being middle-aged in a heatwave, which you wouldn’t wish upon a dog. Some build-up of brain bacteria over time compels you to mention climate change whenever there is any weather anywhere, but you remember from the 90s that everybody hates that person, so it’s better to just head off weather chat mildly, absent-mindedly – “Hot? I suppose it is” – and this gives you a bumbling, professorial air, as if you don’t notice the world because you’re busy thinking about Frankfurt School Marxists, except what you’re really thinking is: “I am way too hot.”You can’t wear jeans because it’s like being stitched alive into your own nuclear-resistant shroud, which is the same for everyone except the difference is you don’t have anything but jeans. What happened to all your T-shirt dresses and chiffon? Surely you once owned shorts? For the love of God, even some clamdiggers would help. You must have had a ritualistic bonfire of the fripperies, not planning for this eventuality, even though some kind of summer, realistically, will happen every other year. How is it possible to live so long, and accrue so little basic weather wisdom?You are compelled to reminisce about 1976, even though you don’t remember it any better than a millennial so you have to go on the internet and Google your own nostalgia. Did you know, by the way, that after two historically dry months, they appointed Denis Howell minister for drought, then three days later, thunderstorms arrived and it didn’t stop raining until Christmas? But before that, he tried to boost the national water-saving effort by inviting reporters to watch him taking a bath with his wife, and that’s the kind of politics – desperate, histrionic, obscurely sleazy, yet endowed with magical powers – that you don’t see twice in a lifetime, however hot it is.Around about day four of any given heatwave, a certain seen-it-all-before ennui beds in, because wasn’t the year before last exactly like this, only more so? No, that was 2003. That incredibly recent year, when you stood on a tube platform reading about the temperature at which the cells of the human body start to change composition and can never change back, like scrambled egg? It was 15 years ago. That’s why you’re wearing a skirt in this memory, and reading “43C” on paper, not a screen.You’re too young to be in anyone’s heat health news story, and too old to take it as an invitation to drink all day. You have too many pets who are, themselves, too hot. You are just shy of the sun-cream native generation, so it’s a huge mental effort to remember it and you don’t like the smell. If you’re a man, the sun has blazed through your cycle helmet and you have stripes of tan on your bald pate, like a badger. If you’re a woman, you wake up every morning thinking, is this a hot flush? Then you remember, no, it’s just hot, and then you wonder why your memory is so bad, realising that is the other harbinger, and you’re locked in a cycle of “menopause-or-not?” that lasts roughly the entire day. Young people probably don’t know why their boss is in such a bad mood, but you do: it’s because they’re slightly dehydrated and their gout is flaring up. You worry about your garden, but never quite enough to take measures to make sure nothing dies. You do not want to paddle, and ice-cream does nothing for you. And then, when it’s over, all you can remember is how much you loved it.The best thing about Danny Dyer’s Brexit analysis last week was that he called David Cameron a twat on primetime telly the second best thing was that he said it twice and the third best thing was that he pronounced it with two syllables (ter-WAT), which, in the way of something truly inimitable, I can’t stop trying to imitate. But he crammed another gobbet of genius into 30 seconds, when he said the whole business was like a mad riddle.Michael Gove, in the intervening days, mulling the business over in whatever Crazed Bringers of the New World WhatsApp group is running this shitshow, clearly decided on a jujitsu move. They’re calling it a mad riddle: let’s give them a mad riddle. Later, we can tell them the people of Britain voted for a mad riddle. Nobody will be able to remember whether “mad riddle” was ever on a ballot sheet they’ll have to just shrug, and say, I suppose so. It certainly seems to come up a lot.This dastardly plan, somewhere between gaslighting and a more totalitarian insistence that black is white, launched yesterday on the Today programme. “I’m not going to comment,” said Gove, “on what I have read or I haven’t read.” He said it many times over. Why not? Well, it was obvious, numbnuts: he wasn’t going to, because he wasn’t going to. Then he couldn’t comment because he “wasn’t a commentator”. Then he couldn’t comment on the Electoral Commission’s report because he hadn’t seen it, though by that stage he could at least comment on what he had seen or hadn’t seen. It was like a mad riddle: what would make him comment? Should Mishal Husain have switched the word order of the question, while rubbing his tummy? Was there a way to turn him off and then turn him back on again? It’s like being governed by a gnome on a humpbacked bridge. It’s great you’re all so happy, but it would have been better to have not won the football. The expectations are too great: half the country now thinks it’s going to win the whole bloody thing the other half thinks this, and that it will bring the nation together after months of bitter ision. It’s got into the water supply as proof that, however bad things look, we’ll all triumph in the end, which is the worst possible thing to think. It’s not that I’m not patriotic, I just can’t stand to watch the disappointment. I said that to my mister, and he said: “Ah. Married to the hard left.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16d80cb0e5383a2262c632b6536aed5d2dde4af7/0_85_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77c8479459fd8cf7f2d24794a7e57fc0","title":"labour low wage jeremy corbyn policies leave voters","story":"Jeremy Corbyn should be streets ahead in the polls. But his lifestyle policies put off too many people in leave-voting placesIn sporting terms, this doesn’t signify much. Politically, though, it’s fascinating because the smaller, less fashionable towns of Britain are going to be crucial in deciding who wins the next general election. Jeremy\u0026nbspCorbyn can’t win unless he does so in the sort of places represented in Moscow. These, though, are precisely the parts of England where Labour is doing badly.Opinion polls suggest that the Conservatives have a small lead over Labour, which is remarkable given that Theresa May presides over a shambolic government, is making a complete Horlicks of the Brexit negotiations, and, as things stand, will go down in history as the worst prime minister of the postwar era.Put simply, Labour should be streets ahead in the opinion polls – and would be, if the only people who could vote were young graduates living in university towns and large cities. But Labour needs a broader coalition to win an election, and it is increasingly being deserted by one part of the coalition that has historically won it parliamentary majorities – working-class voters living in the less glitzy parts of the country. This has not happened overnight. There have been signs of a drift away from Labour among working-class voters since the middle of the last decade, but the seriousness of the problem only really became evident in the 2017 election, when Corbyn’s strong performance was marred by the loss of seats in places that would once have been considered rock solid: Middlesbrough, Stoke-on-Trent, Mansfield.As a report from the Policy Network thinktank showed, this is not simply a matter of poverty. Labour under Corbyn has done well among those on the very lowest incomes and in the most deprived parts of the country, which tend to be inner-city seats. It has done far less well in seats that are both suffering from deprivation and where economic decline has been the most pronounced. “Labour’s fortunes have declined most in areas – typically post-industrial towns – that have not experienced recovery since the 2008 crash, and in some cases have never really recovered since the decline of the 1970s and 1980s, failing to provide new and quality job opportunities. It has improved most in inner cities that, despite still exhibiting high levels of poverty, deprivation and inequality, are on the up and connected to the global economy.”Labour’s control over the big cities outside of Scotland means it has to look elsewhere for gains at the next election. Of Corbyn’s top 100 target seats, 63 are in England, of which 49 are “town” constituencies, where recent performance – in both the 2017 general election and the 2018 local government elections – has been poor. Combating this political trend is not going to be easy, and can begin only once Labour accepts that it can’t win if white, working-class voters desert the party. Some Labour MPs – especially the ones representing northern seats – get this. In her recent pamphlet Rachel\u0026nbspReeves, the Leeds West MP, says that remain supporters (of whom she is one) have to understand that the one-third of Labour voters who backed leave did so as an “expression of deep anger at the way the governing class had ignored them and belittled their concerns about their national culture and identity”.She is spot on about this. Labour’s affluent, liberal, middle-class wing tends to find the displays of patriotism during World Cups disturbing, even a tad repellent. As good global citizens and staunch opponents of nationalism they would never dream of driving around with an England flag on their car or draping one out of their bedroom window. They are fond of other countries but not their own.But, as George Orwell once said, you can be a patriot without being a nationalist. Patriots think the country they live in is the best in the world but have no wish to force it on others. Nationalism, he said, was inseparable from the lust for power. Orwell was writing at a time when Labour was part of the wartime coalition, and the voters who would eventually make Clement Attlee prime minister were in uniform or doing their bit on the home front. These were patriotic radicals who saw themselves as fighting on two fronts: to win the war, and to bring about structural change in the way that Britain was run.Corbyn has a radical agenda too, but he won’t get the chance to implement it while voters in target seats feel despised for loving their country. That simply breeds distrust, and fosters the belief that Labour’s middle-class, white-collar wing is more interested in reforming lifestyles of which it disapproves than it is in reforming capitalism. Telling someone with a low-paid, insecure job in a town hollowed out by globalisation that the answer to their problems is a sugar tax, mandatory parenting classes and drinking less has its limitations as a vote-winning strategy.It is quite remarkable, given the role played by Thatcherism in closing the mines and the factories of the Midlands and the north, that May is picking up support in towns such as Mansfield. That, though, reflects the fact that deindustrialisation continued under Labour between 1997 and 2010. It also reflects a sense of abandonment by many erstwhile voters in the struggling parts of Britain. Labour’s historic mission was to use the power of the state to empower working people, not to use the power of the state to control their lives. The party would do well to remember that before it loses millions of votes for ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fb1581dd690957f414f93d14bf076f26f8083f2/670_121_3429_2057/master/3429.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad9478ad79039c5b43d2ace8b72ac67c","title":"the guardian view on regulating elections democracy needs a tougher defence","story":"A healthy democracy has many mechanisms to hold politicians to account, but none as mighty as the ballot box. The government that fails to fulfil its promises can be expelled from power. This contract between electorate and elected is one reason why many democrats are suspicious of referendums. The danger is that they elevate a one-off verdict above the normal constitutional process. A failing government can be sacked, but what about a failing idea?This hazard has been realised since June 2016. Vote Leave, the official campaign for Brexit, celebrated its victory by disbanding. It features in the news now only because it is accused of breaching rules in the run-up to polling day. An investigation by the electoral commission has provisionally found that Vote Leave erted money to a smaller pro-Brexit group to bypass campaign finance caps. The commission’s report has yet to be published, but former Vote Leave executives have made the charge public, alongside their own rebuttal – a spoiler which will\u0026nbsplimit the impact when the full story breaks.Separately, senior figures at Leave.EU, a rival pro-Brexit campaign led by Nigel Farage, have been accused\u0026nbspof improper association with the Russian embassy and of misleading parliament about the connection. Earlier this year, Leave.EU was also fined £70,000 for spending-related breaches of electoral law.The Electoral Commission looks overwhelmed by the challenge of policing 21st century democracy. It can only uphold the law as it exists and, as it warns, those statutes are obsolescing in an age of global digital networks and big data. The norms of politics have changed, the flow of money is harder to track, making it harder to discern what constitutes a fair political fight. Ideally politicians would lead this debate, but there is a systemic problem: no winning side will ever want to start a conversation that casts doubt on the legitimacy of its victory.In the case of Brexit, the winning side has gone further, largely refusing to engage with any of the consequences of the choice it recommended. Vote Leave and Leave.EU sold their big idea on terms that others must now deliver. Theresa May tried last year to transfer the referendum mandate to herself by calling a general election. She lost her majority, but that result did not dent her conviction that the “will of the people” is whatever she asserts it to be. She abandoned most of her manifesto – but the Brexit element she holds sacrosanct.A gap has thus opened up between the verdict on Britain’s EU membership delivered one June day two years ago and the political process that would traditionally be accountable for taking such a momentous decision. Dissent on the question of Brexit is denigrated as an offence against the people and inevitably that attitude bleeds into a more generalised culture of governing arrogance. Habits of disregard for practical policy and a cavalier attitude to truth that were pioneered by the leave side in the EU referendum have proved contagious.One example: Esther McVey, work and pensions secretary, was today forced to apologise to parliament for misleading comments made about universal credit. Sir Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, had accused Mrs McVey of misrepresenting a report his agency had published criticising implementation of the flagship welfare reform. It was an unusually robust public rebuke, testifying to frustration with a politician who appears to have believed that the facts of the matter can be whatever she chooses them to be.It is easy to see how a minister in Mrs May’s cabinet might acquire that delusion. The ethos of this\u0026nbspgovernment has been corrupted by its relationship with the legacy of the leave campaign. That project now looks dishonest on many levels, while the mechanisms that might hold it to account look unequal to the task.It suits any government to decide that the popular will has been captured once and once only. That approach removes the frustrating obligation to consider that minds change, or that new facts come to light. But convenient though that might be for ministers, it isn’t how a healthy democracy works."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c4820ab61f162c3f8d4acafdb236ed3beac8c4b/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3b5afa0642784124b6dcfbdaff00ca7","title":"the guardian view on world heritage in the beginning was the dream","story":"Unesco has just added to its list of world heritage sites one of the most remarkable archaeological locations in the world, one which raises huge questions about the development of civilisation and offers no answers at all. Göbekli Tepe appears to be no more than a hill of dirt in the bare, brown landscape of south-eastern Turkey, but excavations starting in the 1990s revealed something extraordinary: beneath the surface were rings of megaliths, carved stones weighing up to 20 tonnes, which had been first placed there 11,000 years ago, before the invention of agriculture or the discovery of metal. No one seems actually to have lived on the site. This was, so far as we can tell, the first temple complex built anywhere on earth. It far predates cities. Its builders\u0026nbspknew how to plant stones and carve them, but not to plant crops for food. Yet somehow they must have\u0026nbsphad the social organisation to come together in groups larger than any hunter-gatherer band and coordinate their labours over months or years.What they believed, and why they did this, remains a mystery, and one which opens a profound question. Did cities make gods or did gods make cities? One theory holds that the development of elaborate religions and belief systems followed the development of complicated societies, in which agriculture provided a surplus of food. There were relatively large settlements in other parts of the Middle East at around that time, made possible by the immense fertility of the land before humans and their goats took it over. But no one seems to have lived at Göbekli Tepe. It was not built for any practical purpose. It must have been the expression of a great shared dream. In that sense, it was a city that the gods built, even if the gods existed only in the\u0026nbspminds of their worshippers and had no form that we could now recognise.One Australian researcher has suggested that the builders thought of the limestone they used as itself alive, and that the structures that they built with it represented a negotiation with the living, hungry rock. This is a way of thinking that is profoundly strange to us – but even if the explanation is entirely wrong, the structures of Göbekli Tepe must have emerged from some thought-world quite as alien, for\u0026nbspthey make no sense in ours.Göbekli Tepe is only one of more than a thousand of Unesco’s world heritage sites, which include both expressions of the human spirit in architecture, and areas of nature which stir us profoundly. Unesco has been attacked as a bloated bureaucracy, but it is also itself the expression of a noble dream: that there could be places and buildings so beautiful that they transcend nationality and even culture and speak in some way to the whole human race. They range from Malawi’s Chongoni rock art area all the way to the whole city of Venice. And their immense, incomprehensible ersity shows us that the human imagination is stranger – and stronger – than we can ever hope to understand."},{"url":null,"title":"university of reading twitter putdown refugee plan","story":"“You’ve won the internet,” one Twitter user congratulated the University of Reading after it dished up a hearty dose of social media sass. The “winning” tweet was a robust dismissal of critics of the university’s refugee scholarship scheme.“We’ve had feedback over the last week that some people are unhappy with our plan to offer up to 14 scholarships to refugees living in the local area. To these people, we would like to say: Tough. Jog on.” A similar message was posted on the university’s Facebook page.On the one hand, it’s great to see an academic institution that’s proud to support refugees, to act on its values and to express all of this with a bit of personality. The 68,000 likes, together with delighted responses on social media, show just how satisfying a snarky put-down can be if it’s issued by a member of your tribe.These kinds of righteous snubs are rife on social media. But while they can be satisfying if we agree with the sentiment, they don’t actually move anything forward. Stating that you are right and other people are wrong is not a strategy for change. In fact, there’s solid evidence to suggest that talking in this way can do damage: entrenching isions, compounding hostility and turning people away from your cause and position.Social media moments such as this don’t just stay in social media. They spill over into the news and the broader public discourse, where they shape attitudes and beliefs over time. While Twitter might feel like a playground for the quick-witted, deliberately provocative tweets like this one can have far-reaching effects.First, in calling out the opinions and beliefs it finds problematic, the University of Reading may well be further entrenching the very views it’s seeking to dismiss. Beliefs and ideas are like muscles – when an idea is invoked, it is flexed and strengthened, whether that is the intention or not.Second, by telling people they are wrong, the university is driving people further into their tribes, fuelling cultural isions and alienating anyone who doesn’t strongly support its stance. Most people aren’t firmly fixed in their attitudes towards refugees. In fact, most people have mixed feelings about most issues. Strident projections of moral superiority shine an unwelcome and uncomfortable light on this ideological indecision. They prompt anyone who’s undecided to back away to avoid feeling awkward and exposed. Our brains work hard to protect us from uncomfortable thoughts and feelings – and this cognitive immune system kicks in when we feel judged or unsure of our views.Public attitudes towards refugees and migrants matter. They can cultivate a fertile ground for compassionate policy making and inclusive behaviour, or they can legitimise hostile environments. Public attitudes in this space are also complicated. It is hard to influence public thinking in a meaningful way. Even the genuine public outcry over the government’s treatment of the Windrush migrants is unlikely to have shifted public thinking about immigration more broadly.Generally speaking, changing public thinking requires us to celebrate all that we share, not draw attention to the iding lines. We can learn a lot from the handling of recent polarised debates on marriage equality and abortion in the Republic of Ireland. Campaigners built on – and continue to build on – shared values and ideals. They speak to the moral shared ground instead of casting aspersions from the moral high ground. It’s not about stripping out the conviction or substance, or about dialling down passion. It’s about communicating in a way that is compassionate, inclusive and is actually effective.We don’t win the internet – or anything else – by stirring isions and telling people they are wrong. We don’t win with snarky put-downs from the moral high ground. If belittling tweets were the answer to our problems, the world might be in different shape. While the University of Reading might have earned itself a place in this week’s Twitter in-crowd, it is likely to be doing harm to the cause it aims to champion.• Nicky Hawkins is a communications strategist for the FrameWorks Institute"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcf8a09426028d717ce2754766c360df09b0ef96/0_0_650_392/master/650.jpg?w=940\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1bce8d78898daebc80f996d8c7e97aea 1880w","title":"hottest heatwaves books film music","story":"Tension simmers, passions rage and things are never the same again. We pick the books, film and music in which heatwaves inspire race riots, sexual abandon – and even a chainsaw massacre ‘I love England in a heatwave,” says a character in Ian McEwan’s novel Atonement. “It’s a different country. All the rules change.” And he’s not just referring to the sudden hike in the price of a 99 Flake. In works of art, the weather is a reliable indicator for internal turbulence, with the heatwave an especially pliable metaphor. It is called into service to signify everything from overwhelming passions to oppressive tensions, a ripening or a boiling-over. Not for nothing is an entire genre, the coming-of-age story, predicated on the idea that things were never the same again after that summer.The pinnacle is LP Hartley’s The Go-Between, the overarching influence on Atonement, in which the relentlessly beating sun is a transformative force: “In the heat, the commonest objects changed their nature. Walls, trees, the very ground one trod on, instead of being cool were warm to the touch: and the sense of touch is the most transfiguring of all the senses … In the heat the senses, the mind, the heart, the body, all told a different tale. One felt another person, one was another person.” It’s hard to stay cool in a heatwave, especially if you’re British and unaccustomed to its severity. Just ask Alice, whose adventures in Wonderland are precipitated by weather which makes her feel “very sleepy and stupid” and causes her to wonder “whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies.” Jean Rhys in her Jane Eyre prequel Wide Sargasso Sea describes “the time of day when though it is hot and blue and there are no clouds, the sky can have a very black look,” while McEwan has used heat to apply additional pressure to his characters, much as a sadistic schoolboy might pursue ants with a magnifying glass. The orphaned brood of The Cement Garden lose their innocence as the world rots in the sunshine (“Outside there was a cloud of flies round the overflowing dustbins … A packet of butter had melted into a pool … it was the hottest day since 1900”) while the doomed romance of Atonement unravels against a savage summer of “vast heat that rose above the house and park, and lay across the Home Counties like smoke, suffocating the farms and towns”. It encourages — or so the parents are inclined to believe — “loose morals amongst young people”. Wherever sunshine and British people mix, the result is likely to be fraught think of EM Forster dispatching his creations to Italy and to India, or of the film-maker Joanna Hogg sending the upper-class holidaymakers of her 2006 debut, Unrelated, off to Tuscany to be perfectly miserable. Here the heat and beauty serve as an effective counterpoint to whatever woes the characters are experiencing. Anna (Kathryn Worth) is tormented by a failing relationship, her yearning for a child and the callous flirtations of a man two decades her junior (played by a young, icicle-eyed Tom Hiddleston). The delicious scenery seems only to exacerbate her problems. There’s a similar dynamic at play in Chris Power’s recent short-story collection Mothers, where a series of far-flung idylls only point up the characters’ inner discomfort: Cadaqués becomes the backdrop for a cataclysmic decision, Rhodes the site of childhood trauma, Mexico City the burial ground for an irresolvable desire. Whatever the problem, the heat seems to both reflect and inflame it. Nowhere is this truer than in some of America’s sweatiest cinema. Would The Texas Chainsaw Massacre have been less scary or oppressive if it had been relocated, say, to Anchorage? The director Tobe Hooper littered the set with animal bones and carcasses, and somehow the stench that caused cast and crew members to throw up in the stifling heat seems to waft off the screen toward our nostrils. Perspiration drips off every face in Sidney Lumet’s scorching Dog Day Afternoon, with Al Pacino and John Cazale as touchingly ill-prepared criminals who choose the hottest day of the year to hold up a New York City bank. Lumet knew what he was doing putting the screws on by turning up the heat — he’d done the same thing in Twelve Angry Men, where it was only the suits and ties that distinguished the jury room from a sauna.Michael Douglas is just one angry man stalking Los Angeles in Falling Down, where it’s hard not to feel that a light shower might cure at least some of his ills then again, it never rains in southern California. Even if it did, would it help? “You’d think the rain would’ve cooled things down,” says Thelma Ritter in Hitchcock’s Rear Window, another thriller set in a heatwave. “All it did was make the heat wet.” In Do the Right Thing, as with In the Heat of the Night before it, the heatwave becomes a manifestation of the racial tensions at the heart of America. Brooklyn’s fire hydrants are up for grabs, while DJ Mr Señor Love Daddy (Samuel L Jackson) gives a comical running commentary on the escalating temperatures: “If you have a Jheri curl, stay in the house or you’ll end up with a permanent plastic helmet on your head forevah!” But the heat is no easier to quell than the conflicts stoked by a racist police force and a pigheaded Italian-American restaurateur. The only balm is experienced by the viewer, grateful to be watching from the cold comfort of an air-conditioned cinema. Spike Lee, the director of Do the Right Thing, returned to New York and heatwaves in Summer of Sam, which mingled the real-life hunt in 1977 for the serial killer known as Son of Sam, with the emergence of punk in America. The real summer of punk had taken place a year earlier in Britain, during the country’s own record-breaking heatwave (highs of more than 28C for 22 days, making it the hottest summer for three centuries), with Denis Howell, given ministerial responsibility for coping with drought, advising people to “take a bath with a friend” to conserve water. That same 1976 summer permeates Maggie O’Farrell’s novel Instructions for a Heatwave. Simmering family problems are manifested in the heat that “inhabits the house like a guest who has outstayed his welcome: it lies along corridors, it circles around curtains, it lolls heavily on sofas and chairs.” One thing the hot weather can do in art is to eliminate social isions. It’s an equaliser: if everyone’s in their bathing suits, as they are in Eric Rohmer’s Pauline at the Beach, then the normal social hierarchies dissolve. In François Ozon’s Swimming Pool, there can even be a kind of equality between a prissy British writer (Charlotte Rampling) and a promiscuous gadabout (Luine Sagnier). Though stripping off isn’t much help to Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) in The Talented Mr Ripley. “You’re so white,” says Dickie (Jude Law), Tom’s coveted social superior. “Grey, actually.” Summer heat can plunge the reader or viewer in an instant into an airless fug. Take the opening line of Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar: “It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn’t know what I was doing in New York.” But the air of melancholy hanging over the season is impossible to dispel because we know what lies around the corner. In two novels by Alan Hollinghurst, summer represents the last gasp of gay abandon before the decimating sweep of Aids: first in his 1988 debut The Swimming Pool Library, which takes place in “the last summer of its kind there was ever to be” and then in The Line of Beauty, the 2004 Booker prize winner, which picks up the thread in that same summer, 1983, and follows it into a more darkly troubled era. Even without the spectre of mortality, summer in art embodies a fleeting wistfulness, a carefree and uncontainable bliss. The Myth of the American Sleepover, the gorgeous 2012 debut film from David Robert Mitchell (who later made the chilling It Follows) is especially good on those seemingly endless juvenile summers when we clumsily forge our future selves like fumbling amateur blacksmiths. But if you want the mood of that movie distilled into seven minutes, it’s right there in David’s Last Summer, the final track (fittingly) from Pulp’s 1994 album His ’N’ Hers. Ash may have devoted a chunk of their career to turning lost summers into frenzied, bittersweet indie-pop (Bring Back the Summer, Buzzkill, Orpheus, Oh Yeah) while the Fall offered a pungent reality check on British People in Hot Weather (“Beached whale in Wapping  His armpit hairs are sprouting”). But it is Jarvis Cocker, picking his way through a daisy-chain of summery vignettes (“When we reached the stream I put a bottle of cider into the water to chill  Both of us knowing that we’d drink it long before it had the chance”), who captures most vividly the pull and the pain of summer, wending his way toward the lengthening shadows that signal autumn’s approach:And as we walked home we could hear the leaves curling and turningBrown on the trees,And the birds deciding where to go for winter.And the whole sound,The whole sound of summer packing its bags and preparing to leave town."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f10f48ef8380e2b5371adcbf9956c3a2a98d193/49_0_1475_885/master/1475.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eb00e654a54923786b1bcdb9c79e13d","title":"does the moon hold the key to the earths energy needs","story":"Tidal power is the only renewable source derived from the moon. Now an extraordinary array of devices promise to unlock this vital energy potentialUsing giant kites, blades and paddles, and mimicking pogo sticks, blowholes and even the human heart, groups around the world are on the cusp of harnessing the colossal power of the oceans.The challenge is huge - seas have been battering coasts and sweeping sailors to their doom for millennia - but so is the prize: huge amounts of clean, reliable and renewable electricity for an energy-hungry world. Taking on the challenge of operating in this savage, corrosive environment is not for the faint-hearted, and the costs remain worryingly high, as demonstrated by the government’s rejection on Monday of a £1.3bn tidal project at Swansea. “There is no doubt – shit happens during marine renewable energy projects,” says François Renelier at Bessé, a French insurance broker.But the ocean energy sector is frothing with ideas, with hundreds of companies developing an extraordinary array of devices and backed by billions of dollars of investment. Among the serious contenders tapping rapid tidal flows are 12 metre-wide underwater kites that soar and swoop.“We fly with the tides,” says Martin Eklund, at Minesto, which is installing a £25m array off Anglesey, north Wales. “The main advantage is we can harvest energy from very low currents. This resource is abundant – it is everywhere.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@the“We will need every kind of renewables we can get out hands on, including marine, to move us around, heat our homes and so on,” says Declan Meally, at the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.Many nations, from Ireland to India to Korea, are now making moves and tidal and wave energy capacity doubled in 2017, albeit from a very small base. China has invested $200m since 2010 in ocean energy, and the EU €3bn in combined public and private money in the last decade.Tidal energy is most advanced. Bladed turbines are being deployed, which harness fast tidal flows in the same way wind turbines catch the wind. The world’s first large-scale tidal array, the Meygen project built by Atlantis Resources in Orkney, is now sending power to the grid. But, unlike the wind industry which has settled on a three-blade design, underwater designers are also testing four and six-bladed versions too.OpenHydro, already deployed in Canada’s Bay of Fundy, use giant 16m hoops with inward-pointing blades that resemble the mouth of a giant lamprey fish. Its makers opened the world’s first tidal turbine manufacturing plant in Cherbourg last week. There are also vertical turbines that spin like a fairground carousel, such as Hydroquest in France and LHD in China, and one company is even making an undulating membrane inspired by swimming fish.Capturing wave power is even more challenging than tapping the tides – “survivability” is the key term in this sector. “The cost of building something to withstand these extremes is the only thing that has held it back so far,” says Tom Denniss of Wave Swell in Australia. His company’s device works like a blowhole, with waves blasting air up a tube and out through a turbine.He compares developing wave technology to his own record-breaking feat of endurance running: “I ran 622 marathons in 622 days and it was a lot easier than developing marine energy technology - at least it took less time.” Other wave devices, such as Wedge Global, use buoys that bounce up and down on a pole, like a pogo stick, then duck underwater when storms rolls in. Another, Corpower, uses a hydraulic system inspired by the human heart to dampen the impact of the worst weather. “That has been the big challenge for wave energy – how to turn it on and off in big storms,” says chief executive, Patrik Möller.Paddles are being deployed too, such as WaveRoller, which uses long seafloor flaps that are washed back and forth by swells. Another, Wave Piston, uses paddles strung along a 185m pipe to push pressurised water through a generator.The Wave Piston’s biggest challenge to date was a big industrial trawler ramming into the system, despite the deployment having been cleared with the marine authorities. “We have had a lot of adventures, some good, some bad,” says Martin von Bülow, at the company.One technology that is not being widely pursued is tidal lagoon power. Here, large, expensive walls are constructed to trap seawater at high tide, which is released through turbines at low tide. But those constructed so far, such as in France and Korea, took advantage of sea walls being built for other purposes such providing a transport link.Which technologies make it into mass production remains to be seen, but the sector is backed at the highest levels, from Europe to China to Canada. “Clean renewable energy from the sea ticks all the right boxes,” says Karmenu Vella, European Commissioner for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. “It is a groundbreaking industry with plenty of potential for new jobs and economic value, and in a world facing the devastating spectre of climate change, it also helps us supply homegrown energy while drastically cutting our greenhouse gas emissions,” he said at the International Conference on Ocean Energy in Cherbourg, France, last week.The way Denmark captured the wind turbine manufacturing market by moving early is inspiring many of the leading nations. “Everyone is trying to be the next Denmark, but for another technology,” says Bruce Cameron, the former director of renewable energy in Nova Scotia, which hosts the bay with the biggest tidal range in the world.However a major obstacle to ocean energy commercialisation has loomed into view: the stunning drop in cost of offshore wind power in the last year, as huge farms are rolled out. “While offshore wind in Europe has clearly come of age, ocean energy is still learning how to take the first steps,” says EU environment commissioner, Karmenu Vella.This has led some governments, such as the UK, directing their subsidy support to marine windfarms. This has left wave and tidal energy developers stranded between successful testing and the full-scale production that would then start driving costs down. “They call it the valley of death - we’re there,” says Marcelle Askew, at Swedish wave energy firm Seabased.However, some nations are still offering support: Canada has a feed-in-tariff and France, despite concerns at the finance ministry over costs, is expected to offer a major tender within months.Ocean energy supporters say it is essential in addition to offshore wind to drive progress towards a zero-carbon world. Tidal energy in particular has the advantage of being precisely predictable, years ahead. “As long as the moon circles around the Earth, you will always have tidal energy. But you can have no wind for days and days,” says Laurent Schneider-Maunoury, CEO of Naval Energies, the makers of OpenHydro.His company is also exploring another ocean energy technology which provides power 247, by exploiting the temperature difference between surface and deep waters to generate electricity. Like other ocean energy technologies, this may well already be competitive with the expensive diesel generators used in many small or isolated communities. Cost is not the only challenge to be overcome, such as ensuring coastal communities themselves benefit from projects and ensuring marine life is not endangered, though dolphins, seals and fish all appear to avoid the devices deployed so far.The big question remains undecided: will ocean energy will provide a major new wave of renewables in the years to come? Some have doubts, like Prof AbuBakr Bahaj, at Southampton University in the UK, and who has analysed the sector for 25 years. “I’m not really sure,” he says.Others, like Drew Blaxland, from developers Atlantis, says with many technologies now proven to work, it is simply time to scale up production and drive down the costs. His message is blunt: “Wake the hell up, grab it by the nuts and get on with it.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

He is a good player, very fast, who likes to cut inside. We must do not do anything stupid with him inside the box.”Sweden are the underdogs for the game in Samara but there is the feeling within the squad that the tag will suit them. The winger Viktor Claesson believes that the pressure will be on England. “They will expect to beat us and be expected to beat us,” Claesson said. “But we are going to make it difficult for them.”The captain, Andreas Granqvist, had a warning for England’s fans. “I read something about people in England suggesting that Sweden were a dream opponent,” he said. “Someone said something about 99 times out of 100 they would beat us? Well, it’s fun for England to have that sort of confidence. Let’s play the game and see how things go. Sweden usually play well against England. We’ve had good results against them.”The last time that the nations met was in a friendly in 2012 when Sweden won 4-2, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic scoring all four goals, including an outrageous kung-fu-style kick from long range. Ibrahimovic retired from international football after Euro 2016 and he is not at the World Cup but, at times, it can feel as though he is.Ibrahimovic’s status is so heavyweight that he remains a talking point and he made headline-grabbing comments about the Sweden team after the second round of group stage ties. “I felt I can do it much better than them, obviously – and I still feel that,” Ibrahimovic said.Victor Lindelof says that he will be “about 95” by the time people stop asking him about Ibrahimovic and none of the players have been able to dodge questions on him.But Andersson’s squad have moved on from their long-time talisman and, in the absence of him and other any glamour name, the manager has placed the emphasis on the collective. The results have followed. Sweden finished on top of Group F, ahead of Mexico and Germany, before beating Switzerland in the last 16. Their compact style and unquenchable spirit have made them tough opponents.“We are a nation to be taken seriously,” Lindelof said. “It’s difficult to play against us because we defend very well and it’s hard to find spaces between the lines. We defend very well – with all 11 players on the pitch.”There has been a clamour in some quarters to anoint the attacking midfielder Emil Forsberg as the creative heir to Ibrahimovic but nobody inside the camp seems to like the comparison.“Ibrahimovic is the best player we had in Sweden and it’s difficult to\u0026nbspcompare players with him,” Lindelof said. “But Emil is a fantastic player and\u0026nbsphe deserves all the good things in\u0026nbsplife. I haven’t spoken to Ibrahimovic\u0026nbspabout what he has said about the team. How old will I be when\u0026nbsppeople stop asking me about him? About 95.”Claesson added: “It was a long time ago that Ibrahimovic retired. We don’t pay attention to that talk. I didn’t even play in that team so for me it doesn’t matter. He can just keep on talking but I think he will be happy for us now. Am I frustrated to keep being asked about him? Yes! It’s better to focus on the players who did a great job here.”It was put to Claesson that, whereas the Sweden set-up used to revolve around one man, it was now about the team, “Yes,” he replied. “It’s perfect for us and for Sweden, the country. I think we like this. We are underdogs and a team together. It’s perfect.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/237ad4f62c00aab0641f9881f756d4d97351008d/81_377_7104_4262/master/7104.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c61dec7b51a44358b59e5ce6fe680150","title":"england fans look to enjoy world cup good times while they last","story":"Anticipation before Saturday’s game against Sweden has begun to tip into deliriumSince England dramatically beat Colombia on penalties in the Spartak stadium, Carl Gould’s phone has not stopped buzzing: his wedding reception is due to begin at exactly the same moment England kick off against Sweden for their crunch World Cup quarter final and guests are understandably worried.“I have received a lot of texts asking if there’s going to be a television at the reception,” he says, “The answer is, no, there isn’t. We’re not getting married in a Wetherspoons.”Gould convincingly insists that his mind will be completely focused on his bride, Katie, but as someone who remembers the agonies of Euro 96 he is hoping the pair’s nuptials may bring the team luck. “I’ve lived through the England experience,” he says. “So I’m just hoping for the best. If we could have a wedding win, and a England win – that would be ideal.”It is the outcome an entire nation is feverishly praying for. Less than 24 hours after Gareth Southgate’s young team became the first England side to ever win a World Cup penalty shootout, anticipation ahead of the game against Sweden has already begun to tip into delirium.From suggestions that the new Heathrow terminal should be named after the England manager, to early hoarding of barbecue supplies, a nation that has known significantly more than 30 years of hurt is determined to enjoy this moment in the unexpected sunshine.“If the last eight years have taught us anything it is to enjoy the good times while they last,” says Mark Perryman, author of 1966 and Not All That. “There is that sense that people are going overboard – we beat Colombia on penalties, we’ve lost to Belgium. But with everything else that is going in the world, you have to enjoy it. We all just want it so much, don’t we.”But within seconds of Jordan Pickford’s save and Eric Dier’s winning penalty, scenes of mass jubilation and relief exploded in bars and clubs, living rooms and town squares. Chants of “It’s coming home” – a song with more resilience than a particularly hardy cockroach – echoed through the land and repeated, like ticker tape for several hours on thousands of different Twitter feeds.It would only be slightly overblown to describe it as a powerfully shared public experience of redemption, says John Williams, associate professor in sociology at Leicester university. “We witnessed manifestation of the national anxiety about who we are and what we can do,” he says. “This was a young team – and they came through. It’s a great kind of assertion of our national capabilities through sport.”For a country torn apart by a isive EU referendum vote, the collective release brought by a decent run at the World Cup has been heightened, he adds.“We are at a moment in our country’s history where we are uncertain about who we are, how we fit in to the rest of the world,” he says. “I think we’d like to say that the victory over Colombia says something about who we are as a people – we are facing an uncertain future and perhaps we hope we can deal with it in the same way that those young men did in Moscow.”The redemption of one man in particular has captured the nation’s imagination. The narrative arc that saw the agony of Southgate’s penalty miss in Euro 96 erased by England’s first ever World Cup victory on penalties in Moscow has created an unprecedented outpouring among already emotional fragile fans. “Southgate has just proved what it is to understand past mistakes so well you turn them into future victory. It’s the stuff of proper mythology,” declared broadcaster Emily Maitlis.Tweeting a picture of Southgate embrace of Colombia’s Mateus Uribe in the wake of his crucial penalty miss against England, singer and England fan Alistair Griffin quoted If, by Rudyard Kipling:But while long-suffering England fans can be forgiven for allowing themselves to enjoy the positivity sweeping the country, it is tinged with an anxiety of what is still to come, says Felicia Pennant, editor-in-chief of fashion and football zine Season. “It was an amazing achievement, but it wasn’t a perfect performance – and we are going to have to play better if we are really going to progress,” she says.And yet, with the delusion of a true England fan, she has faith that Southgate’s team can shake of the baggage of past tournaments and go all the way to the final. “We are chasing history,” she says. “I’m hoping for a new English standard – one were we play well, and just win in normal time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af7821f1f8aef117f551cf4344c66ad9c3f15599/0_120_4570_2742/master/4570.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de73ba40010a5f1974b4c5ecc7a5defb","title":"england sweden reality check harry kane quarter final","story":"Well, that was fun. After two hours of vivid, gruelling knockout football at the Spartak Stadium, England’s penalty shootout defeat of Colombia felt at times like an overload of the senses. A quarter-final with Sweden in Samara awaits on Saturday.England have finally won on penalties, led by the man who previously lost on penalties. And while football may not be coming home just yet, it is certainly loosening up, making friendly overtures, liking your social media posts and generally seeming a lot more fun than the rather cold and distant tournament summers of the last decade.There is an issue of balance here. On Wednesday morning the ’s Hadley Freeman tweeted that an American friend had compared the endearing optimism of England fans to “one of those crazy people who goes on a good date and immediately starts planning the wedding”.But then in its role as the most important of all the unimportant things sport exists to create these moments, to hit the big, fat, wet emotional high note, to tell the kind of stories football likes to tell about itself. Whatever happens from here, we will always have Moscow and a night of agreeably loopy sporting catharsis.Plus this was unarguable progress. José Pekerman’s Colombia were always likely to provide England’s best XI with a more layered test than Tunisia and the Sunday seconds of Panama. Beneath the veneer of well-run details this England team has felt at times a bit like an expert branding exercise. The more they talked about systems and DNA, the more they seemed to have a system and some DNA. The more they were said to be mature, studious and likeable the more they seemed to be mature and studious and likeable.But were they any good? In Moscow England were stretched and bruised in new ways. For periods in the second half the Colombian players were drawn to the referee the way the best Barcelona teams are drawn to the ball, surrounding him, intercepting him, everyone wanting a touch. Perhaps it’s time to create a new stat for times such as these: touches of the ref’s arm, words in his ear, imaginary cards brandished (successful and unsuccessful).After England’s penalty was awarded Colombia’s players waved their arms and stamped around in a group on top of the penalty spot for two long minutes. Harry Kane stepped back, re-spotted it. Waited a bit. Floated his kick down the middle. This was super-ballsy stuff, Kane as leader, as a big player, as the daddy in this team. Yes, this was big daddy Kane.Overall Southgate’s team were neither too nice or too nasty. Instead they offered a reflection of the manager’s best qualities, an agreeably cold-blooded kind of stubbornness. On the other hand this was also a 1-1 draw against a depleted Colombia.To really take their World Cup deep England will have to beat a top-level opponent at some stage. Delight in their progress will not disguise the fact there are improvements required, areas in which England have been below their best and strengths that other teams will now prepare for.And so on to the bad news. England have scored one goal, a penalty kick, in their last four hours of World Cup football. Winning a shootout feels good. But it is rarely a sign that all is well. Since France 98 just two of 14 teams to progress on penalties have gone on to win their next game.Southgate will know all of this. He will also be keen to re-cast a little what has been a notably fixed-gear style in attack. Here’s a good stat. Kane has had six shots on target at Russia 2018. All six have ended in the net. Include off-target efforts and Kane’s tally rises to a paltry nine. This is winning football pared down to a state of absolute minimalism.Pep Guardiola drew a little heat last season by calling Spurs “the Harry Kane team”, but England are in effect the Harry Kane Nation, their captain not just the best No 9, but the best No 10 too, best crosser, best passer near goal and one really consistent hope of registering in the goals column.Only Belgium have scored more times than England. Only Russia have run further. No other team still in at Russia 2018 has lost the ball fewer times in their own half. But Belgium, Brazil, Uruguay and Sweden have all had more shots, while England have had only three efforts at goal from the left side of the pitch all tournament, compared to 16 for Belgium and 14 for Brazil. Get this too: England have had just one shot on target from outside the area in open play, joint last with Australia.The numbers confirm what the eye can see. Passing carefully, running a lot, being cute at set pieces and trusting in Harry have been enough so far. England have got to the last eight driving a car with three wheels. Why should they do things differently now?The answer lies in the fact they will be required at some stage to beat a high-functioning team. To do so they will need more in particular from the attacking midfield trio.Raheem Sterling, Jesse Lingard and Dele Alli moved well and defended with skill against Colombia. Sterling often found the right spaces, just not necessarily at the right time. Early on he troubled Yerry Mina so often he ended up with Mina piggybacking around in a circle on his shoulders, like a friendly, sleepy bear being carried off to bed.But Brazil, France, Belgium and Croatia all have greater verve in these midfield areas, with more successful dribbles and runs into the penalty area so far. Alli has had one shot at goal. Sterling has one, Lingard two. An improvement will surely be key against the better teams, as will choosing just the right moment to make a forward run alongside or beyond the lone spearhead.England have nothing to lose now, no promises to keep, no demons to slay. They are in credit, a team flying above the clouds. The challenge is simply to find some extra gears, a greater collectivism in attack to match the defensive will. The opportunity is there to take a more nuanced, more layered fight to Sweden in the heat of Samara this weekend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/696ec8fe328380f22fcae6e05047c6bdf4cccb67/0_131_3261_1956/master/3261.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccdd03c973261083ab8f414d479fe699","title":"harry kane england sweden jamie vardy fit","story":"Gareth Southgate’s fears over the fitness of Harry Kane have been allayed in the aftermath of his team’s bruising knockout success over Colombia and the England captain is set to lead the side into Saturday’s World Cup quarter-final against Sweden.Kane, the tournament’s leading scorer with six goals from three appearances, had experienced discomfort in his calf after the game. But he has since declared himself fit after undergoing a massage to relieve cramp.There are more serious concerns over Jamie Vardy, however. The Leicester forward required a sugar injection in his groin immediately after the match at the Spartak Stadium.The substitute, who came off the bench towards the end of normal time, had felt the twinge five minutes into extra time but still lasted to the final whistle however, Southgate resisted the temptation to ask the 32-year-old to take a penalty while carrying the injury. The manager has made clear that all those taking spot-kicks must be fully fitand comfortable to strike the ball cleanly. Vardy, who scored six penalties at club level last season, relinquished his position among the five nominated pre-match for the shootout.Ashley Young suffered knocks to his ankle and thigh in the fractious contest with Colombia, though the Manchester United wing-back has been encouraged that the muscular problem has not stiffened up since returning to Repino.Dele Alli is understood to be fit after his recent thigh injury, reporting no issues after the game, while Kyle Walker has shaken off the cramp that affected him in extra time and attended a team meeting called by Southgate in the gym at the team’s base at lunchtime on Wednesday.Only eight players, including the goalkeepers Jack Butland and Nick Pope, and Marcus Rashford of those who had featured against Colombia, later trained in the pouring rain at Zelenogorsk after the team returned to their hotel at 6.30am after the game in Moscow.They enjoyed a light session, with Southgate and the attacking coach Allan Russell making up the numbers. Options will be bolstered by the return of Fabian Delph after the Manchester City midfielder flew back to Russia having been at his wife’s side at the birth of their daughter on Wednesday morning.“Watching my brothers come through a tough game both mentally and physically, I kicked every ball and felt every bit of emotion with the players, staff and fans,” posted Delph on social media, alongside a photograph of him on a private jet bound for St Petersburg.“At 07:52, me, my wife and two beautiful daughters welcomed their baby sister into the world.

If his apparently supreme confidence seems slightly at odds with assorted accounts of the England and Everton goalkeeper as a quiet, almost shy, teenager it may stem partly from loan stints in the tough-as-teak non-league habitats of Darlington and Alfreton.It did not take Pickford long to work out that self-assurance would constitute an essential element in his armoury as he ventured out from Sunderland’s academy and strove to survive in a new, rough-around-the-edges “men’s world”. As the 24-year-old puts it: “I learned quite a lot from getting battered by fully grown blokes.”Wayne Bradley, Alfreton’s chairman, retains happy memories of Pickford’s five clean sheets in 12 appearances during a loan spent covering for the injured Phil Barnes in 2013. Bradley was quickly struck by the contrast between the well-behaved teenager he met off the pitch and the formidable penalty area controller performing on it . “Jordan was a good lad,” he says. “He kept himself to himself and was a little shy. But when he crossed that white line it was all so different. He was so focused and so commanding. He was a class act.”Alfreton, then in the Conference, represented the second stage of a loan tour which began at Darlington and would steadily transport Pickford up the League pyramid as he variously stopped off at Burton, Carlisle, Bradford and Preston.After entering Sunderland’s youth system aged eight he progressed smoothly through the Wearside ranks until, in January 2012, he was judged ready for a taste of life at “Darlo”, where he started 17 games for what was then a seriously struggling Conference side.Craig Liddle, Darlington’s manager, was operating under an acute threat of liquidation and a transfer ban but succeeded in obtaining special dispensation to recruit an emergency goalkeeper.Options were limited but Liddle, now in charge of Middlesbrough’s academy, had a hunch he was making an inspired signing. “Darlington were under a transfer embargo, so we were only able to sign under-19s,” he recalls. “Without the embargo, I’d probably have gone for a more experienced keeper but I’d coached Jordan when I’d helped with Sunderland’s under-12s and, even at such a young age, it was clear he was a really special talent.“Jordan was 17 when he came to Darlington and you worry about throwing a young kid like that in. But he fitted in well straightaway. He made his debut in front of about 7,000 people against Fleetwood. We lost 1-0 but, after about 10 minutes, Jordan piled through a crowd of players to catch a corner. I thought: ‘You’ll do for me.’”Not that it was an easy posting. With Darlington in administration and seemingly super-glued to the relegation zone, Pickford conceded 11 goals in his first five games. “Jordan made mistakes but you expect that,” says Liddle. “The most impressive thing was the way in which he didn’t let the odd mistake bother him. In addition he wasn’t afraid to give lads almost twice his age an earful if he thought they were doing something wrong. He’d be yelling at the defenders playing in front of him he certainly wasn’t frightened of them.”Which is not to say his undeniable touch of arrogance was, or is, unhealthy. Pickford’s old friends at Sunderland speak of a character who, as if at the flick of a switch, morphs from ferociously competitive, sometimes downright moody goalkeeper to immensely likable, feet-on-the-ground north-easterner complete with a well-honed sense of humour.“Jordan was always really, impressively, confident but, above all else, he was also a lovely, down-to-earth lad and he’s still the same character today,” says Liddle. “He hasn’t changed a bit.”The three-month sojourn with Alfreton proved every bit as formative as those Darlington days. Indeed the no-nonsense reputation of the Midland club’s manager, Nicky Law, represented part of the reason Martin O’Neill, Sunderland’s manager, proved amenable to their request to borrow Pickford.“Sunderland sent me Jordan because they knew he’d be tested,” said Law, Burnley’s head of youth recruitment. “They knew that with me young players didn’t have their bellies tickled, that they’d be told the truth.“Jordan was different, though. He was raw but you could tell he ‘had it’. Not only special ability but the right mental attitude. A lot of youngsters are mentally frail. They think it’s all about wearing the right boots. But Jordan had a great attitude. Nothing fazed him.”Alfreton were so impressed they attempted to buy him from Sunderland. “We tried to sign him when his loan ended but we didn’t quite make it happen,” says Bradley. “You can only wonder what might have been if we’d managed to get a deal done.“To think he’s gone from Alfreton to playing in the World Cup as England’s No 1 inside five years is incredible. It’s a credit to him but also to our club. We’re proud to have played a part in his progress.“We never thought we’d see the day when a former Alfreton player would walk out as England’s first choice. We’re delighted for Jordan. We wish him all the luck in the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/876e1c4d76bbdcb4783a5e31c0df39e29e048c90/0_210_3776_2265/master/3776.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b8b71c5374fb01818d2cf3ee734fed7","title":"mark geiger bias allegations colombia england radamel falcao world cup","story":"The Colombia striker Radamel Falcao says referee Mark Geiger favoured England during the teams’ World Cup last-16 tie on Tuesday, while Argentina’s former striker Diego Maradona called the result a “monumental robbery”.England won after a penalty shootout and Falcao says decisions went against his team throughout the match. “The referee disturbed us a lot, in the 50-50 plays, he always made the calls in favour of England,” Falcao said. “This situation was undermining us. He didn’t act with the same criteria for both teams. When in doubt, he always went to the England side. It’s shameful that this happens in the round of 16 of a World Cup.”Six of the eight players booked during an ill-tempered game were Colombian, and Geiger also awarded England a penalty after Harry Kane was wrestled to the ground at a corner. Falcao believes Geiger’s nationality affected his decisions. “I found it peculiar that they put an American referee in this instance,” he said. “To tell you the truth, the process leaves a lot of doubts. He only spoke English, some bias was certain.”Maradona said England perpetrated a “monumental robbery” and said the American official should have penalised Kane rather than award a penalty. “Today I saw a monumental robbery on the pitch … a fatal mistake for a whole country,” he said of the incident that put England 1-0 ahead in the second half. “Here’s a gentleman who decides, a referee who, if you Google him, shouldn’t be given a match of this magnitude ... Geiger, an American, what a coincidence,” Maradona added on his nightly World Cup show for Venezuela-based Telesur broadcaster.Colombia players showed their displeasure with Geiger throughout the match, and they argued with the referee for several minutes after England were awarded their penalty in the second half. One player who did not seem as hostile to Geiger was Wilmar Barrios. The midfielder lifted his head into Jordan Henderson’s jaw during the first half but escaped with a booking rather than a red card. Barrios shook hands with the officials as he walked off at half-time.Of the 36 fouls called in the game, 23 went against Colombia. Their coach, Jose Pekerman, believes England were just as guilty as Colombia. “We shouldn’t only look at Colombian players, people should look at England players,” he said. “I wish I was wrong, but I think from the next match England will be much more careful. Today we were on the receiving end of this but I hope it won’t happen again. It’s been absolutely obvious, too obvious.”Fifa later dismissed Amrabat’s allegations. “Fifa referees are under clear instructions with regard to their behaviour and relationship with the teams at the 2018 Fifa World Cup Russia and it can be confirmed that Mr Geiger has acted in an exemplary and professional manner as an appointed match official,” it said in a statement.Geiger also refereed Colombia’s 3-0 victory over Greece at the 2014 World Cup.

The heat has a way of stunting your appetite, but not eating can make dealing with the heat physically that much more taxing. While consuming your bodyweight in ice-cream – the only edible equivalent of a e into the cold, cold sea – might feel sensible, science and India will tell you that a hot drink is what you need most. And when rail lines are threatening to buckle, using heat of any kind to cook a meal – or just boil the kettle – feels daft. We asked chefs from around the country for their tips on what to eat during a heatwave.A chilled beetroot soup is light, vibrant and quick: sweat red onions and red cabbage until soft then add in raw beetroot, diced very small – to ensure quick cooking – then cook until soft (about five minutes). Cover with boiling water, then cool before blitzing in a blender, with a good dollop of soured cream. Chill until cold, season to taste with salt and lime juice and top with chopped chives and more soured cream to serve.Quick-fry sliced garlic in olive oil, then turn off the heat and add finely chopped tomatoes and leave for 30 seconds. Stir in a handful of basil, roughly chopped, and season to taste. Toss through the pasta of your choice, finish with a drizzle of olive oil and – if you can face making them – a scattering of breadcrumbs.My go-to is a salad of fridge-cold green leaves – little gem is a good choice – torn into biggish pieces, fresh peas, broad beans and radishes, with a dressing of fridge-cold buttermilk (or, in a pinch, yoghurt), which naturally has such a cooling flavour, seasoned with salt, pepper and lime or lemon juice. Served with sourdough bread and a glass of rosé. Light, fresh, cooling.Take a ripe pineapple – it must be ripe – and peel it, then place it in the freezer overnight. The next day, grate it, and you get an instant granita. Delicious with some chopped fresh mint or basil folded through it. Serve in a tall Sunday glass with creme fraiche, some finely sliced fresh pineapple, a few sprigs of fresh mint and a sprinkling of palm sugar. Spicy food cools you down by raising your core temperature and making you sweat: it causes your body to self-regulate. So, I’d opt for a Thai-style som tam salad: mix green mango and papaya, shredded, with lots of fresh coriander and peanuts. Dress with palm sugar, lots of red chilli, garlic, tomato and lots of lime juice, pounded together in a pestle and mortar to balance out the hot, sour, sweet and salty flavours.When it’s hot, we need more liquid and less alcohol, so a good, easy cocktail is something fortified – sherry, port, vermouth, Campari, martini – on the rocks, topped up with tonic water, soda, lemonade or a mix of all three, garnished with whatever you have to hand – a slice of orange or lemon, a sprig of mint or rosemary. For something very low-alcohol, tonic water with angostura bitters is great – the alcoholic content is minimal because you only need a few drops.Whizz up some almonds in blender – either blanched or ground – to obtain a paste, then very slowly add water to get a smooth soup. Season with sherry vinegar, a little crushed garlic, a little olive oil and some salt. Ladle into bowls and top with fresh fruit – cherries, grapes or, my favourite, really cold sweet melon. Drizzle with olive oil to serve. It is vegan and beautifully cooling.Fresh, raw, good-quality veg, which is bountiful in farmers’ markets right now, keeps well at room temperature: try tomatoes, spring onions, shaved artichokes, green beans and lightly blanched broad beans with loads of fresh herbs, dressed half an hour before you eat with olive oil, salt, lemon juice and zest or, if tomatoes, some chardonnay vinegar. Very little prep, which means more time outdoors.Pan-fried dover sole – or blonde ray, an excellent alternative to skate – is delicious at this time of year. And the beauty of cooking fish in the heat is that it is so quick: 4 minutes on either side and you’re sorted. Fry it on the bone so it retains its moisture then flake and stir through a fresh garden-pea salad, with some finely sliced raw shallots, fresh goats cheese, olive oil, salt and pepper. Add in some finely sliced red chilli to spice it up a bit if you like, and a little crispy bacon, or cured ham.You don’t need as much sustenance in the heat as you do in the cold, so fresh, green things are best – they’re satisfying, but also keep you feeling awake and light. And the most cooling veg is kohlrabi. Find a small one (red or white), peel it and slice very thinly. Lay out on a plate and dress with olive oil and lemon juice, then dot with fresh ricotta or – my favourite – sprouted puy lentils. And to drink, place sprigs of lemon verbena in a jug of ice-water. Beats lemon slices and cucumber hands down.The crucible of Indian eating is the constant heatwave – even in the winter, it’s hot. So, much of the food we make is geared towards cooling. One of the things my mother and grandmother always made me is lassi. Make the base mixing one part low-fat yoghurt with one part soy milk. Flavour with rose water, crushed green cardamom pods and pomegranate juice and season with a pinch of salt and some sugar, which realigns your electrolytes.Salad is an obvious choice, as is cured meat – both stand up well in the heat. In Italy, prosciutto is given to hospital patients: it’s very nutritious and highly digestible, which is also key when it’s very hot. If you are going to cook, it needs to be something very quick. I like to cook whole courgettes – the small, thin ones – very quickly in boiling water, with a little salt, for two minutes, then drain them and leave them to cool, before slicing them lengthways.

Like an old-fashioned game of Would You Rather, your answer is a signifier, the same as cats or dogs (dogs) and Whitney or Mariah (Whitney). Still or sparkling? Always sparkling.Fizzy water inspires zealotry. But few things sound more tame, or suggest that I’m definitely past my Saturn Return, than being #obsessed with seltzer. Cue La Croix, the sugar-free, flavoured sparkling water that has bubbled its way into the lives of, well, seemingly all Americans in the past three years. Among millennials, it is little short of a religion.I can see why. From its lurid Miami-Vice-meets-Fat-Willy’s branding to the multicoloured cans, each delineating one of its 21 flavours (including coconut, peach-pear and passionfruit), La Croix is a siren of a beverage to look at – and that’s before you taste it. I first tried it on a trip to LA, where a friend had just been through a dramatic breakup that revolved around a pair of La Croix branded socks. I’ll admit I was dubious about it – flavoured waters had always grossed me out (I’m looking at you, Volvic Touch of Fruit) – but the sock story was intriguing and I needed to know more.It had me at the grapefruit – or “naturally pamplemousse-essenced” (despite this quasi-French vibe, it is pronounced without the “X” – “Croy”, as in Croydon). I was hooked. On first sip, I found the happy spritz of fizzy water with the added dimension of a fruity flavour, but not – and this is important – the sweetness of pops and sodas. In the wake of sugar taxes and countless clean-living social media feeds, La Croix has stepped in as a viable alternative to Fanta et al, not to mention booze, without being “just water”. It’s gaudy yet wholesome, moreish but good for you– “methadone for the soda addict”, as one journalist put it. Everyone’s a winner.Despite its stratospheric rise to prominence, La Croix is not new. It started in Wisconsin in 1981 and for a long time was just-another-water-brand, beloved of midwestern soccer moms. In 2015, it became a breakout hit, quickly becoming the darling of coastal creatives, celebrities and Instagram. Plaudits came in the form of an independent clothing line, La Croixs Over Boys a skit between Miley Cyrus and Jimmy Fallon on the Tonight Show, and many songs by – usually male – fans taking ownership of their favourite beverage. “When you’re sippin’ on La Croix  You know it brings you joy,” sings YouTuber Rakeem. Yes, yes it does.It has not been without its controversies either, and just this week CEO of La Croix parent company National Beverage Nick Caporella has been accused of sexual harassment (allegations which he denies). The water isn’t available in the UK, but if you don’t mind flavours such as cucumber – which somehow don’t seem nearly trashy-fun enough – fizzy water brands such as Dash make good alternatives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eafa44176bd7c30910bc46d943163caa8873ef0/32_61_3934_2360/master/3934.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d71f82eab27b8020de080a6bc61471cc","title":"bbc teen viewers box sets iplayer netflix","story":"New teen section of iPlayer will target younger viewers who currently favour NetflixThe BBC is stepping up its rivalry with Netflix and YouTube to win back teenage audiences by making box sets of bingeable “rite of passage” shows covering subjects such as sex education, cars and alcohol for a new teen section of BBC iPlayer.The new programmes – two of which will be presented by YouTube vloggers – will be available on a new section on BBC iPlayer and – unlike other shows on the platform, which can only be accessed for up to 30 days – will remain there for up to five years.With the corporation recently revealing that more younger viewers are watching Netflix than all of its TV services, BBC Children’s head of content, Cheryl Taylor, said the proliferation of new platforms highlighted the gap in the choice of programmes available for those too old for children’s channels CBeebies and CBBC and too young for BBC3, which is aimed at 16- to 34-year-olds. “You don’t see ordinary teens that much on the BBC or shows about those kind of coming-of-age, sensitive subjects, which are key at a really important time in children’s lives … it’s important we remain relevant to all children,” said Taylor.The BBC has traditionally been deterred from airing more grown-up programmes on CBBC – which is for 6- to 12-year-olds – and on iPlayer because, Taylor said, “we don’t want to upset children and show them inappropriate content”. Other highlights range from summer-camp drama The A List, to Teen Taxi – a sort of Gogglebox meets Car Share real-life series that “will shine a humorous and engaging light on the conversations had between teenagers and their parents as they travel in their family cars”. Also on offer is a “junior Panorama”-style documentary series covering subjects such as teenagers emerging from foster care, boys becoming men, and life in eco-communities. CBBC doctors Chris and Xand van Tulleken will front special programmes on mental health and alcohol. Taylor said the YouTubers were chosen because they were already role models who influence children, but both she and BBC Children’s head of discovery, Stuart Rowson, said they hoped the BBC would grow its own influencers of the future. It is vital for the BBC’s future to bridge the gap for teenagers to stop them deserting the corporation as they are the licence fee payers of the future. Tony Hall, the director general, recently said that with the rise in power of US tech giants such as Facebook, Amazon and Netflix, the BBC had “a fight on our hands … a fight for the future of not just the BBC, but public service broadcasting in Britain”.Hall said the corporation risked being overtaken by competitors after finding that 16- to 24-year-olds spent more time with Netflix in a week than with all of BBC TV including the BBC iPlayer. Rowson said: “We need to react to the way young audiences are consuming content. This will give them bespoke content they can access on iPlayer, which has traditionally been a catchup service but is now working to become a video-on-demand service that we hope teenagers will go to as their default destination.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then.

This is the best bit of covering sport. I’ve been going to tournaments for the  since 2008, and looking back I’m still amazed at the sheer amount of hard work and the sheer volume of content produced around these occasions. From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted. At the end of which comes the daily web presence and the pristine design and set of the paper itself. All of this arrives with you updated to the second, cobbled together from the corners of some sock-stinking press room, polished by endlessly patient whip-smart subs and made to look lovely by some sleep-deprived awkward genius of a layout designer. It’s no secret our industry is looking to find ways of continuing to do all this. The old way of selling bits of paper doesn’t seem to work. Advertising is a capricious business.

Theresa May’s authority diminishes by the day. Her cabinet is barely speaking to one another and body bags have been ordered in for Friday’s Chequers mini-break. Esther McVey has been accused of deliberately misleading parliament about Universal Credit by the National Audit Office. Vote Leave has been accused of breaking the electoral rules on campaign spending. And Jeremy Corbyn is asking questions about buses. Six of them. You wait for one question about buses…Not that there is anything intrinsically wrong with using prime minister’s questions to wrong-foot May over buses. A large number of people depend on public transport to get around and bus services have become increasingly unreliable in many areas. Maybe, though, just one or two questions would have been enough. Then move on to trains, if you like. Chris Grayling’s job is hanging by a thread over his mishandling of the railways. But once you’ve done all that, just don’t forget to mention the war.As a general rule of thumb, a leader of the opposition is best off asking the questions a prime minister least wants to answer. And May is very happy not answering questions about buses. She doesn’t know anything about buses and she doesn’t care about buses because none of her MPs are giving her a hard time about buses. Tory voters, by and large, travel by car.The first question about buses received an answer about the NHS. May was only trying to be helpful. She didn’t have anything to say about buses but she knew she had to say something and she hoped the NHS would do. It wouldn’t. Corbyn pressed her again. The prime minister shrugged. She hadn’t a clue about local bus services in Cornwall. Were they the ones with £350m pasted on the side?Corbyn then went for a quick-fire round. The number 38 service in Greater Manchester. How many buses an hour? Pass. How many people had died because they couldn’t get to hospital? Pass. By the end, May looked positively cheerful. She’d come to PMQs expecting to be given a hard time. Public services falling apart were a breeze compared to the government falling apart.It took Owen Paterson, one of the hardline Brexiters in her own party, to ask the question she really didn’t want to answer. Would she sack any member of her cabinet who dared to propose a soft Brexit, and could she commit to keeping her election promise of bankrupting the country by leaving the single market and the customs union?May looked temporarily panicked and closed her eyes in fright. Hoping that when she reopened them, Paterson would have disappeared. But then she remembered there was no promise she had ever made that she hadn’t subsequently broken. So she might as well make another promise that she would break and tell him exactly what he wanted to hear. Maybot is as Maybot does. We’d definitely be leaving the single market and the customs union apart from the bits of them we might be staying in.As MPs became overwhelmed with the futility of the occasion and began drifting off to lunch, Labour’s Marsha de Cordova went for the jugular. It was clear that Esther McVey had broken the ministerial code was the prime minister going to sack her? May reverted to her default algorithm. “It’s very clear,” she said. McVey had only made a teensy-weensy mistake by twice misleading parliament and everyone deserved a second chance. So the work and pensions secretary would be making a half-hearted apology as a brief point of order at the end of PMQs. Was that OK?McVey, aka The Duracell Bunny, was quick to disabuse the prime minister. Her apology was going to be virtually non-existent, not half-hearted. “Yeahbutnobutyeahbutnobutyeahbutsowhat?” she said defiantly as the Labour benches called for her to resign. She wasn’t sorry. She’d never been sorry. The people who hadn’t got their universal credit payments on time deserved to starve. And she was going nowhere. Partly because she was entirely without shame. But also because the prime minister was too feeble to do the right thing. End of days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dd5d85b15805fe2b9e6ff4e84acfa588f99a83b/0_459_5903_3541/master/5903.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=486deb79e30496c1dbca9901c36af1ef","title":"earl of devon elected lords hereditary peers byelection","story":"Byelection makes ‘mockery of our democracy’, says head of Electoral Reform SocietyAn old Etonian aristocrat has won a lifetime seat in the House of Lords in a hereditary peer byelection with just seven votes.Charles Peregrine Courtenay, the earl of Devon, was among 19 aristocrats who stood for an election decided by 31hereditary crossbench peers. A practising barrister, Courtenay defeated his rivals, Lord Aldington and Lord Ravensdale, in the runoff. Courtenay, the 19th earl of Devon, owns the 12th-century ancestral home of Powderham Castle. In his candidate’s statement he referred to the property as his “800-year-old family SME, incorporating heritage tourism, sustainable land management, and community wellbeing”.He added: “I am 42, an able advocate and determinedly independent. I would be honoured to champion Devon in this House. I am London-based weekly.”The Queen’s nephew, the Earl of Snowdon, was among those whose name was put forward for the byelection, raising eyebrows that a member of the royal family would seek to join the legislature, but later withdrew from the contest.Other candidates includedLord Monson, an anti-skunk cannabis campaigner, and Lord Glenconner, a 24-year-old graduate. Both failed to win any votes.Darren Hughes, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said the election made “a mockery of our democracy” and that it was particularly egregious that it was held during National Democracy week. The slot became available after the retirement of the crossbencher Earl Baldwin of Bewdley. The system of such byelections followed the House of Lords Act 1999, which removed most of the hereditary peers from the upper house, and left seats for just 92, intended to be a temporary solution.Byelections are held whenever vacancies occur, because of death or retirement.In April 2016 seven candidates put themselves forward for a Liberal Democrat seat in an election decided by just three voters because only three hereditary peers in the Lords were Lib Dem members.Only candidates who have inherited a title are eligible to stand, and only if they have put their name forward to be included on the register of hereditary peers.

She also hails the “very rare and welcome event” of an England win in a penalty shootout.Jeremy Corbyn begins by calling for increased funding for the NHS and, of course, congratulating England. After a long build-up, the Labour leader’s first question is about an issue few people would have expected: buses. Does the PM accept her policy on bus travel has failed?May responds by blaming local authorities, saying they are responsible. She then contrasts her NHS spending plans with those promised by Labour at the last election.Corbyn asks again about buses, saying services have been reduced. “A bus pass isn’t much use if there isn’t a bus,” he says. May again defends her policies, saying local authorities must take responsibility. Corbyn again pushes her on the subject, asking if she believes buses should be left to the market.This might seem niche to some, but bus travel is a big issue – and disproportionately affects people on lower incomes. And more bus trips are made then journeys by train.Corbyn reiterates his points on bus travel, and points to the policy of London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, to freeze bus fares. May responds by saying bus travel in London is falling (it is, but there seem to be all sorts of reasons for this). The Labour leader demands new powers on transport for metro mayors.Corbyn sticks with the subject, using his now-traditional final peroration to emphasise the point that for many people, bus travel is “the only mode of transport available”. He says people across the nation have a right to regulated bus services.May – who it’s fair to guess, did not expect this subject to crop up – says it has been the Conservatives who have created metro mayors, and defends her record.Two days before the crunch Brexit summit at Chequers and with May facing near-open revolt from her MPs hours after the NAO accused Esther McVey of misleading parliament a day before the NHS’s 70th anniversary – it’s a good guess that not many people outside Corbyn’s key team knew that the subject of today’s PMQs would be bus services.But for all the regular airing of woes about rail travel in the Commons, this is a worthwhile and often-neglected subject, and one that affects millions of people, often in poorer communities. It didn’t make for the most dramatic PMQs clash of recent months, but the subject is a core Corbyn area, touching on poverty, social justice and the effects of privatisation and deregulation.I’m not sure we learned a vast amount about the subject apart from that fact that the prime minister hasn’t got a huge amount to say on it, beyond seeking to pass the responsibility on to local authorities, and a general attempt to take credit for metro mayors. So, one perhaps for the purists, but can be chalked down as a win for the Labour leader.Today’s most memorable line came from neither May nor Corbyn but Tory MP Scott Mann, whose starting line was:You wait forever for a bus question at PMQs, and then seven come along at once."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc8bde9481dd8bf96f45143faeb6c12904717fc4/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01ebbf3c547a7e28a633abe1f6e2f0b5","title":"len mccluskey signs letter accusing trans rights activists of intimidation","story":"Unite union leader later clarifies position saying he opposes ‘all hate crime including against trans people’Britain’s most powerful union leader has joined a group of feminist campaigners to sign a controversial letter that accuses some transgender rights activists of violent and intimidating behaviour.The Unite general secretary, Len McCluskey, was one of about 140 people, including Julie Bindel and Ruth Serwotka, who signed a letter in the Morning Star warning that a handful of recent episodes risked drawing “the whole of our progressive movement into disrepute”.The letter highlights a series of recent incidents, including the conviction of Tara Wood, 26, in April for the assault of Maria MacLachlan “a 60-year-old woman who had gathered with others in order to attend a meeting” to discuss “the potential impact on women and girls” of changes to the Gender Recognition Act.It also described a confrontation on a Bectu union picket line in March, saying that “trans activists, with no connection to the industrial dispute itself, mobbed and verbally attacked a female trade union member on the basis of having recognised her as an attendee at a similar meeting”.McCluskey initially said he had signed the letter “to improve the climate of debate around proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act” but immediately faced criticism for signing a document that appeared to make little reference to transgender rights.Laura Murray, the head of external relations in the office of Jeremy Corbyn, tweeted: “I’m apparently ‘disgusting’ and ‘not a feminist or a socialist’ because I stand against transphobia. But according to today’s letter in the Morning Star, all abusive behaviour in this debate comes from trans activists! Jesus wept.”The union leader clarified his position, tweeting that “I oppose all hate crime including against trans people” and said that Unite, whose policy conference is going on a Brighton, had agreed a more conciliatory “executive statement”.That asserted: “We oppose ision between our Women’s movement and our Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans movement, our campaigns to tackle discrimination are inclusive and member led.”Ministers this week launched a long expected consultation on potential changes to the Gender Recognition Act 2004 that would make it easier for transgender people to achieve legal recognition of an acquired gender – a prospect that has caused intense debate since it was first mooted in 2016.The act already allows people to change their gender without first having had surgical treatment, but since it came into force, 4,910 people have legally changed their gender, partly because it requires people to provide medical reports and other documentation to prove they have been living in their acquired gender for two years.Many feminists have questioned the implications of making it easier for people to reassign their gender, questioning for example whether it is appropriate to share women only spaces with male bodied people who identify as women. The Morning Star letter says its signatories do not share a particular position regarding the act, but concludes that “whatever your view ... you will agree it is unacceptable for women to be made scared to engage in political life”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fbd0790aaeb74791abf6725aed3f977df088c03/0_173_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc07ce3475131a9b75e93d6968501882","title":"chris froome tour de france bike racing","story":"Chris Froome, cleared by the UCI on Monday of any doping infraction, admitted he is keen to put the race promoters’ move to ban him from racing in this year’s Tour de France behind him as he prepares to defend his title, with the race starting on Saturday.“I’m extremely grateful that all the facts have been established and to draw a line under this and move on to bike racing again,” Froome said. “I knew that I didn’t do anything wrong. I’m extremely relieved and it’s a huge weight off my shoulders going into this year’s Tour, which is going to be the biggest challenge of my career.”As Team Sky faced the Tour de France press corps in rural Vendée, Froome and Sir Dave Brailsford maintained that Froome’s adverse analytical process should never have been made public.“When somebody’s accused of something they haven’t done and that becomes public, then anyone with any sense of fairness would look at that and think that’s challenging,” he said. “But what I look at is a young man who’s had that happen, his worst nightmare, and manage to maintain his dignity, his performance and win the Giro d’Italia in the meantime. To me that’s exceptional.”But Brailsford insisted that Sky would not be releasing any further detail on the ruling and that in fact the onus to share that with the public now lies with Wada and the UCI.“The shadow of doubt shouldn’t exist if we trust in our authorities,” he said. “The people who made the decision were Wada and the UCI, not Team Sky. I think that’s where the information about how that decision was made should come from.”But tensions surrounding Froome remain high. That nervousness was emphasised by the presence of the gendarmerie and his personal bodyguard at Wednesday’s press conference. After Team Sky took security advice from experts at BSkyB during a recent race in France, additional security is now expected to be implemented around Froome once the Tour is under way.Meanwhile the UCI president, David Lappartient, sought to explain further the UCI’s clearing of Froome. “An international federation such as the UCI has to follow the World Anti-Doping Agency,” he said. “They are the experts on this and their experts finally decided that this case was not an anti-doping rule violation so we had to follow the decision from Wada.”Brailsford said he was “absolutely confident since the day this started” that Froome had stayed within the permissible dose.“It was never in doubt for us that this whole thing would get cleared up. But that whole episode is over and Chris deserves a lot of credit for the way he’s handled that whole situation. That gives me a little bit of extra pride that I am part of this team leading into the Tour.”Froome and Sky may be feeling proud but others, including Tom Dumoulin, runner-up to Froome in May’s Giro d’Italia, are less enamoured of the outcome. “I’m not blaming Froome,” Dumoulin said. “He’s been cleared. It’s how the whole case has been handled, which is just a mess. It’s really unfortunate. It’s not what cycling needs.“It’s ruining the reputation of cycling and fans are probably walking away from the sport because of this,” the Dutch rider said, adding: “Nobody deserves to be showered with urine. Froome does not deserve that.”Froome, who had urine thrown at him in 2015 and was taunted by fans dressed in inhaler costumes during May’s Giro, also sought to calm the atmosphere. “If you’re not necessarily a Team Sky fan or a Chris Froome fan, come to the race, put a jersey on of the team you support and support the race in a positive way,” he said. “Don’t bring negativity to the race. That’s my advice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cb5aba00ea6973b8c03209b7d49ef1e08764d58/0_304_4385_2630/master/4385.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f0e06015a980cd7632ce3e149bfe30f","title":"england merlyn india t20 jos buttler","story":"England are expected to fire up the Merlyn spin-bowling machine in the nets at Cardiff on Friday as they search for a method to counter Kuldeep Yadav’s unconventional left-arm wrist spin in their Twenty20 series with India.The message from Jos Buttler, the vice-captain, was not to panic after Tuesday’s opening eight-wicket defeat at Old Trafford, despite a middle-order collapse induced by Kuldeep. The former seamer’s flighted “googlies” claimed five wickets for 24 including Eoin Morgan, Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root in the space of four balls.With such bowlers scarce in England the best option is turn to Merlyn for assistance before Friday’s second game at Sophia Gardens. The technology was introduced in 2005 to replicate Shane Warne before that summer’s Ashes and its inventor, Henry Pryor, claimed it can “bowl any ball known to man”.“Left-arm wrist-spinners seem quite hard to come by,” said Buttler, who top-scored with 69 in Manchester but was Kuldeep’s fifth victim. “One thing we can do is with Merlyn, to replicate the angle. It’s a very good machine to get used to that. But it was the first time some guys have faced Kuldeep and it may take one or two games, plus video.“Old Trafford was one game and it’s Twenty20. We are confident, we will stick to what has served us well, stay true to ourselves and come back hard at them in the next game.”England did not use Merlyn in the build-up to the series and its deployment now would not be viewed as a panacea. The message in the post-match debrief, which took place before the team watched their footballing equivalents the team watched their footballing equivalents win their penalty shoot-out with Colombia, which sparked wild dressing room celebrations, was that batsmen must remain calm and adapt.Buttler, who has faced Kuldeep in the Indian Premier League, said: “He’s a very good bowler. It’s now down to the guys to gain an understanding. You see it a lot in international cricket that guys burst on to the scene and then people get a handle on them.“It’s getting used to the angle as wrist spin is usually right-arm. We know we are a lot better than we showed during that little phase of the game.”India’s victory, sealed by a magnificent unbeaten century from KL Rahul, demonstrated the huge leap in intensity from the six short-form hammerings of Australia, not least given the vocal support for Virat Kohli’s side from the Manchester crowd and the heatwave in the UK that is creating dry surfaces for their spin bowlers.Buttler said: “The pitches will be what they are, so it is down to us to react.

The trainer David Evans was fined last year by racing’s ruling body for delaying notification of a non-runner, Tango Sky, so that he could back his other entrant, Black Dave, before its odds shortened, and he told Ladbrokes of his plan to withdraw Tango Sky at the time of placing his bet.Ladbrokes had maintained it could not be sure, three years after the event, of the reason why it shortened the odds of Tango Sky shortly after Evans’s bet. However, the Commission found proof it did so “in order to maximise Rule 4 deductions” from winning bets already placed, and that Ladbrokes “had failed to appropriately review all information available to them prior to initially providing … inaccurate explanations”.But Ladbrokes escaped punishment because its actions did not amount to a breach of the Commission’s licence conditions or code of conduct and the case pre-dated the Commission’s public statements about the fair application of Rule 4. Ladbrokes was given credit for bringing the case to the attention of racing’s regulator on the day of the race. It is understood the firm saved itself a mere £7.70 by trimming Tango Sky’s price in what was a weak race for turnover.The Commission has now set out the manner in which it expects all firms to apply Rule 4 and officials apparently regard this as a “line in the sand” moment.A Ladbrokes Coral statement said: “Our initial understanding of what had occurred when the price was changed proved to be incorrect, a fact that became apparent when we looked into the specifics.”It added that shortening Tango Sky’s odds was contrary to its trading policy at the time and that it has since emphasised to its traders that markets must be suspended immediately if they receive such information in future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd5d78bb7bee304a02ebd321cb489e6e62ea9a08/238_414_3200_1919/master/3200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70b45dcf00ed07aec509b9bae0b2a050","title":"lewis hamilton faith perspective f1","story":"Lewis Hamilton knows that risk is part of his business but has revealed that while his passion for Formula One is as strong as ever, he believes it is not worth dying for. As he prepares for this weekend’s British Grand Prix, the four-time world champion also emphasised the importance of his faith and despite the danger inherent in the sport, that: “God has his hand over me”.Hamilton is now in his 12th season in F1 and is expected shortly to confirm an extension to his contract with Mercedes for a further two years. He made his debut in 2007, when he was 22 years old, and took his first title in 2008 for McLaren, scoring three more with Mercedes in 2014, 2015 and 2017. Now one of the most experienced and successful drivers on the grid, he insists his enthusiasm is undiminished but tempered as part of a broader perspective on life.“I love racing,” he said in a podcast released on Wednesday. “I wouldn’t say F1 is worth dying for. Your dream, passion, ambition and goals can be worth dying for.”Hamilton had been greatly moved by a fan who told him she had cancer and was undergoing chemotherapy during his debut season and that his performances inspired her recovery.“It is hard to grasp that and to imagine what she is going through but she grabbed on to something,” he said. “That was maybe this young kid coming from nowhere but facing adversity, somehow fighting through it. That’s definitely worth fighting for, that’s definitely worth dying for, if you can touch one kid and put them on course for their potential.”Hamilton goes into the race at Silverstone, the third leg of F1’s first triple header after France and Austria, after a frustrating meeting at the Red Bull Ring. The Mercedes driver was forced to retire there and his 14-point lead in the world championship became a one-point deficit to Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel.The 33-year-old has always been open about his Christian faith and believes it plays a major role in his life and his racing. At the Nurburgring in 2007 during qualifying, a wheel nut that had not been located correctly caused his tyre to blow under heavy loading into turn eight at 160mph and his car to spear nose-first into the barrier. It illustrated the danger he knows is a constant companion in F1.“You don’t have time to pray,” he said of such incidents. “Anything can happen any day, but I feel God has his hand over me.” It is a belief strengthened by regular prayer and attendance at church. “I go with a couple of my close friends,” he said. “We meet, we go for breakfast and then we go to church together. We leave most often feeling enlightened and empowered, it’s like a re-centring.”Hamilton has matured as a driver and is at the peak of his powers, which are being put to the test for the second season in a row in a close title fight with Vettel, also a four-time world champion. The pair have exchanged the championship lead five times this year in nine races and intriguingly, drawing on Star Wars, Hamilton believes he is better able to deal with the battle mentally than ever.“My attitude to risk, in a sense it is more controlled, more calculated risk,” he said. “Whereas when I was a kid it was just pure adrenaline and pure balls. I have still got that, but I have also got the mental side. I am stronger in my mind than ever. It is almost like you can relate it to the movie with the force. He has the force within him but doesn’t know how to utilise it. I have the force within me but now I can control it.”That reaching this point has not been easy is well documented but Hamilton was also honest about how much opposition he faced, even as a child. “Parents of other drivers would say: ’You’re not good enough’. Grown adults telling an eight-year-old: ’You just don’t have it.’ It knocked me back,” he said. “I struggled at school, I was dyslexic and I was always behind because I was racing. My headmaster was a complete arsehole. He didn’t agree to me taking time off to race and would put me in detention for the day. I hated school.”Hamilton goes to the British Grand Prix as strong favourite, with the chance to surpass Jim Clark and Alain Prost with his sixth win at the race but is taking nothing for granted. With team errors costing him at three races this season, he sees the travails he has suffered as part of the sport.“Formula One has given me a life, given me a purpose, which is pretty special. But F1 has also broken me. It’s broken me and built me, broken me and built me,” he said. “When you go through it, you put so much into it, it breaks your heart and kills you when you fail, when you stumble, when everyone’s watching when you stumble. But, when you get back up and when you succeed it lifts you up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6df45dfde36806a97da5ecba45b49c6d8785879/0_17_5194_3117/master/5194.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3538abed549177c0f5e9749ad0bc750e","title":"the lieutenant of inishmore review aidan turner martin mcdonagh","story":"Noël Coward theatre, LondonThe Poldark star gives an excellent performance in a first-rate revival of Martin McDonagh’s brutally funny playPoldark fans turning up to see Aidan Turner in Martin McDonagh’s bilious, blood-strewn comedy may be in for a surprise. Instead of a liberal Cornish mine-owner, Turner plays – and very well, too – an Irish freedom fighter, Padraic, who is deemed too mad for the IRA. What is fascinating is seeing how a play, written in 1994 but not premiered until 2001, makes a subtly different impact today. I vividly recall the outrage the play originally caused. I remember an Irish critic fuming at what he saw as a slur on his nation and I had cat-loving friends who were equally incensed. Both parties were offended by a plot in which “mad Padraic”, a violent member of a republican splinter group, returns to his native Inishmore to find that his beloved cat, Wee Thomas, is deader than any doornail. Not fooled by desperate attempts to cover an orange cat with shoe polish to disguise Wee Thomas’s demise, Padraic vows revenge on his dad, Donny, and on the moggie’s assumed killer, Davey. But the plot thickens and the blood flows as Padraic is assailed by murderous gunmen and rescued only by Davey’s wild sister. This is comedy at its blackest. But a play that was hair-raisingly risky to stage in 2001, when bombing of the UK mainland was still current and the peace process was a pipe dream, now seems strangely prescient. It is obviously about Ireland, but its portrait of the sentimentality and sanctimonious rhetoric that often lies behind terrorist violence has acquired new resonance. McDonagh especially skewers the puritanism that is part of purblind devotion to a cause. When Padraic tortures a drug pusher who corrupts Catholic kids or declares, “I’m interested in no social activities that don’t involve the freeing of Ulster”, we might be listening to any form of religious fanaticism. McDonagh’s real gift, however, is for pushing a situation to its most brutal extreme, and being funny with it. This is Titus Andronicus played for laughs. Sometimes, the jokes are barely remarked, as when Davey, speaking of the local cats, says: “They’re all full of themselves.” Other times they are more visible. When Padraic vows not to marry Davey’s sister until Ireland is free, his father concludes: “That’ll be a long fecking engagement!” Far from being frivolous, however, the humour is all part of McDonagh’s ethical assault on the politics of revenge. This comes across clearly in Michael Grandage’s comically horrific production, set in a stone-walled cottage designed by Christopher Oram, where blood sprays the window panes as in a splatter movie. Turner is excellent as Padraic, and plays him not as some wild-eyed barbarian but as a man endowed with a demented innocence. When he tortures the pusher, he appears solicitous for his welfare. In other moments he seems unable to relate cause and effect. Addressing a colleague, one of whose eyes he shot with a crossbow, he remarks: “You never let bygones be bygones, you.” My abiding image, however, is of Turner caressing his dead cat with a tendresse he never displays to humans. Charlie Murphy as the girl for whom he finally falls, Chris Walley as her hapless brother and Denis Conway as Padraic’s dad all give good support. Although I could have done without an interval, this strikes me as a first-rate revival of a play that still instructively shocks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af4b382e9bbe9af38a2d1624c2e84d92a37ce611/0_46_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae844571c8e1923abbaef9edc6433c7b","title":"share your favourite family barbecue pics and win with birra moretti","story":"Celebrate the quintessential British summer tradition with Birra Moretti and you could win a countertop draught beer system for your home, plus a £250 Red Letter Days voucherWhat is it about summer that makes it so fantastic to cook in the great outdoors?

He has fired TV missivesmissiles from over there before\u0026nbsp– about his native south, native Americans on the big screen and country music. This time, he is taking on the big one: he is Sigmund Freud in a\u0026nbspcowboy hat, and is analysing the American\u0026nbspdream.There doesn’t seem to be much of it\u0026nbsp– the dream\u0026nbsp– around Lancaster, Ohio, today. It is, says Rich, “the kind of town that even Springsteen wouldn’t write a\u0026nbspsong about. It’s that grim.” Very little chance of making a\u0026nbspdecent wage here of having the chance to work with\u0026nbspdignity.What does the American dream even mean? The idea has been embedded in the US’s creation myth since the pilgrims arrived at Plymouth Rock, but the original hard-work ethic\u0026nbsp– and the very definition of success itself\u0026nbsp– has mutated over the years from something spiritual to something material to who-knows-what? Still, it’s the concrete that unifies Americans, even if that concrete looks seriously crumbly in\u0026nbspLancaster.To Plymouth first, though, where it all began, and where Hall’s dream chasing starts, too. No, “chase” sounds too fast. He may cover the first couple of centuries\u0026nbsp– from the Puritans and Calvinists whose character and fate were determined by their labours, or so they thought, to the beginning of industrialisation\u0026nbsp– quite speedily. But then he begins to meander, and I\u0026nbspmean that in the best possible\u0026nbspway.He strays across the Mason-Dixon Line, finds out what the American dream meant for cotton pickers, and mill workers, wage slaves and no-wage slaves. He takes in Grant Wood’s American Gothic recreates it, in fact, with his own pitchfork, though he can’t re-create the humourless blank look in the couple’s eyes\u0026nbsp– I\u0026nbspdon’t think Rich is desperate to get back to work in the fields, or loading pig\u0026nbspiron.The Great Depression, erosion of workers’ rights, Taylorism, false promise, the decline of Detroit\u0026nbsp… often the American dream looks more like a\u0026nbspnightmare. It’s not easy to take pride in your work when you don’t have a\u0026nbspjob.The story is littered with bad dreams, lumpy mattresses and lumpy metaphors. And, again, I\u0026nbspmean that in a\u0026nbspgood way. “As America expanded, more and more Europeans followed, trailing in the celestial prop wash of the floating female godhead of fortune,” he says. I\u0026nbspthink he’s talking about the boats they arrived on, and John Gast’s painting American Progress, in which a\u0026nbspgiant ethereal female spirit strides west, stringing telegraph wire as she goes. Whatever, I\u0026nbsplike it (Rich Hall’s proclamation less so the\u0026nbsppicture).As well as art, he wanders into literature (“in a\u0026nbspway, we’re all not-so-great Gatsbys”), architecture, Frank Lloyd Wright, the arts and craft movement, how modernism finally got to question the American dream\u0026nbsp– and movies and\u0026nbsptelevision.And he gets waylaid, mainly by his own laconic wit, but also by the need to ulge some not entirely important, but nevertheless fascinating, trivia\u0026nbsp– such as the fact that many of the now extremely valuable original mission-style oak rocking chairs designed by Gustav Stickley are owned by Barbra Streisand. Or to have a\u0026nbspdig at something\u0026nbsp– Kasabian (justifiably), Butlin’s (less so, I\u0026nbspthink), familiar reference points for us Britons who have never heard of\u0026nbspStickley.He also\u0026nbsp– justifiably\u0026nbsp– lays into self-improvement nonsense, personal growth and positive thinking, and the massive industry surrounding it.

The American dream: fake\u0026nbspnews.The title\u0026nbsp– Barry Davies: The Man, the Voice, the Legend (BBC One)\u0026nbsp– says it all, really.

But Netflix is hoping this gritty crime series will pull in a new, internet-savvy viewerNetflix’s plans for global domination take another step forward on Friday with the release of its first original Indian TV series Sacred Games. One of several Indian shows greenlit by the streaming service, it is hoped that the crime drama will follow in the footsteps of Narcos, another international series that revealed an appetite among western audiences to broaden their horizons. Yet perhaps the biggest challenge Sacred Games faces is whether it can win over domestic audiences closer to home.Based on the acclaimed book by Vikram Chandra, Sacred Games tells the story of Sartaj Singh, a jaded cop living under the shadow of his deceased father and seeking validation from a police force he nevertheless loathes for its corruption. When Singh receives an anonymous tip-off regarding the whereabouts of Ganesh Galtonde, a notorious crime lord who has been missing for 16 years, it sets the wheels in motion for a chain of events that burrows deep into India’s dark underworld.That there has been nothing like it on Indian television before goes without saying. In India, the small screen has always been considered a poor cousin to the mammoth film industry, dominated by soap operas about scheming mother-in-laws and tried-and-tested generic formats such as Indian Idol.Netflix has certainly cast its net wide in terms of audiences, with the hope that Sacred Games can pique the interest both of the urban youth who are already hooked on Stranger Things and 13 Reasons Why (both of which were among the most viewed Netflix shows in India last year), and also – with the internet becoming cheaper and more accessible than ever before – viewers from less affluent and rural areas.With this in mind, Sacred Games has cast instantly recognisable names from the film industry, including director Anurag Kashyap and Bollywood star, Saif Ali Khan. The veteran actor has starred in more than 60 Bollywood films, including Dil Chata Hai and Omkara, a Bollywood remake of Othello for which he won a Filmfare Award. But casting him was a calculated decision that went beyond merely looking at box-office statistics.Khan hails from an aristocratic background – his father, Mansoor Ali Khan, descends from one of the ruling Nawab families under the Moghul emperors and was a former captain of the Indian cricket team, while his mother is Bollywood legend Sharmila Tagore – and the combination of his Bollywood celebrity and his prestigious background gives the series both the commercial star power to attract the masses and much-needed kudos to attract the crowd who traditionally look down on Indian TV.“We don’t know how many people are going to come to Netflix or whether it’s just going to be the English-speaking audiences in India. There are many questions, but the possibilities are huge,” he adds.If Sacred Games is courting a global audience, it is nevertheless unapologetically local in its focus. This is an ode to Mumbai, with the city as much a character of the series as Minneapolis in Fargo or Baltimore is the Wire. There is a Dickensian quality to Mumbai and this is reflected in Sacred Games. One character describes it as “a slum with palaces growing out of it” and the fault lines between these two worlds are brought to life in the show.“We have affluent people with a really shocking attitude to the poverty on their doorsteps and in that sense it is a pretty rough place,” said Khan, who refers to the city by it’s former name, Bombay.Through Sacred Games, Khan hopes that Indians – as well as international audiences – will confront the realities of cities such as Mumbai. “Bombay is a crazy city and I think it is a much more realistic show than anything we have done in the past,” he suggests. “However, there is a beauty is those contradictions that we rarely see on screen, and I hope we have captured that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74449c5b72972d5fedfa528728fdc0cc08ea7a00/0_244_5472_3284/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d32e8a0c95b45055f4d746dd6bba3cae","title":"fourth of july alternative celebrations","story":"Alternative things to do if you’re not a fan of hotdogs, fireworks or immigration policyThis year in particular if feels as though there’s not that much to celebrate. Our trollish president has spent his first two long-feeling years in office alienating our allies and was just caught trying to goad Nato countries into paying him protection money like some kind of mob boss. On top of it all, Koko the gorilla, our greatest national treasure, is now dead. It’s enough to make you reassess the totality of our nation’s history and only think about the bad parts – of which there are many – and reach the perfectly reasonable conclusion that our country is not worth celebrating at all and never has been.This leaves us with quite the quandary: what’s a young person to do on America’s birthday when America itself isn’t much of a priority?If you have the Fourth of July off, you might as well put your free time to good use. For some people, that could mean dedicating the day to something bigger than themselves. Others may want to go about their Fourth in a more-or-less normal way while tweaking the particulars to subvert the holiday’s patriotism. Or perhaps you just want to slack off and have a slight reprieve from life in America for just one day. Here are some suggestions – some specific, some more general – as to how to accomplish all that.It’s hot on the Fourth of July, and you know what melts in the heat? Ice. And, if you happen to be in Philly, you’ve also got a chance to help melt Ice, aka Immigration and Customs Enforcement, whose Philadelphia branch is one of the most active – and actively protested – in the country. Head to Ortlieb’s in Philadelphia for a night of dancing to the smooth sounds of the local house DJ Steve J while donating to Juntos, a local Latinx immigrants’ rights group dedicated to resisting Ice from every angle.The greatest secret in all of sports is that minor league baseball games are way more fun than major league games. The tickets are cheap, the players are passionate, and all the teams have weird names like the New Orleans Baby Cakes and the Batavia Muckdogs. You can look up your local team here. Here’s hoping your club is wearing their special Jar Jar Binks jerseys or throwing a George Costanza Appreciation Night.Speaking of the short, stocky bald man, you and some friends could always try to recreate the classic Seinfeld episode The Summer of George and hit your city’s disc golf (or, as George calls it, “frolf”) course. For bonus points, bring along a cooler full of the Summer of George cocktail, a variation of the mai tai that incorporates St George liqueur. (Also, if you do this, please drink lots of water, as it will be very hot out and mai tais are known to be dehydrating.)If you hadn’t heard, weed is legal in Colorado, which means that businesses can take any ostensibly boring activity, introduce marijuana into the equation, and – presto! – have a goofily fun event for the masses. That’s the idea behind CannaBingo at Colorado Springs’ Studio A64, a bar-like “cannabis club” where alcohol is switched out for the sticky icky stuff, and bingo transforms from a yawner of a game into a Sisyphean gauntlet of giggle-filled confusion. If the Fourth of July is a day where you can pretend to be retired for 24 hours, you might as well smoke some ganja and do retired-people stuff.You might have the day off, but you know who doesn’t? The millions of very good dogs and cats stuck in America’s animal shelters waiting to be adopted. Literally all of them would very much like to hang out with you on this wonderful Fourth of July. Even if you can’t adopt or foster one yourself, you can head to an adoption center near you and spend the day helping to socialize the animals so they can learn how to become the furry friends in a forever-home that they were meant to be.It’s totally understandable that, despite how much of a dumpster fire you feel America is at the moment, you might want to do the standard-issue Fourth of July stuff for reasons that have nothing at all to do with America itself. In which case, perhaps consider hosting a barbecue serving co-op-purchased food (find a co-op near you by clicking here) while slamming beers from employee-owned breweries and blasting this playlist of anti-capitalist jams.

During the news conference he stated his commitment to helping the fight against Islamist militants in the north-east, before embarking on the hour-long flight to Lagos to visit the New Afrika Shrine. The venue replaced the famed original that was created by Fela, which burned down in 1977. It is managed by the musician’s sons Femi and Seun, who continue their father’s musical and cultural tradition. Fela, a singer, composer and saxophonist, pioneered the Afrobeat sound by combining organ riffs with west African drumming and brass instruments. He was also famed for his fearless critiques of Nigeria’s military regime. “Fela was not just a musician. He was a politician who wanted to change society,” Macron told the audience from the stage. “So if I have one message for young people, it’s this: Yes, politics is important yes, be involved.”Fela was jailed on dozens of occasions by military rulers in the 1970s and 1980s, including by Buhari during his time as a military leader in the early 80s. The presence of the French president brought a different ambience to the famed venue. During an evening in which classic Fela songs were played alongside contemporary artists and a fashion show was held, the French president told the audience Nigeria was important for African culture.He said France planned to launch a season of events intended to be “the face of African culture in Europe”. “It will be about a new generation of African artists – for them by them,” he said. The visit to Nigeria has marked a return to familiar territory for Macron. He spent six months in Abuja as an intern at the French embassy in 2002. When asked about previous visits to the legendary Lagos club, he said: “I can’t tell you everything that happened when I used to come to the Shrine – because what happens at the Shrine stays at the Shrine.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78836b8de124db924bff758ac813eed219c74c75/1084_885_4676_2806/master/4676.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ea48a5363fc7e399a8b6737c7c20dd0","title":"london clubs and racism the west end is a hostile environment","story":"It is midnight on a warm midsummer’s night in Mayfair, central London. Across wide lanes of traffic – ceaseless, even at this hour – I can just about make out the dark silhouette of Hyde Park’s trees. But it is a dozen plastic-wrapped parking tickets, slapped on a primary-coloured Lamborghini beside me, that I can hear flapping in the breeze.I am at the Hilton Park Lane hotel, the super-rich heart of the super-rich centre of London. The sports cars are not only symbols of extreme wealth, but of the attitudes that accompany it, that allow the car-owners to treat parking fines as if they were an upmarket meter system.Tonight, the latter is prophetic. The velvet rope separating the “abnoxious” from the rest of us is struggling to contain a show-stoppingly beautiful black woman, who is shouting at the door staff.“They know me. They invited me down here. And now they don’t want to let me in because of my colour,” she yells. “Don’t deny the fact that black people are poppin’. You play our music. Do I need to say any more?”When I talk to the 24-year-old, she explains why she is so furious at being denied entry. “I’ve been standing in the line and seeing bare white people going in before me,” she says. “Personally, I think this is a colour thing. Black people are not allowed in central London, I swear to you. The way Mayfair works for me, you’ve got to look like a certain something – you have got to be white, tall, really slim.”She describes herself as an “influencer” and says she does not want to be named because she fears the consequences to her profile. But, she continues: “I’m a party girl, I go out all the time. And as black women, we are always being disrespected – we can’t go out there and have a good time, without them reminding us about our colour.”In this sentiment she is not alone. Last month, another young black woman, out clubbing to celebrate the end of her exams, alleged that she was charged twice as much for entry to Drama as white girls in the queue. The club denied that this was the case, saying that both white and black members of the group were charged £20 for entry.“We do not tolerate any form of discrimination against any inidual or group,” the club said in a statement. “The standard door charge at Drama Park Lane is £20. Promotions are offered for various reasons, but never on the grounds of discrimination of race, colour or national origin.” The club is now investigating both the allegations.But on social media, the young woman’s mother, TV producer Nadine Marsh-Edwards, said: “My daughter went to a club in the West End last night. Black girls got charged £20 entrance fee – white girls £10 … London life right now. They need to be reminded it’s London 2018 not Mississippi 1962.”The club contacted Marsh-Edwards, although her comments have led to further allegations, many citing almost identical experiences, throwing a spotlight on reviews of Mayfair clubs on TripAdvisor, where allegations of racism are common, stretching back several years.On the night I went clubbing in Mayfair I saw this flexible door policy at first hand. Drama’s £20 entry fee was quickly waved away when I made a vague excuse, leaving me the impression that it is considered small change when compared to the takings inside.Until about a decade ago, I was no stranger to the Mayfair and central-London club scene. Devotees of hip-hop and R\u0026ampB, my friends and I knew the DJ schedule at most of the clubs by heart, and would go wherever they were playing our favourite music. On a good day, we could blag our way in for free, but most of the time, we paid £10 or £20. But, as a black girl, you always felt your game had to be tight. Those of mixed race, like me, had an easier time than our friends with darker complexions who seemed to be judged more critically by doorstaff. The threat of exclusion was always lurking just under the surface.But, descending beneath the Lamborghini-lined entrance to Drama, those days seem like a more innocent time. The first thing that struck me was the prevalence of cosmetic surgery. Next, that this was a club devoted not to dancing, but to “tables” – booths topped with grey ice buckets for super-sized, frosted bottles of spirits that cost those enjoying them up to £1,000. The dancefloor is an afterthought – a few square metres of space we had to share with a disproportionate number of security guards and a couple of women in thongs, who occassionally burst into unprovoked episodes of twerking. Champagne, the drink of choice at the bar, was an eye-watering £17 a glass.About a quarter of the club’s floor space was shut off altogether – an unoccupied and unlit VIP area. It felt like a metaphor for the whole experience of going to a club that is always aspiring to a wealthier, more important and famous clientele.During the period I was in the club, out of about 150 clubbers, I saw just one group of five bored-looking black boys, slumped around a table, and one black woman in a large table-less group of white friends. Among the staff, we observed just one black man.When we moved on to nearby Scandal, a larger club closer to the heart of the West End, there were more people dancing. There were also slightly more people from minority ethnic groups and a black DJ. But with the exception of one dancer among the half-dozen or so women performing provocative moves in little cubby holes built into the walls, I could see no black women at all. The club declined to comment.It is black women, critics say, who are the net losers in the current Mayfair club game. Fashion blogger Fisayo Longe recently described her experience at Libertine, writing that she was denied entry and was told it was: “Maybe because you’re black,” and “… probably because you’re not good looking enough”. The nightclub has denied this, saying the records from their ID scanner prove they have a varied demographic. “We can categorically state that we do not have a door policy that is based on the colour of people’s skin.”In 2015, the nightclub DSTRKT refused entry to a group of black women who say they were told they were “too dark” and “overweight”. The nightclub denied this and says the club was full. The same year, Cirque le Soir rejected a group of New Orleans Saints NFL players, despite the fact that they had reservations. The players reported being told it was because they were “six big guys” (none was over 6ft) and “too urban”. The nightclub denied this, saying the men were refused entry because they were in an all-male group.TripAdvisor reviews of the past few years report clubs including Libertine, Drama and Cirque le Soir splitting up mixed groups of friends, with only the white members allowed in. “Eww, your kind isn’t allowed in here,” one girl reports a staff member telling her and an Asian friend. Other reviews of some Mayfair clubs dating back to January 2017 include the headlines “undercover Nazis” and “Racist Club! No black people allowed!” But in a society where British people of colour face discrimination at work, racist abuse on the streets and even deportation, do unpleasant experiences at a handful of nightclubs really matter?Marsh-Edwards thinks so. “This is the start of a young person’s life out in the world, and these sort of micro-aggressions tell you a lot about how you are seen by society,” she says. “Some of these girls are going to end up running companies, they are going to go into that boardroom one day, probably as the only woman and highly likely the only black person. And they have already been told they are not worthy, and not on a level playing field.”In a world where discretion is seen as a core asset, it was difficult to find anyone who works in the Mayfair club scene who would allow their name to be used for this article. One promoter, who is black, says he witnessed overt racial discrimination over more than a decade working in Mayfair and the West End. “I can go into any club with 10 hot, blond models and be given a table and a bottle,” he says. “But I can go with 10 black girls, who are beautiful, and be kept on the door.“I used to have so many fights with club-owners about this. My own sister got turned away on her 40th birthday from a club I was working at – she came with six black women, they had booked a table two months in advance and there was nothing I could do to get them in. Well-dressed, smart-looking black people getting turned away.” Despite his personal objection to the policy, he continued making money from it. “I was walking away with hundreds of pounds for bringing in girls. The clubs would do a ‘quality check’ – they would give you marks out of 10 for the girls that you bring. They just need to be hot. Hot, and predominantly white.A popular Mayfair club DJ argued that while there was undoubtedly racism, it was elitism that was the main issue. “I remember once bringing two black friends to a club where I worked, and being told: ‘You cannot bring two black people in here at the same time because it looks like a gang.’ So I’m not going to deny there is racism. Some of it comes from the way the media portrays black people. Some is similar to the racism you get in the fashion industry, with this idea that black people just don’t look good.“But this is not so much about race as about money,” he says, describing how a pair of Nigerian clients at Drama regularly spent £30,000 each visiting the club. “Clubs want to attract the people who are going to spend the most, so they want good-looking people, people who look desirable and enticing, because that’s what brings in the people with money. That can work against black people, but I’ve seen it work in favour of black people too.”The importance of catering to the tastes of the super-rich is a recurring theme. Another promoter, who specialises in bringing clientele from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states to London’s clubs, said it was deciphering their wishes that led to some of the most problematic decision-making in some Mayfair clubs.“The objective of these clubs is to sell alcohol, and club-owners have built up stereotypes based on spending patterns,” he explains. “So, for example, some owners will tell you that they don’t want Asians coming in because they drink before they come out. Black people don’t drink much either. The best clients are Norwegians, because they drink a lot. So there is a kind of logic behind the way they discriminate.“Right now, it’s ‘Gulf season’. Societies like Saudi are very restrictive, but Ramadan is especially strict, so as soon as it’s finished, wealthy young people go to the other extreme. All the luxury industries in Europe try to cater to them.” Essentially, racialised stereotypes are being cited as a business model.Yet the serious nature and sheer volume of allegations of racial discrimination have attracted the attention of the local authorities, which are now investigating. When I put the allegations to Amy Lamé, London’s first night tsar, appointed by mayor Sadiq Khan, she said she was in touch with those involved. “We take these allegations extremely seriously and are working with Westminster council and the politan police to stamp this out.”A spokesperson from the council, which has responsibility for licensing – powers some have suggested should now be used to sanction nightclubs who practise discrimination – explained its plans to tackle the allegations: “Racism has no place in Westminster. That is why we have this week launched a task group to look into the standards of inclusion and access to the evening and night-time economy. This will include trading standards and issues such as discounted entry and promotions. If we find evidence of any racial discrimination we will take action.”But evidence could be hard to find. One promoter I spoke to said he could see why black clubbers claimed racism was involved, but insisted: “These clubs are based on image. The reason people come here is because of the exclusivity and glamour. If we let all of them in, it would no longer be either exclusive or glamorous. So in a way, by coming here and getting upset when they get rejected, they are victims of their own fantasy.”Is racism, even if it can be proved, actually a symptom rather than the cause of what is really going wrong in Mayfair clubs? The clubs I visited – Drama and Scandal – are unapologetic about their intentions to be elitist and discriminatory, not on grounds on race, but desirability, beauty and wealth. Scandal, for example, describes itself as “the ultimate nightlife experience for a privileged few”. It is hard not to feel unwelcome in a club that plays black music, in a city with a visible black community, where black people are noticeable by their absence. It was uncomfortable for my friend Lola and I, doing our best to enjoy the music amid the tables, stunts and strippers. But, when you consider what it says about our society, and how we cater to the whims of the super-rich, it really means a whole lot more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bd36dda1f8ae583d3eded02b4d27bf954636f58/0_0_2655_1593/master/2655.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dc46fb2f9eecdbb447307c9fce760cc","title":"merkel defends migration policy after seehofer showdown","story":"Beleaguered chancellor gives first speech to parliament since meeting with interior ministerAngela Merkel has sought to defend her government’s migration policy in her first speech to parliament since a showdown with the interior minister, Horst Seehofer, over the policing of Germany’s borders.The German chancellor spoke up for the compromise agreement the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) struck with its smaller partner, the Christian Social Union (CSU), to erect transit zones along the southern German border to speed up the deportation of ineligible asylum seekers, insisting migration had to be better regulated.“We must have more regulation regarding every type of migration, so that people have the impression that law and order are being enforced,” Merkel told a packed Bundestag, in a speech intended to show she is still in control after intense speculation that her 13-year chancellorship was about to end.Stressing that migration was a “global problem requiring a global solution” and countries could not go it alone, she said the EU’s future was dependent on a solution being found.“How we deal with the migrant question will decide whether Europe continues to exist in the future,” she said, referring to her fraught attempts to secure deals with other EU members to accept the return of refugees who had registered in their countries.At the same time, she underlined the necessity of protecting Europe’s outer borders more effectively as well as agreeing partnerships with African countries to tackle illegal migration and lessen the incentives for economic migration.But the chancellor, looking tired and pale after weeks of late-night negotiations in Brussels and Berlin, came under fire from almost all parties, in particular the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany, whose parliamentary leader, Alice Weidel, demanded her immediate resignation.“Under your regime, Germany has shifted from being a motor and stability guarantor to a driver of chaos,” she said. She referred to the battle within Merkel and Seehofer’s conservative alliance as “undignified theatrics”, and Germany as “a madhouse, the headquarters of which is the chancellery”, before urging Merkel to “put an end to this tragedy – please resign at last”.While Weidel spoke, Merkel had her head down, concentrating on the finishing touches to a speech on the nation’s budget.Christian Lindner, the head of the pro-business Free Democrats, accused Merkel of having failed to find a satisfactory solution to the government’s refugee policy since the late summer of 2015, when nearly 1 million refugees arrived in Germany.He accused Merkel of failing to consult her junior coalition partner, the Social Democratic party (SPD), which crucially has yet to give its go-ahead to the transit zones. The party is in a quandary over whether to accept the zones, which many members have compared to prisons and even concentration camps, or risk the collapse of the coalition.The SPD was quick to attack Seehofer, who had offered his resignation as minister and CDU leader on Sunday, blaming him for bringing the government to the brink of collapse with his so-called migration masterplan, over certain details of which he and Merkel have been at loggerheads.Andrea Nahles, the SPD leader, said: “We don’t need masterplans, we need good craftsmanship.”Other SPD members stressed that the transit zones were a fudge, not least because on average, only five asylum seekers a day were currently attempting to enter Germany via the south.Among the fiercest critics of Seehofer was Dietmar Bartsch, the parliamentary leader of the far-left Die Linke. That Seehofer was sitting in the Bundestag on his 69th birthday, he said, should be viewed as a one-off birthday treat. “You will not be sitting here as interior minister on your 70th birthday,” he said. Bartsch accused the CSU of a ruthless attitude towards refugees, insisting the “C” in CDU and CSU no longer stood for “Christian” but for “chaos”.To resounding laughter across the chamber, he said: “I believe you would have smilingly deported Jesus.” Seehofer sat in contemplative silence, his chin in his hand, not once contributing to the debate.Merkel’s next hurdle will be to secure the support of the SPD, which has been holding emergency meetings round the clock to discuss whether it is ready to approve the transit zones, but has yet to reach a unified position, with most misgivings coming from the left wing of the party.Neighbouring Austria’s position also remains open. Its government, which on Tuesday expressed its scepticism about the transit zones, has yet to agree to back them, not least because this would require Vienna to agree to take back refugees who had registered in Austria.Seehofer is due to travel to Austria on Thursday in an attempt to hammer out a deal with the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz.In an interview with German television, Merkel gave a little more detail about the way the transit centres would work, insisting it was wrong to view them like prisons and adding that people would be kept in them for a maximum of two days. The centres work on the basis that they would house those asylum seekers who had registered in other EU countries before being returned to those countries. Asked by German television whether the new policy marked a toughening of her migration stance, and whether the once “open door” Merkel had turned into the “closing off” chancellor, she replied: “No, a clear no.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3554189.1530731338!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"more than 25 000 unbuilt homes have planning permission","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Construction Industry Federation says many schemes that had been granted permission remain “unviable”. Photograph: David DaviesPA WireDublin’s developers are sitting on planning permission for more than 25,000 houses and apartments, new figures compiled by the four Dublin local authorities show.The figures from the Dublin housing supply taskforce, to be published by the Department of Housing on Thursday, show that at the end of the first quarter of the year 3,724 houses and 3,629 apartments were under construction across the capital but planning permission for 25,053 homes remained unused. Almost two-third of the permitted but unbuilt homes are apartments.Despite the strong recovery in Dublin property prices, the Construction Industry Federation said many schemes that had been granted permission remained “unviable” and developers were likely to hold off on construction of apartments until the Minister for Housing published new height guidelines.The total number of houses and apartments under construction did increase by 27 per cent from 5,800 in the first quarter of last year to 7,353 at the same time this year. There was also an increase in the number of “active” building sites from 151 in the first quarter of 2017 to 173 this year.The department describes the figures in relation to extant planning permissions as “relatively positive” with fewer houses waiting to be built than in the same period last year. However the number of homes completed remains low, with 183 houses finished in the first three months of the year, and just 65 apartments all of which were in the South Dublin County Council area.In addition to the unbuilt homes which have planning permission, 47,312 houses and apartments could be built of land which is ready for development, without the requirement for any infrastructural investment. Another 29,272 homes could be built on land which is waiting for State investment in infrastructure, while 24,380 homes could be built on sites which are dependent on investment by Irish Water.Hubert Fitzpatrick, director of housing and planning with the Construction Industry Federation, said a grant of planning permission does not mean development is feasible.“Planning permission doesn’t imply viability and many sites are still unviable, where the costs aren’t meeting the market value. In each case the local market will have to be assessed and, particularly for apartments in some cases it won’t be possible to proceed.”Many planning permissions for apartments would also be defunct once Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy issues new guidelines allowing the construction of taller apartment blocks, Mr Fitzpatrick said.“We are still waiting for the Minister to issue guidelines on height. We do expect them in the next few weeks, but it will be inevitable that people will look again at their sites and may go back to change, or seek new planning permission.”A spokesman for the department said the guidelines would be issued shortly.

File photograph: PASomething serious had to be going down.A harmless photo opportunity involving shovels and shirt-sleeves was there for the taking, but the Taoiseach cried off at short notice. He had been due to face the cameras with Ministers Eoghan Murphy and Paschal Donohoe.“This morning I came off a plane at 1.30 from New York, so that’s where I was.”The tasty photo-op was scheduled for 10am.Presuming he meant his flight departed at 1.30am Irish time, he could have made the gig if he really wanted to.That excuse has a slight ring of fake news of it.Here’s the truth.Leo Varadkar was at home, on the phone, frantically searching for the run of himself, which he has a worrying habit of losing when he travels abroad.What was it this time, sez you?He only went and insulted the media, and political journalists in particular.It happened at a lunch where he was trying to impress a group of high-flying young Irish men and women who are making it in New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made of, etc.Trailblazing media, money and techie types. Leo’s kind of people. He gets them. Then they go and rat him out to journalists.He also gets Donald Trump, or at least he gets the president’s irritation with the media and “sympathises” with him. The Donald don’t get no breaks with these media bums. And Leo knows how he feels.Leo gets it. But he doesn’t appear to get how dangerous the Trump rhetoric is for truth and democracy.The Taoiseach sees hacks hanging around Leinster House in packs looking for stories. Did you ever know the like? As the Donald would say, and Leo concurred on this point over lunch with the happening youth, they aren’t interested in the truth. Although when a politician says a journalist isn’t interested in the truth it’s usually because that politician can’t handle the truth.Earlier this year in the Dáil he accused one newspaper of peddling fake news. It wasn’t. But that doesn’t matter. And in January, in Davos, he revealed his sneaking regard for Trump’s attitude to serious journalism.Anyhow, when news of the latest thrilling episode of Taoiseach on Tour hit town, the Leinster House reporters did their best to appear hugely annoyed. Amid fears tablets would have to be administered to bring down the abnormally high levels of dudgeon among the ranks, Varadkar moved to defuse the situation while his opposition counterparts shamelessly milked it.The Fianna Fáil leader talked about the homelessness crisis, blasting the government for the lack of urgency and delivery in its response to it. He cited the many announcements made about various schemes “and the media was very fair to you” and “they reported you faithfully”. Along the way, he craftily stitched in references to the media and its sympathetic treatment of him.Mary Lou McDonald abandoned any attempt to introduce a masking issue and went straight in with a few haymakers on his reported remarks on the Irish media. “You have confirmed in part these remarks that you are in sympathy with president Donald Trump and that you believe that Irish journalists have no interest in the truth.”For all the things he was saying now about context and the rest she believed “you simply wanted to have a go”.The Taoiseach came prepared with a large page covered in tiny handwritten notes, complete with big inky bullet points and shaky lines drawn around particular sentences.When he got a chance to reply, he said his piece. “I profoundly regret if anyone in the country thinks that in any way that I don’t support a free press or don’t respect the work of journalists.” Cornerstone of democracy, and all that.Although the media is not above reproach or criticism, he stressed. Which is proper order.No, it’s people like Donald Trump, or those who share his views on the media, who want to be beyond reproach.Leo is irked that what he said was leaked. “I’d like to be able to respect the privacy of that event, but obviously that isn’t now possible.” He is annoyed that what he said at the lunch was taken out of context, although people in Leinster House on Tuesday were puzzling over what context Trump’s views on the media might be acceptable.They were also puzzled by his comments about the Irish media trivialising the news and chasing tittle-tattle and gossip. (Some of us have to do it.) Leo seems to find this very distasteful. This amused Micheál Martin hugely.Too many political journalists interested in gossip? “I mean, former taoiseach Enda Kenny would have been very interested in hearing that because he considered you quite notorious in feeding the rumour mill in Leinster House on an ongoing basis with journalists and you weren’t remiss in that regard.”How very true.When we throw in fun runs and gym kits and posing with animals and novelty socks, Leo really finds himself up to his oxters in pot calling the kettle black territory.How did the Taoiseach get himself into such a pickle? For all his media savvy, when meeting a group of media savvy young people, he didn’t think his remarks would get out. The same thing happened Boris Johnson recently, and he’s supposed to be very intelligent too.Above everything, Leo seemed miffed that he was caught out.Of course, we’re all rather hurt now. How could you do this to us, Leo? You know how sensitive we are.Indeed, this has been a most difficult sketch to write.It is practically impossible to type while clutching your pearls and reaching for the smelling salts.I’m off to lie down in a darkened room."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3553665.1530711233!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach notorious for feeding gossip to political journalists","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichaél Martin told the Dáil  the ‘really concerning aspect’ of Leo Varadkar’s comments in New York were that he was ‘in sympathy with President Trump in terms of the media’. File photograph: CollinsTaoiseach Leo Varadkar was “quite notorious” as a minister for feeding journalists in Leinster House with gossip the Dáil was told in the ongoing controversy over his remarks about the media at a lunch in New York.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin cited former taoiseach Enda Kenny on the issue in the wake of Mr Varadkar’s remarks when the issue came up for a second time in the House on Wednesday.The controversy first arose when the Taoiseach was reported to have said Donald Trump’s criticism of the media was one of the few things he could sympathise with the US president about.Earlier Mr Varadkar had told the Dáil he profoundly regretted if anyone in the country thought he did not respect the media but he said journalists were not above reproach or beyond criticism.But when the issue was raised a second time, Mr Martin referred to some of the Taoiseach’s criticisms including that political journalists were more interested in gossip in Leinster House than in the workings of Government.Mr Martin said “former taoiseach Enda Kenny would have been very interested in hearing that because he considered you quite notorious in feeding the rumour mill in Leinster House on an ongoing basis with journalists”.The Fianna Fail leader added that the “really concerning aspect” of Mr Varadkar’s comments in New York were that he was “in sympathy with President Trump in terms of the media because President Trump is probably one of the worst examples of a political leader who regularly demonises media”. He also said Mr Varadkar also condemned print media and said “they were jealous because social media takes their business”, but Mr Martin added that social media had been shown to distort news.He referred to the Taoiseach’s criticisms of the media and comments that 80 per cent of the media’s treatment of Government was critical “and you had a problem with that and wanted to rebalance it”.And he asked what was the Taoiseach doing to create greater media plurality.Mr Varadkar said however that “anyone can distort the news. It’s not just social media”. “There’s lots of people well capable.”The Taoiseach said nobody liked being criticised. “I don’t like it,” he said telling Mr Martin “you’re very sensitive about it in particular when it happens”.He cited Government efforts to assist media and said they estimated that the cut in Vat to 9 per cent was worth about €100 million to the print industry.They are bringing in the Broadcasting Act, which will reduce the broadcasting levy on independent companies by up to 50per cent and they announced a new scheme to provide bursaries to young journalists working in local or community radio and the Defamation Act was being reviewed, he said.“These are all things I don’t think you’d see being done by the US administration.”Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald asked if the Taoiseach was “deliberately missing the point” and suggesting that the commentary attributed to him was wrong.She said Mr Varadkar had not denied the fact that he aligned his views with those of President Trump but was “rather coy” about the detail of which part of his analysis the Taoiseach agreed with.Mr Varadkar said it was a private lunch and he was not quoted in full.Media ownership was not a topic that was raised at the lunch, with between 15 and 20 young Irish people.But he was very aware that Reporters Without Borders had raised concerns that the Independent Group is too powerful in the print media and RTÉ was too dominant in broadcasting and “I am open to suggestions as to how we can solve that”.Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said if the Taoiseach really wanted a free and fair media “you should help with funding”.He claimed it was a “do nothing Government” in relation to media, a claim the Taoiseach rejected as he reiterated efforts in relation to Vat and other measures.But he added that “I’d have concerns about funding media, particularly private sector media. I think it would damage their independence.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3553575.1530705782!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach profoundly regrets if anyone thinks he does not respect the media","story":"An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that he profoundly regrets if anyone thinks he does not respect the media after comments he made at a private lunch in New York.

Mr Varadkar was responding to Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald who raised the controversy over the Taoiseach’s remarks at the lunch in which he said Donald Trump’s criticism of the media was one of the few things he could sympathise with the US president about.Mr Varadkar insisted that he “strongly believed that a free press was important in a democracy” and was as important to democracy as parliament and courts.Sometimes there are tensions between Government and media, he said, adding that “at the same time it should not consider itself above criticism or beyond reproach”.Ms McDonald said the Taoiseach had called the event he attended a private lunch but it was “an event paid for by the Irish taxpayer”. She cited Mr Varadkar’s reported remarks that “you were in sympathy with Donald Trump and you believed Irish journalists had no interest in the truth”.She added that “you have attacked Irish investigative journalism and cited RTÉ in particular.“You cite programmes that expose scandals” in hospitals, for carers and the failures of the Government to protect those in care.Ms McDonald said that if the Taoiseach was genuinely concerned about the media “you might have remarked on the issue of media ownership and in particular the power of Denis O’Brien in the media landscape”, and his dominance that had had a chilling effect on journalism.She claimed that the Taoiseach was not interested in that but “you just wanted to have a go”.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin also took a swipe at the Taoiseach in a question about homelessness and housing when he repeatedly said the media had very fairly and faithfully reported the Government’s housing announcements. But defending his remarks, Mr Varadkar said the US event was a “ two-hour lunch with young Irish people living in New York to hear what their thoughts were”.He said the conversation touched on Brexit, the UN, Russia and many different other things. The conversation included social media and fake news.“I said a lot of positive things about media - I acknowledged the Me Too movement and Harvey Weinstein and exposing him.”“I also said that I thought I got a fair hearing in general from the media. None of that was reported.”He added that his only reference to RTÉ was specifically about the Prime Time Investigates programme Mission to Prey when he said false allegations about a priest fathering a child in Africa were made."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3552736.1530634201!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"athens keeps apprehensive eye on erdogan and dodecanese islands","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPoster for Turkey’s  president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, at Taksim Square in Istanbul: it reads “Thank you Istanbul”.  Photograph: Bulent KilicAFPGetty We are fortunate in Europe in the sense that we haven’t had a major military conflict since the collapse of Yugoslavia and the Bosnian-Serb conflict of the 1990s. Maybe we are also fortunate that the refugee crisis is making us aware of wars elsewhere and the need for conciliation and mutual respect.But there are invisible wars continuing: wars of attrition, wars of diplomacy, economic wars which don’t need bombs, gas masks or even verbal abuse but which thrive on factors which are just as insidious as ethnic cleansing, terrorism and religious prejudice.Turkey may not officially be at war, but the narrow victory of President Recip Erdogan in last month’s elections will certainly increase the levels of aggression on which he, as executive president, will be able to operate. At home, Erdogan has not only effectively declared war on the opposition (imprisoning dissident academics, teachers and journalists) but makes no secret of his determination to suppress, if not exterminate, the Kurdish minority.Greece is watching Erdogan’s success with apprehension. He has already carried his arguments into the enemy camp during his state visit here last December when he spoke of rescinding the international treaties under which the Dodecanese islands (including Rhodes, Kos and Patmos) became part of Greece in 1947.Twice in the past 30 years, Greece and Turkey have been on the brink of war over the ownership of such islands. And Erdogan has indicated that he regards the citizens of northeastern Greece, who happen to be Muslim, as more properly part of his own Islamic hegemony.Wars therefore do not require military violence to become acts of hostility. Turkish warplanes provocatively entering Greek airspace are a tragedy waiting to happen and could precipitate a territorial conflict.And wars are not always fought for their ostensible reasons. The Greek war of independence was more about weakening the Ottoman empire (the “sick man of Europe”) than about freedom for Greeks. Turkey was a threat to the Austro-Hungarian empire because it controlled most of the Balkan region including the lands that are modern Greece. The states of Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Macedonia came into existence as and when it suited the Great Powers to create them.The “war” of the Grexit, when it looked as if Greece would leave the euro zone and revert to the drachma, wasn’t about saving the Greek economy (which was almost “dead in the Med” anyway) but about safeguarding the euro itself and the German and French banks which had over-lent to Greece.It was about saving the architects of the euro zone from a horrendous own goal. The destruction of the Greek economy and the near-collapse of the Italian, Spanish, Irish and Portuguese exchequers were the result of war-by-banking and war-by-chicanery.The “war” of the refugee crisis is being fought not so much to protect the Syrians and Afghans but to test Europe’s capacity for humanitarian compassion against its equal and opposite capacity to repel what it does not understand. Syria’s internal war, the ubiquitous Islamic State and the Middle East conflicts are challenging Europe’s conscience by fuelling its fears.The next “war”, to protect Europe from itself, will be fought not to respect the democratic rights of Italians, Greeks, Catalans or Basques but to copperfasten the hegemony of the northern states.The situation in Turkey, with a virtual dictatorship sitting on Europe’s doorstep, must make both the European centrists and expansionists fearful for the alleged ideals of the European founders: democracy, justice, free trade and movement of peoples and ideas, all of which are challenged by Greece’s nearest and most aggressive neighbour, Turkey.Erdogan’s slim 52 per cent majority will probably enlarge, rather than diminish, his single-minded aggressiveness, since he still has much to fear at home. Although he has made many Turks more prosperous and has a strong domestic economy, his politics are scaring away the chance of capital investment.Nevertheless, bankers lend to strong men, not to wimps. Meanwhile he can afford, literally, to condescend to Greece, where the average worker pays well over 50 per cent of income in taxes – direct, indirect and social security – and the prospects of economic recovery at a national level remain remote.Turkey is outside the EU and is likely to stay there. But its virtual dictatorship mirrors the would-be dictatorships within the EU of Viktor Orban’s Hungary and Jaroslaw Kaczynski’s Poland. As President Michael D Higgins emphasised in Greece in February and again last month in Latvia, it is in the smaller countries that many of the answers to Europe’s problems may be found."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3554194.1530731302!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ni secretary silent on budget for policing border after brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNorthern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley: “I do not have executive powers.” Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGetty ImagesNorthern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley has declined to say if the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) will receive more money and personnel to police the Border after Brexit when she introduces a budget for the North next week. Ms Bradley told the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster that this week’s meeting of the British cabinet at Chequers would address issues that will help determine the nature of the challenges the PSNI will face after Britain leaves the EU.“The budget I’m taking through was put forward in March for the coming year,” she said. “In the normal course of business, spending bids come in and are considered. I’m not making any comment. They are still being considered and it would be inappropriate for me to say anything further.”Last week, PSNI chief constable George Hamilton told the committee that he felt orphaned by having nobody in government to liaise with over Brexit. But Ms Bradley said she had arranged for Mr Hamilton to have points of contact in the Treasury and the Department for Exiting the European Union to deal with his concerns.“We accept the PSNI has additional difficulties over other forces the PSNI is the only force that will have to police a land border – a unique situation in the UK,” she said.“Our role as Northern Ireland office is that we are a liaison and co-ordination department to enable the requests and the concerns the Chief Constable has raised are dealt with accordingly. I want to be clear: I do not have executive powers, I cannot direct civil service, and I don’t have a budget.”The committee heard that paying the salaries of members of the Northern Ireland Assembly had cost £9 million since the body was suspended 18 months ago.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Weaver, a regular soldier, Private A.D. Maile, a National Serviceman thought to have joined in June or July 1949, and Private W. Philpot, who was wounded and captured and never seen again.“It has been a long time since these men went missing and I expect it will be difficult to identify them after all these years, but everything should be done to confirm their identities and give them the burial they deserve”, said Sam Mercer, who was a private with the Gloucester Regiment - the “Glorious Glosters” - and was captured in the infamous Battle of the Imjin River in April 1951.In the encounter, some 650 men of the regiment defied an estimated 10,000 Chinese troops to hold a key position and blunt an attack that would have overwhelmed Seoul and turned the tide in favour of the Chinese-North Korean alliance.“We had a job to do and I think we did it rather well, giving the Chinese a bloody nose in the process”, said Mr Mercer, 88, who now lives in Streatham, South London.Sam Mercer MBE, 88, served as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Gloucestershire Regiment Injured in the early stages of the battle, Mr Mercer lost an eye and was among hundreds who could not be evacuated and went into captivity.And because he was unable to move fast enough, a Chinese soldier shot him in the leg.Mr Mercer puts his survival during two years in a North Korean POW camp down to “a combination of determination, bloody-mindedness and a large slice of lady luck” - but he knows of at least two British POWs who died in captivity and were interred in the North.“A lot of time has elapsed, but they should be brought home”, he said.According to Frank Fallows, the chairman of the British Korean War Veterans Association, a total of 336 British military personnel are still listed as missing.Of that number, 50 were members of the Royal Navy or merchant navy and are considered lost at sea. The remaining 286 were with regular British Army regiments, the Royal Marines or Royal Air Force.Some 1,108 British troops died in the Korean War and 106 spent time in POW camps in North Korea.Edgar Green, who served as a private in the Middlesex Regiment, believes it is very possible that British troops may have been mistaken for US personnel.The truce village at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) which separates the two Koreas“We arrived in Busan from Hong Kong August 1950 wearing our tropical kit, but a few months later it was well below freezing and we were issued with American cold-weather equipment”, he told The . “I know of at least two Middlesex Regiment men who were captured and assumed to be Americans because of the clothes they were wearing. Both of them were very badly treated and died in POW camps.”Mr Green, 87 and now living in Aldermaston in Berkshire, firmly believes that the remains of British soldiers should be returned from the North and, if they cannot be repatriated to the UK, then they should be interred with the vast majority of other British casualties of the conflict at the United Nations Military Cemetery in Busan.A total of 885 British personnel are already buried at the cemetery.“I may be old, but I would go to any funeral for a British soldier that they return”. Mr Green said.“I cannot begin to explain the sense of camaraderie that we had then and still have today”, he added.Please review our commenting policyBarry Davies: The Man, The Voice, The Legend, review – a commentator who was magnificently on the ballSalisbury couple are fresh victims of the Novichok attack on Sergei and Yulia SkripalBrexit \u0026#39third way\u0026#39 is unworkable, says David Davis in last-ditch letter to Theresa May ahead of crunch talks Alesha MacPhail: Scottish island on \u0026#39lockdown\u0026#39 as tight-knit community is rocked by murder Duty of Care: Church of England attacks \u0026#39irresponsible\u0026#39 social media companies amid claims of children being harmed Church of England warns wedding guests not to check mobile phones during World Cup match on Saturday Macron says migrant centres will only work if African nations take lead as EU immigration crisis deepensNavy seals teach Thai boys how to e ahead of dangerous cave extractionSecond hospital investigating nurse Lucy Letby after arrest on suspicion of murdering eight babiesIsle of Bute murder: Male aged under 18 is arrested after girl, 6, found deadAlan Dershowitz claims former friends are \u0026#39shunning\u0026#39 him for his defence of Donald Trump Mexico\u0026#39s new president shuns security detail, saying \u0026#39the people will protect me\u0026#39Comment: Fear of offending women is out of control.

The vote for Brexit was a cry for greater opportunity from those who feel that they and their children are mired in lives that offer little hope. \u0026nbspBrexit is a done deal, and the exact parameters of exit from the European Union will have limited and short-term bearing on the UK’s economic performance.The basic facts are uncontroversial. Britain will trade somewhat less than before, at least until British businesses redirect some of their trade away from the EU to more dynamic Asian and US economies.The expected decline in the extent of international trade will, for a while, reduce Britain’s overall economic welfare. But, as the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik has repeatedly emphasized, citizens’ economic welfare changes only modestly when countries with extensive trade relationships increase or decrease the extent of their international trade.Estimates of large (sometimes very large) costs of Brexit rely on the wildly unreasonable assumption that British productivity will decline precipitously and permanently.True, the UK\u0026nbsphas been growing slower than other advanced economies since the Brexit vote but that slower growth is almost entirely explained by senseless fiscal austerity being pursued by Prime Minister Theresa May’s government while other countries have neutral or even expansionary fiscal policy.There has been much handwringing about the depreciation of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote. Currency depreciation normally makes citizens poorer: they pay more for foreign products and receive reduced prices for their exports. But the UK was running a large (and growing) current account deficit.Put simply, the UK was not richer it was living beyond its means. Prolonged current account deficits would eventually have caused a sharper and, therefore, potentially more disruptive exchange rate depreciation. For now, the depreciation has helped narrow the deficit (precisely by making British exports less expensive for trading partners – stimulating demand for British goods – and making imports dearer for British consumers). Britain is on a more sustainable growth path.Moreover, as I noted at the time, the pound’s depreciation reflected an abrupt decline in “hot money flows” into the UK\u0026nbspThese foreign funds were being used by Russian oligarchs and Indian billionaires to bid up prices of property in London. After the Brexit decision, the rate of rise in London property price increases slowed markedly recently prices have actually dropped.Since the modest trade costs of Brexit are at least partially offset by favourable developments, it is crucial to recognise what is really at stake. The Brexit vote expressed the anxiety of those who felt that their prospects of rising up the income ladder were vanishing. In her October 2016 address to the Tory party conference in Birmingham, Theresa May seemed to understand that the vote was a plea for greater opportunity and fairness. But she seems to have lost track of that insight.As my student Rachel Lurie and I find in ongoing research, those who voted against Brexit were predominantly low-skilled workers stuck in dead-end jobs or unemployed in Britain’s rust-belt areas. As former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the days after the Brexit referendum, unable to face Asian competition, British manufacturing “collapsed,” and industrial towns “hollowed out,” leaving semi-skilled workers “on the wrong side of globalisation.”But rust-belt parents had a deeper reason to worry. They were bequeathing poor education and work opportunities to their children. Thus, not only were they themselves stuck, they also felt powerless to create more opportunities for their children and grandchildren.The children, for their part, are as dispirited as their parents. Commentators commonly point out that young British citizens voted more so than their elders to remain in the EU. This ignores the large numbers who did not vote: these were young citizens typically unemployed in socially dysfunctional urban communities.For example, in Greater London, the voter turnout was 79 percent in affluent Kingston upon Thames borough but only 65 percent in Hackney, where large pockets of deep poverty and alienation persist. The non-vote of the young living in bleak urban areas was as much a sign of hopelessness as the exit vote of older rust-belt citizens.Theresa May’s early reading was right: UK\u0026nbspcitizens were indeed pleading through their vote (and non-vote) for a fair shot at the future. They were urgently calling on British leaders to revitalize decaying industrial areas and bring hope to failing urban communities in which they were trapped.The message of the Brexit vote – and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since – was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitments.That crucial message has been lost amid the frenzied Brexit negotiations. Until it is heard, it will continue to haunt, and be repeated again and again.Ashoka Mody\u0026nbspis Visiting Professor of International Economic Policy at Princeton University and former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund’s European and Research Departments.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That means for instance that an apple and a cannonball, falling from a tower, will reach the ground at the same time.But some worried that might not always be true. In cases of extreme gravity, it was thought, alternative kinds of gravitational behaviour might be observed.By testing the theory in perhaps the most extreme environment possible – in a massive three-star system – the theory still applies.This research shows how routine and careful observation of distant stars can give us a high-precision test of one of the fundamental theories of physics, said Ingrid Stairs, professor in the department of physics and astronomy at UBC and a co-author of the study.The research was done in what scientists referred to as a natural laboratory –\u0026nbspa triple star system called PSR J0337+1715, located about 4,200 light-years from Earth. The extreme conditions there serve as a useful way for scientists to perform tests in such situations.This is a unique star system, said Ryan Lynch of the Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia, and coauthor on the paper. We don\u0027t know of any others quite like it. That makes it a one-of-a-kind laboratory for putting Einstein\u0027s theories to the test.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

Scientists have been watching the system for years, and the neutron star sends out an incredibly reliable pulse that means it can be tracked with extreme precision.If other theories of gravity were correct, then the neutron star and the inner white dwarf would fall towards the outer white dwarf differently to each other. Since the inner white dwarf is not as massive or compact as the neutron star, if the theories gravitational binding energy had an effect then it would be possible to see it from Earth.The researchers didn\u0027t see any effect, suggesting that Einstein\u0027s theory of relativity holds true even at such vast scales.\u0026nbspIf there is a difference, it is no more than three parts in a million, said coauthor Nina Gusinskaia of the University of Amsterdam.Theory of relativityEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

blacklist communists information research department ird","story":"Created with Sketch.In 1949 the man who conceived Big Brother gave a semi-secret government department a list of 38 ‘crypto-communists’\u0026nbspand ‘fellow travellers’ –\u0026nbspa revelation that has given rise to a peculiar revisionism of his legacyClick to followThe Independent OnlineGeorge Orwell’s cooperation with the government’s Information Research Department has led to some on the hard left branding him a ‘reactionary snitch’To many, he came close to being a secular saint.George Orwell, born 115 years ago on Monday, was the writer who challenged the iniquities of imperialism and capitalism, who took a bullet in the throat fighting fascism, and who taught a Western audience about the horrors of Stalinist communism.That he died young, of tuberculosis at the age of 46, in 1950, served only to enhance his posthumous reputation.\u0026nbspHe became, in the words of one astute critic, “the James Dean of the Cold War,\u0026nbspthe John F\u0026nbspKennedy of English letters”.Death may also have saved him from curdling into the kind of bitter, contrarian conservatism that seems to have been the fate awaiting many a one-time youthful socialist.Instead, Orwell is often remembered as a man of “genius”, the “greatest political writer of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury”.The commonly accepted view of the man is encapsulated in the aims of the foundation bearing his name.\u0026nbspThrough the coveted Orwell Prize, the Orwell Foundation seeks “to celebrate honest writing and reporting, to uncover hidden lives, to confront uncomfortable truths, to promote Orwell’s values of integrity, decency and fidelity to truth”.And yet there is one blemish – or complication – in the reputation of St George.It lay hidden until 1996 when Foreign Office file FO 111189 was made public under the 30-year rule.The hitherto secret file revealed that in 1949 the great writer had, via his friend Celia Kirwan, given a semi-secret government propaganda unit called the Information Research Department\u0026nbsp(IRD) what became known as “Orwell’s List”.Orwell effectively handed over to the British authorities the names of 38 public figures whom he thought should be treated with suspicion as secret communists or “fellow travellers” who sympathised with the aims of Stalin’s Russia.When the existence of Orwell’s List was revealed in 1996, and when the Foreign Office finally ulged who was on it in 2003, the initial reactions seemed tinged with sadness and hedged about with qualifications.But the internet was young then.Now it has grown into a giant bristling with social media channels and anger\u0026nbspswift to judge, slow to reflect.And so George Orwell, a hero to so many, is now demonised online as a “fake socialist”, a “reactionary snitch”, a traitor, a McCarthyite “weasel”.“Orwell’s List is a term that should be known by anyone who claims to be a person of the left,” declares one fairly widely circulated condemnation.\u0026nbsp“At the end of his life, he was an outright counter-revolutionary snitch, spying on leftists on behalf of the imperialist British government.”“He was an anti-socialist,” asserts another indictment, “corresponding with British secret services and keeping a blacklist of writers.”So widespread has the vilification become,\u0026nbspthat “Orwell as snitch”\u0026nbspis sometimes played with – not entirely seriously – as an internet meme.“I can’t get very worked up about the list,” he says mildly.\u0026nbsp“I don’t see it particularly as a mistake. \u0026nbsp“You just have to see it in the context of the time.”And that context, reveals Taylor, was explained to him by the left wing former Labour leader Michael Foot.Taylor recalls: “Foot told me that the great difficulty if you were a left wing Labour MP in the 1940s was working out exactly where your friends stood.\u0026nbspYou didn’t know whether some were listening to you and agreeing, and then going straight to the British Communist Party’s headquarters in King Street and telling them everything.”“Another example of the kind of thing they were facing,” says Taylor, “was the man who worked in the Foreign Office in the room next to Orwell’s IRD friend Celia.\u0026nbspHis name was Guy Burgess.“There were at least a dozen elected parliamentarians taking their orders from a foreign country,” adds Taylor.\u0026nbsp“What could be more traitorous than that?”Years after Orwell listed him as giving the “strong impression of being some kind of Russian agent”, the Mitrokhin Archive of KGB documents revealed that journalist Peter Smollett had indeed been a Russian agent.Driberg, who was\u0026nbspnamed on Orwell’s List as well as the KGB papers (Getty)Also listed by Orwell, and as a KGB agent by Mitrokhin, was the leading Labour MP Tom Driberg.Laying aside the irony that Michael Foot was himself once falsely accused of being a KGB agent, it is, then, perhaps no coincidence that the IRD was in fact set up, not by a headbanging Tory, but by Labour foreign secretary Ernest Bevin.“This was at a time when the Soviet Union was swallowing up what had previously been independent East European states,” says Taylor. “The IRD was producing reasoned expositions, pamphlet literature, telling people on the ground in Eastern Europe why they should resist this kind of stuff. \u0026nbsp“But a lot of British people were still seduced by the idea of our ally ‘good old Uncle Joe Stalin’, when in fact the bloke was a mass murdering psychopath.\u0026nbspAnd you were also dealing with some really hardline ideologues.“So Orwell’s idea was, if you are going to get somebody to write these kinds of pamphlets, they have to be genuine democrats.“He was a democratic socialist who wanted democratic socialists, not right wingers, to be writing this propaganda.\u0026nbspBut he wanted them to be people who had seen through the Soviet illusion, not covert stooges for Stalin’s Russia.”And so Taylor’s anger – such as it is – is reserved, not for Orwell, but for those like the late Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, who greeted the revelation of the list with the “pathetic” remark: “Orwell was a Big Brother too”.“This wasn’t Orwell denouncing anybody,” says Taylor.\u0026nbsp“He wasn’t writing public articles in the press saying ‘these people are evil’.It should perhaps be noted that Celia Kirwan was a bit more than just a friend.\u0026nbspThree years earlier, Orwell had actually proposed marriage to her in the emotional turmoil that followed the death of his first wife Eileen.Kirwan rebuffed his advances, but some have suggested that Orwell, aware of his failing health, might have been seeking the comfort of a beautiful woman when\u0026nbspon 6 April 1949\u0026nbsphe wrote offering to name those who “should not be trusted as propagandists”. \u0026nbspHe certainly knew the list was not for Kirwan’s eyes only.\u0026nbspAs noted by Timothy Garton Ash, the historian who persuaded the Foreign Office to reveal the document in 2003, Orwell sent his list to Kirwan with a reference to “your friends” who would read it.And as Garton Ash also noted, the IRD did not confine itself to relatively innocuous pamphleteering.In the New York Review of Books article that formed the first detailed analysis of the list’s contents, Garton Ash wrote: “By the late 1950s, IRD had a reputation as ‘the dirty tricks department’ of the Foreign Office, indulging in character assassination, false telegrams, putting itching powder on lavatory seats\u0026nbspand other such Cold War pranks”.When he sent his list to Celia Kirwan in 1949, Orwell might not have known that this was the IRD’s direction of travel, but of all people, the author of 1984, who envisaged the Ministry of Truth, should surely have been aware of the possibility.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThat said, as Garton Ash also wrote, not much seemed to have happened to the people on Orwell’s List (apart from missing out on the IRD pamphlet-writing gig).\u0026nbspIt seems their names weren’t even passed to MI5 or MI6.In America, Hollywood actors blacklisted during the McCarthy era\u0026nbsphad their careers and lives ruined.\u0026nbspIn England, Michael Redgrave appeared on Orwell’s List in 1949 and starred in the film adaptation of Orwell’s novel 1984 seven years later.Peter Smollett, named by Orwell as a likely Russian agent, got an OBE.2017 isn’t ‘1984’ – it’s stranger than Orwell imaginedREAR WINDOW: COLD WAR:The British Ministry of PropagandaBig Brother with a high moral senseIn other words, what happened to those on Orwell’s List seems to have borne no comparison to the fate of Big Brother’s fictional victims or the real millions who died in the purges and repression ordered by Stalin.“The list invites us to reflect again on the asymmetry of our attitudes toward\u0026nbspNazism and communism,” wrote Garton Ash, whose own experiences of being spied on by the communist East German Stasi informed his book The File. \u0026nbspWhat if Orwell had given the government a list of closet Nazis, he wondered.\u0026nbsp“Would anyone be objecting?”And in truth, there does seem a certain asymmetry in the online articles of denunciation.Indeed it is hard not to sense the inspiration of Private Eye’s (fictional) veteran class warrior Dave Spart in some of the articles condemning Orwell as “a social democratic traitor collaborating with the capitalist state against revolutionaries trying to create socialism.”“Sure, the USSR did a lot of objectionable things,” says one writer.\u0026nbsp“But … Western imperialist countries commit much more heinous crimes throughout the world every day.”Which is one way to gloss over the Gulag.The 15 best opening lines in literature115 Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen“It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a

The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.A stronger charge against Orwell might be that of antisemitism.\u0026nbspThe private notebooks that formed the basis of the list he sent to the IRD included labels like “Polish Jew”, “English Jew”, and “Jewess”.But Orwell did also devote an entire 1945 essay to discussing how best to combat antisemitism, while having the honesty to admit – and regret – his own occasional lapses into jokes at the expense of Jews.And at the moment, antisemitism might be a problematic charge for some left wingers to level.Taylor, though, is convinced that some amongst “the newly emergent hard left” would secretly love to unleash something against Orwell.And yes, by “newly emergent hard left”, he does mean some Corbynistas.Younger party members, Taylor concedes, might not have the personal memories of the Cold War, still less an instinctive understanding of the context in which Orwell produced his list in 1949.But, he adds: “I am a Labour Party member.\u0026nbspI have been to hear Corbyn speak and noticed how an awful lot of the people there were aged left wingers for whom there had not really been a place in the Labour Party for the last 20 or 30 years.“An awful lot of the hard left these days would pay lip service to Orwell as a beacon of sanity, while secretly having doubts.“There are still a load of extreme lefties out there to whom Orwell is this snivelling little Trotskyite telling them things they don’t want to hear and pointing out things that shouldn’t be pointed out because they get in the way of the revolution.”And to the ideological, Taylor would add the psychological: “Tall poppy syndrome – Orwell is this secular saint, so let’s have a go at him.”This battle over Orwell’s reputation, of course, is more than just a matter of idle literary historical curiosity.Its relevance to the political struggles of today is suggested by the remark of one of the more ferocious online critics.“George Orwell,” he says, “was the first in a long line of Trots-turned-neocons”.It is certainly true that far-right commentators have started trying to co-opt Orwell to their cause, even to the point of suggesting that the man who once chased a fascist across a battlefield with a fixed bayonet would deplore the Antifa movement.This, says Taylor, is pretty much what Orwell feared.“At the time he was giving Celia Kirwan his list, 1984 was about to be published.\u0026nbspOrwell’s great fear was that right wingers would use it as a piece of anti-communist propaganda, and that’s what happened.\u0026nbspImmediately after\u0026nbsp1984 was published, it was used by the CIA as a propaganda tool.“Orwell wrote a very interesting letter to people in the US saying: ‘Look, this is not so much anti-communist as anti-totalitarian.’“He feared what right wingers would do with 1984, but thought it was the price you had to pay for exposing evils like totalitarianism.“And a writer can’t be blamed for how their books are used by people who are determined to twist meaning for malignant ends.”Taylor, though, can’t help wondering whether Orwell would really have been that upset by the comments of “slightly disconnected people” on the far left of the internet.Orwell himself, he points out, never sought secular saint status.\u0026nbspQuite the reverse: “He was very wary of that kind of thing.\u0026nbspIn an essay on Gandhi he effectively says that when people start being referred to as saints there is something very odd about them and it usually ends in disaster.”Instead Taylor has a sneaking suspicion that Orwell might have been rather amused by his online detractors.“People undervalue Orwell’s wry sense of humour,” he says.\u0026nbsp“David Astor, who used to edit the Observer and employed him, told me about the time Orwell came to him saying, ‘You should hear the abuse I have been getting from some of the communist newspapers.’“Orwell said: ‘They call me a fascist octopus.\u0026nbspThey call me a fascist hyena.“Then he paused: ‘They’re very fond of animals’.”\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

From 2012-13 to 2017-18, the total was £94.24m.The calculation of the total surplus generated does not include the profit made on unsuccessful registration applications by children.The Home Office argues the revenue contributes\u0026nbsptowards the wider costs involved in running the UK’s\u0026nbspborder, immigration and citizenship system, saying the service should be “funded by those who benefit from it”.But a significant fall in registrations over the five year period suggests\u0026nbsphigh fees are preventing children from obtaining citizenship, which can restrict them from doing basic things including travelling abroad and attending\u0026nbspcollege or university.\u0026nbspNot being able to register as British can also mean children are at risk of being detained and removed from the UK, including in circumstances where the Home Office is aware\u0026nbspthey are entitled to register as British if they could afford the fee.Colin Yeo, who carried out the analysis, told The Independent: “It is impossible to justify making a profit from children when they are by law supposed to be entitled to citizenship.\u0026nbsp“Fears that some children will lose out on citizenship because of the high fees are borne out by a significant fall in registrations over the same period that fees have more than doubled.”Unlike in most European countries, children who are born in Britain but whose parents were not formally settled in the country at the time of their birth, are not considered British.\u0026nbspDaniel, a 15-year-old who has been in the UK since the age of three, was prevented from going on school trips and risks missing out on college because his mother could not afford to apply for citizenship.He told The Independent: “It’s stopped me doing a lot of things. I felt like I was different from everyone else. You’d think me being British would be something that would come naturally, as I’ve been here as long as I can remember. It’s been really limiting.”Amnesty International UK and the Project for the Registration of Children as British Citizens (PRCBC), who are seeking a judicial review, said the charges were “utterly shameful”.Solange Valdez-Symonds, director at PRCBC, said: “An estimated 120,000 children in the UK who have grown up British are being charged unaffordable fees to register their citizenship rights.“The futures of these children are slowly and silently being chipped away. Such barefaced profiteering from children by the Home Office is utterly shameful.“No child should be denied their right to British citizenship because of a profit-making fee they cannot afford.”UK news in picturesBritish police officers stand facing a residential property in Amesbury, England, Wednesday, July 4, 2018.

What I meant to say was that the NAO had said that there was no practical alternative to continuing with universal credit.”In his letter Sir Amyas said it was “odd” that Ms McVey told MPs that the NAO did not take into account recent changes in the administration of universal credit, when the report had in fact been “fully agreed” with senior officials at the Department for Work and Pensions only days earlier.He added that Ms McVey’s claim that the NAO was concerned that universal credit was rolling out too slowly was “not correct”.UK news in picturesBritish police officers stand facing a residential property in Amesbury, England, Wednesday, July 4, 2018.

The Central Bank of Venezuela, which did not immediately respond to request for comment, has not independently released inflation figures in at least a year.\u0026nbspVenezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, has passed blame for the roiled economy onto others, including opposition activists and officials in Washington. At a campaign rally in May, he blamed hyperinflation on criminal mafias.But economists point out that Mr Maduro runs the unorthodox policies they say have pushed the country into economic crisis. The socialist leader has repeatedly refused international aid to Venezuela.It\u0027s internal, Professor Hanke said. Government spending continues to accelerate and the sources of revenue start drying up.The government has defaulted on a majority of their outstanding bonds, which economists estimate add up to about $60 billion (£45 million). Foreign exchange reserves have fallen by about $2.5 billion ($1.9 million) in the last three months, according to analysis by Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAs state-run oil industry PDVSA falls apart, economists say a rise in global oil prices is adding to the pain. Brent crude oil is up more than 64 percent this year. And as President Donald Trump cracks down on Iran via zero-tolerance oil sanctions, the international benchmark has rallied more than 8 percent\u0026nbspthis week.Production at PDVSA\u0026nbsp- which accounts for 95 percent of export earnings in the country and a quarter of gross domestic product - was cut in half from January 2016 to January 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. And as the crisis deepens, operations are continuing to wane.Those conditions, Professor Hanke said, have all but killed investor sentiment.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s an expectation part of it, too, Professor Hanke added. Everyone who has a bolivar wants to get rid of it like a hot potato because they expect it\u0027s not going to be worth anything tomorrow.The International Monetary Fund estimated in January that Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate could rise as high as 13,000 percent for all of 2018. Professor Hanke was unsurprised by the discrepancy, saying no one can accurately forecast the course or the duration of a hyperinflation.In pictures: The crisis in VenezuelaA girl scavanges for food in the streets of CaracasA man scavenges for food next to girls in the streets of Caracas.

A recent university study found that about 90 percent of civilians were living in poverty last year and most of those surveyed had lost an average of 25 pounds in body weight.\u0026nbspThe hyperinflation is devastating the economy, said Andres Abadia, a senior economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He expects the economy to contract in 2018, for a fifth consecutive year, and sees no turnaround in the near-term.Mr Abadia said Venezuela is a disaster area and that as long as Mr Maduro is in power, the economy will continue to collapse. But Mr Maduro reaffirmed his\u0026nbsptight grip on power last month, easily winning\u0026nbspanother six-year term in what was widely condemned as a fraudulent election.\u0026nbspMr Maduro tripled wages earlier in June to 3 million bolivars per month, which Reuters reported at the time was equal to just more than a dollar at the black-market exchange rate.When asked if the wage increase might improve living conditions in Venezuela, Professor Hanke replied: No, it\u0027s a joke.

Perhaps some isolated thundery showers in places. Probably cloudier and cooler in the north west Thursday.The World Meteorological Organisation definition of a heatwave is when the daily maximum temperature of more than five consecutive days exceeds the average maximum temperature by 5C, the normal period being 1961-1990.They are most common in summer when high pressure develops across an area.High-pressure systems are slow moving and can persist over an area for a prolonged period of time such as days or weeks.They can occur in the UK due to the location of the jet stream, which is usually to the north of the UK in the summer.This can allow high pressure to develop over the UK resulting in persistent dry and settled weather.The scorching summer of 1976 was the hottest summer since records began.It led to a severe drought owing to the exceptionally dry conditions, although it is thought that 1995 was drier.In the summer of 1976, Heathrow had 16 consecutive days over 30C from June 23 to July 8, and for 15 consecutive days from June 23 to July 7 temperatures reached 32.2C somewhere in England.But the single hottest temperature of 38.5C was set on August 10, 2003.When the mercury shoots up there are several obvious precautions to take.It is advised to make sure you drink a lot of water to make sure you stay hydrated during the hot spell.Keeping a bottle of sunscreen with you to soak up those UV rays is also highly advisable as is ensuring you have a hat to prevent sunstroke."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/unnamed-9.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"So if youre after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further.Sign up to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun 10 - Receive the 10 biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-life stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TV\u0026ampShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.

It is far more exposed than any other EU country, or the UK.Our billions bailed out broke Ireland in 2010. Has Varadkar forgotten?Is he happy to sour relations with millions of UK customers with long memories, who may take against Irish goods?A wiser man would have acted as peacemaker, constructively helping both sides forge a historic deal in all our interests, including those of his country and its wonderful people.Instead he chose another role . . . as the snivelling suck-up egging on the playground bullies.THERESA May must seize her crucial opportunity to save Nato next month.Donald Trump is rightly berating Europe’s major powers for failing, unlike Britain, to fund their defence.

They must also achieve an outcome which allows the UK to take back full control over our laws, our borders and our money.Any wavering or compromise that keeps Britain as a cash cow for Europe, and our people and businesses subjugated to EU laws that hurt our interests, would be a spectacular own goal.Instead of pandering to those who want to keep Britain in the EU, the Single Market and Customs Union, the team at Chequers must now stand firm and not back down.Their strategy and game plan must be to stand up to the EU and stop letting their negotiating team walk all over us.So far we have been negotiating with the EU in good faith and we have conceded too much ground for little in return.We have pledged a divorce settlement totalling £40billion and while we have advanced a package to ensure that the rights of EU citizens currently in the UK are protected, the rest of the EU have made alarmingly little progress on protecting the rights of British citizens living elsewhere in the EU.Conceding further ground to the EU now will leave Britain exposed at the back and will let the greedy undemocratic EU leaders take advantage of our open goal.The country also decided to take Britain on a new path to future prosperity.Outside of the EU the world is growing at a fast pace.Expanding consumer markets present new opportunities for exciting trade and investment partnerships. Technological change and innovation happens worldwide and the EU’s place in the global economy is falling fast.Ministers must not allow Britain to slip in the world trade league by being chained in any way to Brussels as the EU sinks.Without the straitjacket of EU rules Britain will stand out as a strong place for businesses to invest.While an out-of-touch elite who want to keep Britain in the EU continue to spread fear and doom and gloom, in the real world our economy is doing well.We have some great foundations and since the referendum Britain has seen a surge in foreign direct investment to record levels which shows the high degree of confidence investors have in Britain.They see that outside of the EU Britain will be successful and everyone in the Cabinet should stop playing defensively and commit to that vision too.We are at a crucial moment in our history and Cabinet members need to understand the magnitude of the decisions   they are making.Now is not the time for grandstanding or for egos to get in the way. Ministers need to tighten ranks and play as a united team to achieve victory.The future of our country is far too important to leave to chance and if the Cabinet gets its act together this week then we will be in control of our own destiny.In years to come, people will look back at the decisions we make today and judge members of this Government on whether they have advanced the cause of freedom, prosperity and democracy with a well-executed match- winning plan . . . or left our country to the fate and uncertainty of a penalty shoot-out.Priti Patel is a Conservative MP, representing  Witham in Essex. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Way better, in fact, without wanting to sling mud, than many other commentators who — regardless of their gender — can barely string two words together.Because, of course, whether or not you are good at your job has got absolutely nothing to do with your gender, right?Until, that is, you are a woman in football, or some other realm that men consider belongs to them.Then, it turns out, it’s a problem. For some men at least.Just to be clear, the idea that football is a “guy thing” is totally outdated. More women watch football in the UK than watch EastEnders (and that’s when there isn’t a World Cup on).And that’s just watching it. I’ll get on to playing it in a minute.Still, Simon Kelner, the former editor of the Independent, wrote in a column this week that women talking about World Cup games “is like getting a netball player to discuss major league basketball”.Then former player Jason Cundy gave his five cents worth, saying that women are unsuited to commentate on football matches because “their voices are too high”.And — although I had to watch it from behind a cushion because I was cringing so much — former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra gave Eni Aluko an actual round of applause for her analysis of one match. . . because he was so surprised that women, you know, know stuff about football too.(Her face when he did so was priceless: Withering look personified.)In case you didn’t know, Eni Aluko has more than 100 caps for England as a player. She also has a first-class degree in law. She is super brainy, bright and articulate — and she knows an awful lot about football.I am full of admiration for her. She is such a strong woman. She is also more than qualified to comment on a football match.Sadly, “more than qualified” is often what women need to be to get ahead in a male world.Eni Aluko is a high-powered lawyer, a professional sportswoman who adds serious value to the commentary of any match.Patrice Evra must know her credentials. But some men, when they feel threatened by a woman, respond by patronising her. They try to put her down. Diminish her. Banish her back into her box.As a woman working in sport I am familiar with this.Lots of men who think women in football are encroaching on “their” territory do the same to me. The number of suggestions I’ve had to get back in the kitchen — and far worse — are too many to count.It doesn’t bother me. But it is tedious and annoying.Men who respond to women in this way can’t quite accept that a new generation of women are coming to the fore and using their voice.They really can’t get their heads around the changes that are happening so quickly — the emergence of women who are using their voice, taking “their” jobs.Luckily, they are a dying breed, these men who want to keep women in the Victorian ages.Plus, it is beginning to dawn on them that we aren’t going back into the box.And they’d better get used to it because it’s not just women commentating on football who are being taken more seriously. It’s women who are playing it too.I’m proud and excited to say that West Ham is one of 11 clubs with new Women’s Super League licences.This really is going to change the face of women’s football.Tier one, the Women’s Super League, starts next year and West Ham is part of that.And the Super League is going to mean a lot more money, professionalism and structure for women in football.So to anyone who is worried about female match commentators all I can say is: Hold on to your hats, boys.REBEKAH Vardy got slammed this week for speaking out about being in Russia.She said that she took the role of supporting her husband – and being there for him before a match – very seriously, saying: “I would be mortified if I was pictured leaving a bar absolutely p***ed, knowing that my husband was going to play one of the biggest games of his life the next day.”Of course, some wasted no time laying into Rebekah’s version of feminism since it included being present for her husband which – according to comments I read – undermines feminist values.I have to say I really disagree.Whoever said that you can’t be a feminist and also stand by your man?I LOVED reading about Christine Lampard, who is pregnant, saying she, “couldn’t care less” about putting on weight as long as everything’s OK inside.In an age when many pregnant women barely look like they are expecting, only to “snap back into shape” within days of giving birth, that’s such a refreshing attitude.

Not Piers, who went on to issue a further challenge: “On Thursday night, you can watch England destroy Belgium, then watch me destroy Love Island straight after.”So I did. No further comment is needed on the first bit of Piers’ equation. But, hell on TV earth, I can’t ignore the second.A “one-off special” called Good Evening Britain which attempted to cash in on the breakfast magic and must have seemed like a great idea until England v Belgium became a loser-takes-all non-event, the wardrobe department shoved Susanna Reid into a Spanish Flamenco dancer’s outfit and someone lost control of the guest list.’Cos all of the pre-publicity for this one assured me there’d be just three present: Danny Dyer, the Labour Party leader and a slightly spooked Pamela Anderson, who set the first alarm ringing by claiming: “When they told me Jeremy Corbyn’s going to be here I thought this was going to be a serious political ­programme.”Why the hell a dissembling old fool like Corbyn would make anyone think that is a bit of a mystery, but ­serious was the last word you’d use to describe Good Evening Britain.They weren’t alone either. The joint was jumping, in fact, with David Ginola, Amir Khan, Ed Balls, Tory MP James Cleverly, Harry Redknapp, BGT comic Daliso Chaponda and live feeds from a reporter in Russia and Andi Peters at Emmerdale’s Woolpack pub.As GEB quickly demonstrated, of course, the reason chat shows don’t invite nine guests to appear is that you instantly have nine chaotic voices clamouring for attention and often talking at cross-purposes.All it then takes is one guest to throw a spanner in the works and the whole vibe collapses, as it duly did when Piers and Susanna started asking Pammie about her French footballer boyfriend, Adil Rami, who she claimed was “doing really well”.Susanna: “He’s not played yet.” I haven’t been watching, I’ve been looking after my father who’s just had a stroke.” When someone drops a bombshell like that, clearly, you need to steer the conversation away pretty sharpish which, in fairness, Piers did by asking Amir Khan: “Do you have a sex ban before fights?”Only with his wife, I’d imagine, Piers, but thanks for asking. It set the perfectly awkward tone for the entire evening. For GEB to be classed as a true TV disaster, though, it still needed three other things to happen.The first were technical glitches, which duly arrived when the satellite link to a bunch of drunk England fans went down. The second was Andi Peters referring to Emmerdale as “Coronation Street”. Check.The third and most important, however, was for one of the guests to get a bit sweary and lairy. Enter Danny Dyer who ensured GEB will enter TV folklore, when he launched into Brexit, asking: “What’s happened to that t**t David Cameron? He’s in Nice with his trotters up. He should be held to account for it . . . t**t.”The far more pertinent bit of his ­contribution, though, was the moment he addressed the host: “Just stop talking, Piers. Just talkin’ talkin’, ramblin’ on.”Breakfast TV would be a hopelessly dull, molly-coddling chore again without Piers’ ego and all his boastful predictions, which just for the record, ended with the following score, on Thursday.Good Evening Britain — 2.91million viewers. Love Island — 3.2million. Boom.Martin Keown: “When you play in midfield you’ve got to have legs.”Guy Mowbray: “We haven’t seen anything of Di Maria in Argentina’s first three games. Although he only played in two of them.”Alan Shearer: “Portugal were very much like Portugal.”And Lee Dixon: “We’ve had five balls that have gone flat. Three times that’s happened.”(Compiled by Graham Wray).WHATEVER our differences elsewhere, I hope there’s one thing on which we’re all agreed.The greatest quiz show in television history is Bullseye.An opinion confirmed when I tapped those magic eight letters into my Sky Planner’s search engine last week, and its back catalogue unfurled before me, including episode one of series one, which, for a TV critic, is like finding the source of the Nile.I don’t expect you to watch every episode, obviously, but if you have time for one, make it episode eight of series two. It’s as funny, heart-warming and brilliantly formatted as you remember. But the most remarkable thing is, hardly any of it would now be considered fit for broadcast.For not only is Jocky Wilson smoking a fag as he attempts the 301 or more challenge, Jim Bowen, can’t help drawing attention to a facial scar on a contestant’s face.“You’ve obviously had an accident, tell us how.” “I was 11 years old, it was a petrol can blew up on a building site.” “Lovely to be able to talk about that, smashing.”Broadsheet newspaper columnists, right-on comedians and other handbag-clasping s of the nation’s morals will, of course, say: “Well thank goodness we’ve moved on since then.” Which is precisely the reason none of them will ever create a show as beautiful as Bullseye or say anything remotely as funny as the bellowing climax to the prize board, on show eight.Bully’s special prize?“What every woman dreams of. A full-length Scandinavian mink coat.”RANDOM TV irritations: Jeremy Corbyn’s insanely annoying habit of giving a triumphant little sniff every time he thinks he’s made a good point.BBC presenters turning Aneurin Bevan into the L Ron Hubbard of their NHS cult. News ­reporters describing everything that’s happened quite a lot as being: “On an industrial scale.”Over-familiar BBC continuity announcers suddenly greeting me with a: “Hi, I’m Russell.” (Don’t care.) And a bite massage therapist from Hollywood called Doctor Dot failing to provide the necessary health and safety warning before she told This Morning’s Eamonn Holmes: “Ruth’s going to be biting you tonight.”’Cos she’d have bitten off more than she could chew if she did.The Chase USA, Brooke Burns: “Alphabetically, what day of the week comes first?” Andy: “Tuesday.”The Chase Australia, Andrew O’Keefe: “In which decade of the 19th Century was the Crimean War fought?”Simon: “The 1950s.”Andrew O’Keefe: “TV series Twin Peaks is set in which fictional town?”Dan: “Transylvania.”“No, Twin Peaks.” NHS cultists gathered last week to applaud, grovel, sing, dance and grin like madmen in its honour.I exaggerate a bit, obviously. The singing and dancing doesn’t begin until tomorrow night on ITV.It was still an unsettling experience though, watching BBC2’s NHS At 70: Live, from The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in Birmingham, hosted by Anita Rani a level eight cultist from The One Show, Nick Robinson and Helen Skelton, who was in the maternity unit warning that we may “hear screaming”.As well as the massed ranks of staff, there were also NHS bigwigs and former patients who were encouraged to stand, clap and thank nurses, doctors, ambulancemen, chemists, the woman on reception, everyone.The nasty suspicion is, of course, that all this BBC worship, which makes Kim Jong-un’s birthday celebrations look really half-ar*ed, carries a political edge and is designed to shut down every single argument apart from the ones that say:A)The NHS needs more money. Or B) the NHS needs a s***load more money.As righteous as it might make them all feel, however, deep down they know it makes for wretchedly dull television.Hence the presence, on this one, of Britain’s Got Talent winner Lost Voice Guy, who not even the resuscitation unit could help with gags like: “Laughter is the best medicine. So instead of going to hospital when you crack your head open you will be prescribed tickets to go and see Russell Brand . . .”AAAAAAAAARRGH!The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “In 2017 which Hollywood star was made a dame at the age of 100?”Will: “Joan Collins.” Oof.King Kylian Mbappe taking the World Cup by the scruff of the neck with France’s thrilling 4-3 victory over Argentina.The Sky Planner’s damningly accurate verdict on Bear’s Mission With Warwick Davis: “Contains scenes of moderate peril.”Love Island narrator Iain Stirling breaking into a water fight discussion to announce: “God I’m lonely.” And the magnificent Laura going all Malcolm Tucker on Wes after he admitted he wanted to “crack on with Megan”.“Do me a favour then, f*** off.” Truly, hell hath no fury like a Scottish woman scorned.GOOD Morning Britain, Wednesday,  rent-a-gob Afua “problematic” Hirsch says: “I am English, but why do I feel uncomfortable ­answering that question?”Because if you ever stopped playing the professional victim and admitted this great liberal democracy had afforded you all the most ­extraordinary privileges in life, including an ­expensive private education, you’d swiftly have no point, purpose, job or income, obviously.ON Monday’s This Morning, the arrival of “Britain’s Sexiest Cow”, a Jersey milker called Char, prompted the obvious Schofield question: “What was the competition?”Two Friesians, an English Longhorn and Naomi Campbell, I’d imagine.THIS week’s winner is Simon Cowell and a Hawaiian feather god from the Royal Academy’s forthcoming Oceania exhibition, which you’ve probably booked already.Emailed in by Spud, of London.Picture research: Amy Reading.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But they do.Remarkably, one in 20 British nurseries is banning superhero costumes because they believe these colourful outfits are making our children aggressive.This attempted taming of tots doesn’t stop there though.Four in five nurseries won’t allow any weapons — whether they are plastic pirate ­cutlasses or harmless pop guns.This is totally wrong.When I was with my mates on the school yard or messing about on building sites I ­pretended to be Superman or ­a soldier, replaying what I had seen in John Wayne war films.These games teach you vital lessons that you will carry on into later life, like I did with the military.There is kinship, holding your own and negotiating with the kid who is getting a bit rowdy.I learned right and wrong, how to ­interact with others and when I was ­stepping out of line.But it didn’t make me think: “I want to join the Army and kill everyone.” ­Everyone plays those games, and some become accountants.I certainly allowed my daughter to play “fighting” and there is no evidence such activities make people more violent.When kids get out their toy swords or bows there is laughter and joy.This is about the normal competitive urge. Whether it’s sport, watching The X Factor or wishing to be top in your class, there is a desire to win.It is wrong to pretend ­otherwise, because when these kids enter the real world of work they will face a very ­competitive atmosphere.If you don’t fight to get to the top, you will go under.We can’t all be soft and cuddly. ­Societies need people with different talents and attitudes.There is a clear antipathy towards the armed services as a career in these ­nursery bans.Britain is struggling to find new recruits at the moment, and the last thing we need is children growing up believing this is a bad choice.Being a soldier, sailor or part of the RAF are valid ­professions. We need these real-life superheroes.My daughter considered ­joining the Armed Forces. She looked into the idea of a ­military scholarship when she was 18.I was all for that, but in the end she decided upon ­something else.There is an idea that these games are just for boys, but girls want to be involved as well.Warfare is part of our genetic make up.It has been like this since the time of hunter-gatherers who had to defend their food sources — first their hunting grounds then later, when we became farmers, our lands.The reason we have been so successful as a species is the ability to defend ­ourselves.Back in medieval times kids would play with wooden swords and it was once ­obligatory for all males aged over 14 to practise the longbow on Sundays.We all go “ahhh” when we see puppies or kittens tussling and rolling about with their siblings, but what they are doing is learning to defend themselves.The idea that stopping any gameplay which involves ­fighting is going to change hundreds of thousands of years of human development is ­nonsensical.The complaint that toy weapons fuel a chaotic atmosphere in our nurseries is nothing more than a sign of laziness among the employers and employees.They are taking the easy route by simply banning lively games. This is more about making life easier for the staff than it is about helping our kids. They just want the ­children sitting there passively, possibly watching television or playing on a tablet.That is not what young ­children are about. They have a huge amount of energy to burn, and it is wrong to corral them into increasingly sedate life-styles.We have enough problems with obesity without demanding the next generation sit quietly all day long.The truth is that children will use up calories when they run around pretending to be in Star Wars or The Incredibles.The staff shouldn’t be bringing their own political ideas into the playground. They shouldn’t be making the children conform to what they think. Instead they should be focusing on ­fostering the imaginations of children by allowing them to explore these ideas.Steve Jobs, who helped to bring the iPhone and the iPad to the world, was inspired by Star Trek, and there were quite a few people getting zapped on that.By allowing children to play cops and robbers or pirates or cowboys or superheroes they are developing storytelling skills which will be vital in their ­education.Do we want them to come to read ­William Shakespeare with no prior ­knowledge of what conflict is?Any writer will tell you great storytelling needs drama and to have drama you need conflict.Going back as far as Greek literature there was greed, envy and jealousy underpinning the narrative. These nurseries fail to recognise the quality of the gameplay generated by young minds.They should be harnessing the roleplay and getting involved. The staff could ask why one person is always the baddie and what the kids enjoy about being the goodie.Superhero movies always contain a ­positive moral tale that children can learn from. There is good, there is evil, there is a recognition that someone has acted wrongly and they explore ways to improve our behaviour.When kids play cops and robbers, it is the police who win.The baddie always gets their comeuppance and the cops are the smarter ones.It’s not about arming our children with guns, it’s about arming them with the tools they need to be more creative.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I want to apologise for that and for misleading you.But she doubled down on claims that the NAO had failed to take into account all of the changes the Department had made before they released that report.In the letter Sir Amyas Morse also wrote: Your department confirmed this to me in writing on 6 June and we then reached final agreement on the report by 8 June.Ms Mcvey said that the impact of advances in cash for those on Universal Credit and the removal of waiting days for payments were still being felt and cannot have fully been taken into account by the NAO report.The letter claimed Sir Amyas had asked her for meetings but has yet to have secured one. The DWP said its working on getting a date secured.Green MP Caroline Lucas today said she was lying and should resign from her position.She tweeted: Things have reached a new low when the National Audit Office accuses a Cabinet Minister of lying. #UniversalCredit is failing, and if Esther McVey is not up to the job of sorting it out – as seems to be the case – then she has to go.And Labours Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said she could consider her position.It comes after the NAO gave a damning report into Universal Credit, revealing just how its failing.The new welfare scheme is designed to wrap a number of benefits into a single monthly payment, and replace payments like child tax credit, housing benefit and jobseekers allowance.Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently , or you can split the payments if youre part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £348 if youre single, £464 if youre part of a couple or £812 if you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, even if you stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Payments if your payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.The report said that a fifth of claimants payments are delayed, it costs more to run, is taking six years longer than planned to roll out, and is driving people to food banks.But the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions claimed that Universal Credit IS working.In a statement in the Commons in response to the report she dismissed the study, and said it was a unique example of great British innovation.Former Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan-Smith announced the introduction of a Universal Credit in 2010 designed to simplify the benefits system and improve work incentives - making it the landmark policy of his time in government.He backed his successor last week, saying the NAO report was a shoddy piece of work.The Department for Work and Pensions has been approached for comment.But the upfront payment is a loan which means youll have to pay it back.The repayments will be automatically deducted from your Universal Credit payments after youve taken the loan.You should ask for the advance if you dont think youll have enough money to live on between when you apply and when youll get your first payment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000418038157.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"roman skeletons lincoln take away viking house","story":"It’s though they are part of the same burial ground where 23 skeletons were unearthed in a 2015 dig.One of the graves contained a burial pot which would have been filled with a drink to take to the afterlife.They were unearthed at the former site of the Taste Of Marrakesh restaurant in the city centre where a development of 400 student flats is to be built.Among the discoveries were some from the Medieval era -

Do you be extremely reasonable and adjust, or do you face down the EU?“They will come to us eventually, we just need to hold our nerve.”At the same time, Mrs May mounted her own battle against time to try to persuade senior Cabinet ministers to side with her during a make or break Cabinet showdown at Chequers tomorrow.The PM called in Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson yesterday afternoon – seen as two key swing votes around her bitterly divided top table.She argued that her plan to align with Brussels rules on goods and collect EU customs tariffs in order to keep borders with Europe free flowing will only affect 4% of all UK trade, and crucially not stop Britain from pursuing an independent trade policy after Brexit.Mr Davis was coordinating a “ring round” of Brexiteer Cabinet Ministers to make sure they were “all on the same page”.An ally said the ministers would “be ready at Chequers to show very simply where promises made in the PM’s speeches were crossed by the new proposals”. The Brexit Secretary is working closely with Boris Johnson, with both confident that Mr Javid was also still opposed to collecting customs on behalf of the EU – a new system dubbed the Facilitated Customs Arrangement.Ardent backbench Leaver Andrea Jenkyns called on the Brexiteer Cabinet ministers to “show their steel” and block the blueprint, as she ominously warned that Mrs May could be ousted, saying: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs who keep their promises”.Jacob Rees-Mogg led an angry deputation of 40 anti-EU Tory MPs from the eurosceptic European Reform Group to protest at Chief Whip Julian Smith yesterday morning.Mr Smith was told during the stormy meeting that the Tories will be “toast if we welch on Brexit”. Former Leave campaign boss Michael Gove insisted it was for the full Cabinet to decide whether her plan will go forward, in a veiled hint they could overrule the PM.The Environment Secretary – who angrily ripped up a paper on her customs plan in No10 last week – would also not rule out Cabinet resignations, equivocally saying only when he was asked: “I don’t think so”.Another minister predicted there would be resignations after the day-long Chequers showdown.The former Remain backing minister told The Sun: “The time has come to chose.“She cannot take everyone with her any more, so someone is going to walk”.As tensions spiralled on all sides of the Tory party, Business Minister Richard Harrington insisted that no deal “would be completely disastrous for business” – deviating from the Government’s line.Ministers such as Boris and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt who attack firms for going public with their worries “don’t really understand how business works,” Mr Harrington added.GOT a story?

Thai authorities are looking at several possibilities depending on the water levels inside the caves and the weather, she added.Much work has gone into stemming the flow of water into the cave and pumping out the water that is already there, in the hope the boys may not need to dive and if they do, it will be for a shorter distance.Chongklai Voraphongston, deputy director-general of the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, said Huai Nam Dan stream, which runs into the caves, has been completely blocked. The Huai Makok stream meanwhile, which is located to the south of cave and flows into it, has been diverted, using six 200-meter-long (656ft) pipes.Several natural shafts, which allow water to pour into the cave system from above, are being plugged.Major General Bancha Duriyaphan said the volume of water draining from the cave had fallen and was expected to decrease further provided there is no rainfall. The governor of Chiang Rai province said the extraction of the football team and their coach would depend on their physical condition.Mr Osatanakorn said that a new cave, suspected to be connected to the area where the group are located, has been discovered and was being explored.Video footage released overnight showed the group appearing to be in reasonably good health, with a team of Thai navy SEALs treating them for minor injuries on their feet as the boys smiled and made gestures to say \"hello\".One of the boys and the 25-year-old coach are said to be suffering from \"medium\" health problems, but they have all been provided with reflective blankets to keep them warm and further supplies of food. A team of British cave divers, two of whom were the first to locate the footballers, are continuing to help move food and equipment to the place where the team are waiting, which is known locally as Pattaya Beach.The boys are being looked after by seven navy SEALs, including medics, who are staying with them inside the cave.Two of the boys are wearing English football shirts - one the red away kit of the national side and the other a Chelsea top.

There\u0027s just one catch - Jeremy Corbyn will have to be Prime Minister.  A senior Labour spokesman made the announcement today after last night\u0027s nail-biting victory over Colombia on penalties - the first for more than 20 years. The progress of the England team in the world cup is very exciting for people across the country, the Labour spokesman said. Obviously we need not to get ahead of ourselves. But Jeremy believes that if England were to win the World Cup, there should be a public holiday in celebration. All we need now is for both football and Jeremy Corbyn to be coming home.  The Labour spokesman confirmed the bank holiday - shortly after a victory on a date agreed with business chiefs - would be a one-off, rather than an annual event on the anniversary for evermore. However, it would apply to all the nations of the UK - not just England. Jeremy Corbyn has already promised four UK-wide bank holidays on St Andrew\u0027s Day, St George\u0027s Day, St David\u0027s Day and St Patrick\u0027s Day. It\u0027s not been confirmed if the Tory government will also offer a bank holiday. Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s spokesman said of course there was a magnificent result and he said he certainly did watch the penalties at his home in Islington.   But Theresa May did not watch the penalty shoot-out because it was too nerve-wracking, a Downing Street source revealed. The PM praised England\u0027s victory against Colombia, congratulating Gareth Southgate and his team on a great performance. She added the very rare and welcome event witnessed on Tuesday night led to an explosion of relief and most of all joy which could be felt up and down the country.

Labour is already committed to a \u0026pound10 minimum wage by 2020 and the latest research for the Unite union found that the rise for workers aged 18-plus would boost public coffers by \u0026pound5.6 billion a year. Workers in hospitality and retail, where low pay is rife, would be the biggest winners from the increase, according to the research conducted by an economic think-tank. A \u0026pound10 minimum wage would boost net income by more than \u0026pound1,300 a year and would benefit 5.2m female workers and three out of four young workers aged 18 to 20. An ‘intermediate’ increase to \u0026pound9 an hour for workers aged 25 and over, \u0026pound8.70 for those aged 21-24 and \u0026pound8 for 18-20-year-olds would benefit 6.25m workers. The current full National Minimum Wage rate is \u0026pound7.83 per hour for workers aged 25 and over.  The research comes ahead of today’s speech by Labour’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell at Unite’s policy conference in Brighton. Steve Turner, Unite assistant general secretary, said: “Workers’ wallets are running on empty and incomes are being squeezed by cuts to in-work benefits and the government’s chaotic introduction of Universal Credit. “There is something desperately wrong with our economy when 60 per cent of people in poverty are living in working households and over one million food parcels are handed out each year. “As in-work poverty grows, big business is benefitting from corporate welfare which is subsidising low pay across the economy in the form of in-work benefits. “Increasing the minimum wage and national living wage to \u0026pound10 per hour would be a huge boost for young workers and help end poverty pay rates that hospitality workers have to endure. “It would be a virtuous circle helping ease the squeeze on incomes, while increasing the public finances through greater tax revenues and reduced spending on in-work benefits. “A \u0026pound10 per hour minimum wage would mean extra money in people’s pockets which would be spent in communities and on high streets across the UK. It would help breathe life into a flagging economy and make work pay.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tory minister admits no deal","story":"NewsTory minister admits no-deal Brexit would be \u0027complete disaster\u0027 as tensions mount ahead of Chequers summitThe Prime Minister has always insisted “no deal is better than a bad deal”\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter22:25, 4 JUL 2018Updated22:31, 4 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA NO-deal Brexit would be “completely disastrous for business in this country” a minister has admitted, in a fresh blow to Theresa May’s authority. The Prime Minister has always insisted “no deal is better than a bad deal”. But, referring to fears raised by car giant BMW, Business Minister Richard Harrington said: “It’s very hard to see the advantage to businesses like that of us crashing out of the European Union.” No 10 insisted: “We are working hard to secure a good deal on behalf of the British people.” Mrs May is reportedly planning the “softest possible Brexit” ahead of tomorrow’s crunch Cabinet showdown at Chequers.  The beleaguered PM hopes to forge unity among her top team behind her latest customs blueprint. Bidding to quell a Leavers’ revolt, she told the Commons yesterday: “The Brexit that this Government will be delivering and is working to deliver is a Brexit that ensures that we are out of the customs union, we are out of the single market, we are out of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, we are out of the Common Agricultural Policy, we are out of the Common Fisheries Policy, we bring an end to free movement, we take control of our borders, we have an independent trade policy and that we are also able to have a good trade arrangement with the European Union, protecting jobs and prosperity of the future.”  More than 40 Eurosceptic Tories met Chief Whip Julian Smith to warn against a soft Brexit. Former Cabinet Minister Owen Paterson said: “We cannot deliver any of the economic benefits of Brexit without leaving the customs union cleanly and completely, freeing ourselves to forge our own trade relationships with friends and allies across the world and committing to the principles of free trade. “The Conservative manifesto at the last general election - which secured the most votes of any party since 1992 - was unambiguously clear: ‘As we leave the European Union, we will no longer be members of the single market or customs union’. “For the good of every citizen in the country, that promise must now be delivered.” Leading Leaver MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said: “I won’t be reassured until I know the details of what comes out on Friday, one way or the other.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tube posters telling commuters not","story":"NewsTube posters telling commuters not to grope women could help stop sexual harassment, says ministerVictoria Atkins believed posters on the transport network could help curb sexual harassment suffered in the rush-hour.\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editor20:05, 4 JUL 2018NewsMinister Victoria Atkins believe (Image: Getty Images Europe)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTube bosses could wage an ad campaign telling commuters not to grope women passengers, a Government minister suggested today. Victoria Atkins believed posters on the transport network could help curb sexual harassment suffered in the rush-hour. Some travellers see their rail journeys as an opportunity to touch up women, the Minister for Women said. “We know sadly it is a place where people seem to think it’s an opportunity to behave disgustingly,” she told MPs. Ms Atkins believed an advertising drive could be “very powerful”. “Having a campaign on the Tube carriages about, ‘Please don’t think this gives you the right to grab someone’ - that could be very effective because you are all standing up, pressed together, looking at the advert - you can’t avoid it,” she told the Commons Women and Equalities Committee. “I’d be interested in a targeted campaign if the evidence was that would be a good way to spend taxpayers’ money.” Giving evidence on how to tackle sexual harassment of women and girls, she hit out at how females are portrayed in music videos. “Look at how women are depicted in some music videos - it is offensive actually,” she said.  “How we persuade companies that produce those videos to work towards reducing or stopping that, that is a huge piece of work and it has to come from society as much as government.” Research has been commissioned into the impact of online porn on attitudes to women and girls, she told MPs. “Pornography online has exploded exponentially in the last decade and I think that is presenting us with very worrying challenges as to how women are viewed in relationships, in healthy relationships, and what boys expect of them, and what girls expect of themselves.” Outlining a “heartbreaking example”, she told how one boy being helped by a charity “said to his youth worker that he didn’t realise that girls weren’t supposed to cry during sex”. Ms Atkins added: “Where he has learnt that from? We know online pornography played a very, very big role. “People viewing that sort of pornography - why are they doing that? “How does that then influence their treatment of their loved ones, their girlfriends, their wives, their daughters?” Labour MP Jess Phillips asked what would happen if a schoolgirl was targeted by a motorist shouting “nice t**s”. She said: “Do you feel confident that if a 16-year-old girl waiting at a bus stop wearing her school uniform and somebody drives past and shouts that she’s got nice t**s, that she would have a legal or criminal sanction at her disposal?” "},{"url":null,"title":"best tents buy summer best","story":"AdvertorialThe best tents to buy this summer and the best deals - whether you\u0027re going to a festival or on a family holidayHere are the best bargains around if you\u0027re looking to snap up a new tent\u0026nbspShareByDave Masters09:58, 4 JUL 2018Updated13:00, 4 JUL 2018Advertorial\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSummer is the perfect time to pitch up a tent and explore the great outdoors.

Greg and Maria Toole together attacked 60-year-old Dorothy Matthews following the senseless argument about the tray being taken away from an engagement party. Maria, 32, was described as being completely out of control when she dragged Miss Matthews from a taxi in front of her three grandchildren and repeatedly punched her. Her 33-year-old husband Greg then began kicking the grandmother as she lay on the ground of a working men\u0027s club car park in Snodland, Kent. Miss Matthews described how she thought she was going to die as she heard her body cracking.  She told a court all she could do was curl up in a ball and said she thought she would never be able to get up. Greg and Maria Toole, who have six children, acted together in a most unpleasant attack on Miss Matthews, a judge said. Self-emoloyed builder Greg, who has previous convictions for violence, joined in after shouting they should not start on his wife, who gave birth to her sixth child while awaiting trial. Miss Matthews suffered a fractured sternum and three broken neck vertebrae in the violent onslaught, dubbed a sandwich tray war by Judge Adele Williams. It occurred after Miss Matthews\u0027s daughter-in-law helped herself to the plastic sandwich platters as they left the celebrations on February 18 last year. Described in court as being a trial with aspects of the soap opera about it, Miss Matthews was first hit up to 10 times by Maria Toole, whose youngest child is just 15 weeks old. The gran was then kicked and stamped on by Greg. I heard cracks in my body, I could hear my body cracking inside, and then I felt a deep crack. I was in agony, said Miss Matthews. It (the attack) felt like forever. I didn\u0027t think it would end. I thought I was dying. I thought I would never be able to get up and I felt I would die on that spot.  The Tooles, of Snodland, denied inflicting grievous bodily harm but were unanimously convicted by a jury on Friday June 29. Sentencing them today at Maidstone Crown Court in Kent, Judge Adele Williams said jail was inevitable despite the impact on their children. This was a most unpleasant attack upon a woman older than each of you. There was a senseless argument about sandwich trays and you, Maria Toole, began to exchange verbal abuse. You were very drunk and angry and pursued them to the taxi, she told them. It was a joint attack and each of you is equally culpable and responsible. Dorothy Matthews sustained serious injuries and I have heard a victim personal statement from her which makes clear the pain, suffering and distress that she has suffered. She has, not surprisingly, found this to be a deeply traumatic experience and experiences ongoing physical problems. It has also affected her psychologically. She has lost confidence and fears for her future. I\u0027m satisfied proper arrangements have been made for the care of your children but I do not underestimate the effect on the children of separation from both parents. The judge added: You, Maria Toole, were completely out of control. You started the violence. CCTV showed how you ran after them and had to be pulled away and prevented from returning to continue the attack. You, Greg Toole, used your foot to inflict injury by kicking and stamping on your victim. It was a sustained attack, a shod foot was used and two of you were involved. Also, the victim\u0027s grandchildren were present in the taxi.  The court was told the Tooles\u0027 children, three of whom are under school age, will be cared for in their family home by an aunt and their grandmother. However, Judge Williams remarked it would be an advantageous arrangement if Maria and the youngest child were reunited in a mother and baby unit. Miss Matthews, known as Dot, was leaving Snodland Working Men\u0027s Club with her family when she was attacked at about 11.30pm. Just seconds earlier her daughter\u0027s partner, Chelsea Farinaro, had been confronted about leaving with the sandwich servers and so they were returned. Prosecutor Iestyn Morgan said at the start of the trial on June 26: This is a sad case, as most cases are, with aspects of the soap opera about it because this occurred after an engagement party where everything had gone well throughout the evening. Then, at the very end, an argument starts over a plate or tray of sandwiches being taken from the party. That argument ends up with a 60-year-old lady in hospital with a fracture to her sternum and several fractures to her neck. Miss Matthews spent two weeks in hospital recovering from her injuries, needed full-time care for several weeks after her discharge, and was off work for three months. In a statement to the court, the one-time keen walker said: I feel like I want to put a sign around my neck saying \u0027Fragile\u0027. One thing the assault has taught me is that you don\u0027t know what is ahead of you. I went out for the evening to what was considered a safe place. I am now nervous about being out and about and fear for my future. I don\u0027t want this to turn me into an old lady. I\u0027m 60 years old and have always considered myself to be young at heart. But since this has happened I feel my age. I am angry this has happened and I am upset my grandchildren were there and this will be in their memories. I cannot believe they did this in front of my grandchildren. It is despicable.

The distraught mum-to-five, of Croydon, south London, added: My heart is just broken that she has been taken away from me, I would give anything to get her back. Everyone that saw her smile fell in love with her. To know that we are never going to see that smile again has just broken us.  I was sat outside [on Tuesday] and a white feather flew down, I thought it was an angel coming to look after her, not take her away. But she was gone that night. She started going cold. I thought if I just put my body on her and warmed her up she will come back to us, but it didn’t work. I can’t bear the thought of not seeing her smile again. Sheeran, whom Melody admired and met earlier this year, paid tribute to the youngster on Instagram today. Heartbroken Nigel, 47, said: Melody\u0027s heart was the strongest, we said that if her heart stops then that’s her way of telling us she had had enough. She opened her eyes and looked at us, he said. She was trying to talk to us, her mouth was moving. She was trying to say goodbye. She has changed my life forever.

The streets of Cardiff were littered with used textbooks, cutlery, furniture and even cars packed with rubbish.  Alleyways around the Cathays area, a hotspot for student living, became dumping grounds for wrecked sofas and mattresses, reports Wales Online .  As of July 1 hundreds of students have flocked from the city, ready for two months of bliss in the sunshine before embarking on a new year of studying. The car park at Cathays train station, used by thousands of students, was covered in rubbish overflowing from a YCMA donation bank.  At its foot lies a full deconstructed kitchen, Tupperware, chopping boards, bowls, pots and pans and bottles of ketchup and mayonnaise all piled up. Expensive-looking textbooks, chairs, hairbrushes and DVDs were also poking out of the throng. As Paleontolgy postgraduate student Richard Jones walks past he stops to take a quick picture on his phone. He said: I was walking past a few weeks ago and there was a guy saying there was a handbag there that was selling for \u0026pound30 on eBay. He said he was going back the next day and fill the car up. A few minutes walk from the station lies Miskin Street. On the corner two green and white striped deck chairs stand ready for their occupants to return and enjoy the sunshine.  On closer inspection, however, the seats are ripped, with a large bottle of Smirnoff vodka lying yards away. Meanwhile others have taken to twitter to share pictures of the mess, including a car left full to bursting with belongings. A few yards away builder Christopher Williams is hard at work, gutting a house under the beating sun. The plan is to turn the semi-detached house from separate flats to one big HMO, or house in multiple occupation. For him the state of empty student houses are something he has had to get used to, although the smell of rotting food never quite goes away. The 39-year-old said: When I started I was shocked. Mainly it\u0027s just dust and dirt but you do expect that. Then there\u0027s freezers full of stuff, food in the cupboards, in the fridges. It\u0027s all mouldy but what can you do? When you have a fridge with no electricity you just have to see what\u0027s in it. The smell just hits you. [My colleague] has got a really weak stomach. It\u0027s just sad for the landlords, they put their hearts into these places.  In a matter of weeks the house will be completely renovated ready for a new batch of inhabitants. Luckily, not everything inside it will be scrapped. The Cardiff builder said: Nine times out of ten I will take things to charity shops so they can make a bit of money. This morning someone came and picked up two cookers, gas hobs and extractor fans. If you give them a bit of a clean most of it can be re-used. Sometimes there are clothes with tags still on. A few doors down from Christopher postgraduate student Jessica Jones is busy scrubbing her front yard to remove the debris from last year\u0027s tenants. Today is her second day in Cardiff after moving from Manchester to study music. The 22-year-old said: The street looks derelict but inside the houses are quite nice. I come from Manchester so I\u0027m quite used to use but there are some messy students around here. A lot of people have left stuff they don\u0027t really want. There\u0027s a few interesting bits, chairs, barbecues. The amount of money that students get through is crazy, things become disposable after a year. Around Cathays other students have had similar experiences. Royal College of Welsh Music and Drama student Katie Bayliss has still got one more week before moving out.  She said: It\u0027s stressful. You have to make sure everything is spick and span while making sure you get your own stuff ready. Some people just don\u0027t care and the sea gullscome and open the bags. We try our best obviously because there are families near but you can\u0027t help it when the seagulls are ripping everything. The worst is the food left in the recycling bins. In this heat it\u0027s horrible, I have to hold my breath walking past it.  Around Cardiff there are thought to be 75,000 students across Cardiff University , Cardiff politan and the University of South Wales.  On Tuesday afternoon Cardiff council maintenance teams and members of Cardiff University are circling the area, determined to keep up with the volume of rubbish coming from each house. On Rhymney Street local landlord Michael Krokos is getting ready to go visit one of the seven HMOs he owns across Cardiff. Born and bred in the city, he claims to know every tenant on a first name basis to minimize the risk of nasty shocks when they move out. The 50-year-old Cardiff graduate said: It\u0027s quite spooky like this. It feels like one of those zombie movies. He added: The problem is not so much the students but relying on the duty contractors as you book them months in advance like the cleaners, painters, decorators. They know they\u0027ve got you in a tight position so they can mess you around or not turn up. A bigger problem still for Michael is absentee landlords who are not so quick to clean and update houses. He said: There are issue with landlords but the first thing I try and do if find out what the agents are and if the agents aren\u0027t going to be compliant I go to the registry office to find out who owns it.

Elsie Allcock was born in an upstairs bedroom of the two-bed home and has no plans to leave. She grew up there with her four older siblings and parents, who rented the property. Elsie then bought it in 1960 for \u0026pound250 with the help of a council loan, following her parents’ deaths. Recalling the Hall family’s early days at the house in Nottinghamshire, she said: “My mother and father came to live in Huthwaite in 1900 when my sister Emma was two years old.  “My father was a coal miner at Blackwell Colliery. My mother was a hard-working woman. She did washing five days a week for us and other people. “She had no washing machine, just a tub to boil clothes in. It was very hard work. “My sister Mary and I would take the baskets of washing back to the customers all ironed and ready to wear. All for half a crown that is two shillings and sixpence.” The mum of two was born in June 1918, towards the end of the First World War.  Back then, the house was lit and heated using paraffin oil lamps and candles. The family had an outdoor toilet in the 12ft x 8ft garden, which is still used to this day. Elsie, who turned 100 last Thursday, went on: “When I was eight years old in 1926 the coal miners were on strike and the men were off work for weeks, with no money coming in. “In those days you had to have coal to get hot water. We had to put pennies in the gas meter. Weeks went by. No work. No money. No coal.” Growing up in the house with a big family also meant space was a challenge. At bedtime Elsie often found herself topping and tailing with her older siblings.  She left school aged 14 and stayed at home to look after the family following the death of her mum Eliza in 1932. Her dad Mark died 17 years later. And apart from a one-month stay in hospital in the 1960s, Elsie has lived in the house ever since, raising her sons there with husband Bill Allcock. The couple were wed for 55 years before Bill died from cancer in 1995. Their son Raymond, 72, said: “We knew everyone on that street at one time, but now there are not even half a dozen.” "},{"url":null,"title":"isle bute alesha macphail cops","story":"NewsIsle of Bute: Alesha MacPhail cops descend on family home where six-year-old was staying before she was murderedOfficers have been seen searching the gardens surrounding Alesha\u0027s grandmother\u0027s home - they have also seized a vehicle on the island as part of their investigation\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByLucinda CameronPaul WardJack AitchisonSophie Evans14:13, 4 JUL 2018Updated14:41, 4 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Cops have descended on the home where little Alesha MacPhail was staying before she was murdered - as the hunt for her killer continues.   Smiley Alesha, six, was reported missing from her grandmother Angela King\u0027s home on the Isle of Bute, Scotland, on Monday morning.  Her body was found less than three hours later in woodland on the site of a former hotel in Rothesay by a member of the public. This morning, a team of police vans were seen arriving outside Ms King\u0027s property, where Alesha had been staying while on holiday.  Officers entered the Ardbeg Road home, near Rothesay, shortly after 11am and could be seen searching the gardens surrounding it.  Police tape has also been put up around the building, while tributes have been laid by stunned locals, the Daily Record reports.  Cops had yesterday seized a vehicle on the island as part of their investigation into the death of friendly and popular Alesha. The schoolgirl, from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, was a few days into a three-week break to visit family when she disappeared. She was reported missing at 6.25am on Monday, with her body discovered in woodland at about 9am.  Last night, following the results of a post-mortem examination, police confirmed that they were treating the schoolgirl\u0027s death as murder. Cops have warned islanders to be vigilant about the safety of their children and the security of their homes as investigations continue. Meanwhile, locals have spoken of their shock at the death of Alesha. Reverend Owain Jones has opened his United Church of Bute in Rothesay to allow people to visit at any time. He said: We\u0027re all absolutely staggered, we have no words for this and it\u0027s beyond any power of words to express. We\u0027re all just really sitting in a kind of shared stunned silence just trying to uphold each other.  Bute is one of these places that is incredibly safe, you take all sorts of things for granted here and don\u0027t panic if you forget to lock the house or whatever. It\u0027s not a remote island in the classic sense - it\u0027s only 90 minutes to Glasgow - but even so it is an island and we all know each other at least by sight, and it\u0027s an extremely safe place and there is no context for this. We wondered what we could do as a church by way of a response and we have opened the church, after the news overnight, to people of all faiths and none to just come and sit and use the space as is helpful to them. Meanwhile, Detective Superintendent Stuart Houston said Alesha\u0027s family were utterly devastated at her death and appealed for anyone with information to come forward.  He is still keen to speak to people who were involved in the search for the missing girl that was conducted early on Monday. He added: Alesha had lots of friends who will no doubt find it very difficult to comprehend why they will never see their friend again. For such a young girl to have her life taken away is incomprehensible. Earlier yesterday, Alesha\u0027s devastated mum Georgina Lochrane, 23, whom she lived with, sobbed uncontrollably as police escorted her to see tributes that had been laid for her daughter outside the flat. She placed a school photograph of her little girl beside the flowers. It is understood that Georgina carried out a formal identification of her daughter\u0027s body after it was taken to the mainland.  Alesha’s dad Robert MacPhail, who is estranged from Georgina, also went to see the tributes to his daughter yesterday. He was supported by his girlfriend, Tonii Mclachlan. Alesha was a pupil at Chapelside Primary School in Airdrie, where the headteacher said she would be greatly missed. Wendy Davie said: “Alesha started with us at Chapelside Primary in August 2016 and had just finished primary two. “She loved being at school and enjoyed all aspects of literacy, in particular writing. She was such a perfectionist in her handwriting and was very proud of her work.

He’s barred the vehicle gate too, so the owners have to trudge to the nearest village and carry back bottled water for drinking and washing. The locked gate also means that there’s no access for the emergency services. The dispute at the site at Claverley, Shropshire, began after a company called Sought After Location Limited bought the land and an adjacent caravan park. The chalet owners claim that they’re being strong-armed into leaving by company director William Flannigan, 28. Brian and Carrianne Byrne renovated their chalet after buying it last year. “He wants us to sign a holiday site licence, which he could revoke at any time and force us out,” Brian said. Carrianne added: “We have to climb over the stile when we bring back bottled water. “We use rain water to fill the toilet cistern. We can’t really shower.” The pair spent \u0026pound25,000 sprucing up their chalet with a new bathroom, kitchen and carpets. “It’s really nice but we can’t move it, it would fall apart if we tried,” said Carrianne.  Another couple, June and David Northcote, bought their chalet in 2000 and say that they were promised a 99-year lease by the previous land owner. “William Flannigan visited me and promised the same lease, shook my hand and promised to put details in writing, but never did,” says June. “They’ve told us to sign the new licence or take our bungalows away. We cannot move them, they are permanent structures with planning permission.” She added that there had been no site maintenance this year and now the dry overgrown grass was a fire waiting to happen so close to the wooden bungalows.  Another owner, Jo Finzi, bought her chalet 10 years ago and says: “Mr Flannigan promised me an offer for my chalet but never confirmed any price other than saying ‘It won’t be what you paid for it’.” William Flannigan responded through his lawyer Lewis Griffiths of Excello Law, who says that the owners have no legal right to remain. “They are not residents, they never have been, they never will be and they have never lived permanently on the park,” he said.  “Mr Northcote in particular keeps blarting on about ‘I was promised this, I was promised that’, well, you can’t sue on a promise. “If I say I’ll clean your car and then don’t do it, you can’t sue me. “The chalet part of the site does have planning permission for permanent residential use, but that’s nothing to do with the people who own the chalets and everything to do with the person who owns the land, which is now my client.”  Griffiths says the owners only have themselves to blame for not taking legal advice when buying the properties. “Why would you spend a load of money on something without securing your position. Did you not speak to your solicitor?” he demanded. “They just don’t seem to grasp the fact that they’ve got no security of tenure.” Meanwhile, he says, the water is staying off until the new site licences are signed. “They are not in a position to negotiate,” Griffiths adds. “You’ve got to have something setting out the legal basis between the landowner and the person occupying the land. They don’t seem to grasp that.  “It may have been that the previous owner was a bit laissez-faire and didn’t renew the licences every year but I don’t care about that and neither does my client. We own the land now and not the previous owner.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mother explains chooses breastfeed two","story":"NewsMother explains why she chooses to breastfeed her two year old - even when sitting on toiletBecky Vieira, 42, said she receives regular criticism from online trolls after posting about her extended breastfeeding of her son, Archer - and has even been him as he now has teeth\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAlyce Collins13:34, 4 JUL 2018Updated13:37, 4 JUL 2018NewsWriter and stay-at-home mum, Becky Vieira, 42 (Image: Becky Vieira)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mother has explained why she still breastfeeds her two-year-old despite being bitten by a son who now has teeth. Writer and stay-at-home mum, Becky Vieira, 42, has perfected her technique so well she now feeds son Archer while she\u0027s cooking and even while she\u0027s on the toilet. The mum, from San Francisco, USA, has become an Instagram heroine for other mums after posting about her extended breastfeeding of her son, Archer, 22 months. But not everyone agrees with her decision - and she has been targeted by online trolls who have told her she\u0027s freak and even contacted by men who find it sexual and send her graphic photos.  Becky was overjoyed when her wish of becoming a mother was finally answered at the age of 40, but with this came so many unanswered questions and an overwhelming struggle to get everything done \u0027right\u0027 by society\u0027s eyes. Becky has been breastfeeding Archer for 22 months, and she shows no sign of weaning him off her milk, despite the criticism she faces on a regular basis. Mums are told that we must breastfeed our babies, but it\u0027s considered wrong if we breastfeed for more than a year or so, Becky said. I breastfed my son at first because I knew it was good for him, but it was painful and awkward at first.  It was uncomfortable initially, it felt like someone rubbed sandpaper on my nipple and put it into a pencil sharpener. But I saw how healthy he was and how he was growing. Like everyone tells you, it gets better with time, patience and practice. Archer was diagnosed with acid reflux, so his paediatrician was worried formula would aggravate his situation. So originally, I just wanted to get my son passed his reflux but look at us now! We take it day by day, and as long as it works for both of us we\u0027ll continue to breastfeed. But it is getting more uncomfortable as he gets older and bigger now.  In many ways it\u0027s easier because we\u0027ve been doing it for so long that we\u0027ve perfected things. I can do other things while I breastfeed, like vacuuming or go to the toilet. But he will grab my breasts which isn\u0027t fun. Some people say they could never breastfeed a child with teeth and he has bitten me a handful of times if he\u0027s been falling asleep. Archer started eating solid food at the age of six months, but he still has breast milk every day on top of this. Usually, Archer will be breastfed in the morning and then have two feedings later in the day. Many people believe there are lots of benefits to extended breastfeeding, and Becky has even had her breast milk analysed for its nutritional value which showed it was still full of vitamins and healthy fats.  Other mums have said I made them feel less alone and helped normalise extended breastfeeding, Becky explained. Many mums who were unable to breastfeed are incredibly supportive and encourage me to continue. I\u0027ve had mums tell me how much they miss it themselves and wish me well it\u0027s amazing, it feels like a true community. Of course, there are trolls who offer unsolicited opinions and tell me I\u0027m wrong for nursing still and that I\u0027m enabling bad behaviour on my son\u0027s part. There are even some men who find it sexual and send me graphic photos. I\u0027ve had people call me a \u0027freak\u0027 and had men say it\u0027s \u0027sexy\u0027 and that my son is \u0027lucky\u0027. It\u0027s funny, with all the mums in the world you\u0027d think we\u0027d be more supportive and open about things. There\u0027s still pressure to present an image that everything is neat and tidy at all times.

The heatwave is set to continue and by the weekend temperatures are likely to get to as high as 31C. A Met Office spokesman told : There will be lots of sunshine across the UK but through the day tomorrow there is a risk of heavy showers and some will be of a thundery nature. There is a risk of thunderstorms tomorrow particularly in the south and south east of England. Some places might see a downpour.  But there will still be sunshine. And by Friday it will be dry as temperatures continue to rise. Temperatures could hit 31C in the south by Saturday.  The glorious heat in Britain is forecast to remain even through the second half of July and August. Met Office forecaster Helen Roberts previously said: “There’s no sign of an end to the heat. Warmth looks like continuing for the first half of July. And forecast models point to above-average temperatures for much of July and August.” High pressure over the UK is causing the high levels of sunshine and clear skies.

Jack Shepherd, 30, allegedly caused the death of Charlotte Brown, 24, when they were thrown into the water after the boat they were in hit a floating tree trunk. The vessel was travelling at twice the speed limit for the stretch of water on the River Thames in London, the Old Bailey heard. Shepherd is accused of breaching his duty of care to Charlotte by letting her take the wheel without wearing a jacket, having a kill cord or the skill to steer. The steering wheel was not fully responsive and needed to be moved extra degrees, jurors were told. The court heard how in a video she filmed before the crash, Ms Brown could be heard saying oh my God, you\u0027re going so fast. The pair were on their first date and had dined at The Shard where they downed two bottles of red wine, having met just hours earlier, the court heard. After getting a taxi to Shepherd\u0027s houseboat in Hammersmith, west London, at around 9.15pm on December 8, 2015, the pair went to see the Houses of Parliament in Westminster.  The court heard how after drinking some more wine the pair jumped into his speed boat and downed Champagne, which he used as part of his seduction ritual. On the return journey to west London Shepherd and Charlotte swapped places so she could steer, it was alleged. But as she tried to avoid construction barges at speed she swerved and struck the log and the boat capsized, the Old Bailey heard. Shepherd\u0027s calls for help were heard by residents near Plantation Wharf at around 11.45pm and the Met\u0027s riverboats, police helicopter, the Coastguard, and the London Fire Brigade alerted, the court was told.  Charlotte, also known as Charli, was pulled from the water between Putney Bridge and Wandsworth Bridge at around 12.10am after floating upstream, jurors were told. She died later that morning in hospital, the cause of death was given as cold water immersion, a post mortem revealed. Shepherd managed to cling to the boat and was also hypothermic when he was found by rescuers in the river clutching the upturned bow. The Old Bailey heard today that on the start of the journey to Westminster, Shepherd was travelling at three times the speed limit of 12knots, and when Charlotte started coming back she was going at 20knots at the point of impact, when the limit is 12knots.  One witness told police he saw the boat going so fast he thought it was a chase. The boat was also seen veering from side to side when Charlotte was driving, jurors were told. Aftab Jafferjee, prosecuting, said there were a number of safety features the boat did not have, including a kill cord which stops the engine during an emergency. He also said the 14ft vessel\u0027s windscreen suffered from crazing which made it hard to see through and the driver had to sit on the back of the seat. Also, the wooden planks under the driver\u0027s seat were rotten, jurors were told. Mr Jafferjee added: It was an accident waiting to happen, we say, due to the state of the boat that night and one of these features could have so easily been the cause of her death and the cause of her going in to the water. The steering system should have been flush but it didn\u0027t do that. It just went in partly, which was a problem for the steering column shift. That was not secured properly on the side so the cable would slide. It meant the steering needed to be moved several extra degrees from left to right before the motor even reacted to the input from the driver.  Whilst the owner maybe over time become used to it, but a novice or inexperienced driver would have great difficulty controlling this boat and keeping it on a straight line. The kill cord should have been attached to Jack Shepherd\u0027s wrist in case he fell into the water the engine would stop. If the kill cord is not used there is nothing to stop the boat from circling around and around. Jurors heard Shepherd had been speeding before handing 24-year-old Miss Brown the wheel to give her an extra thrill. The court heard it is not a legal requirement to wear a life jacket, but that Shepherd had been warned by police it was the right thing to do. Me Jafferjee added: This was an extremely busy waterway at night in an extremely challenging location. There was a considerable degree of rubbish and large number of floating tree trunks. The danger to small vessels is high and high competence in needed. Anyone who frequently travels on the Thames would be aware of this. The change of driver, experts say, allows for the somewhat erratic behaviour as the boat approached Plantation Wharf as well as the apparent last minute actions to avoid a submerged object.

Natasha Scott, 21, wept as she was sentenced to three years in prison for causing death by dangerous driving .  A court heard the mum had only passed her driving test 11 months before the smash, which happened after she lost control of her Vauxhall Corsa on a rural lane near Ayr, west Scotland. Scott ploughed her car into a fence, brick wall and telegraph pole before coming to a halt. Her boyfriend Kai Milligan, 21, died at the scene after a fence post smashed through a rear window and struck him in the face on July 24, 2016.  Three teens were hurt in the collision. One - a 15-year-old lad - needed major surgery to reconstruct his face. Scott was caged on Tuesday after she admitted causing death by dangerous driving and injuring the other passengers. She was also banned from the roads for five years. Sentencing at the High Court in Glasgow, Judge Lady Stacey said: You know your dangerous driving caused the death of Kai Milligan and you have to live with that knowledge.  You also caused serious injury to another young man. The accident happened because you failed to negotiate a hill crest and a left hand bend. Your exact speed cannot be ascertained but you increased your speed on the straight and failed to decrease it despite there being a bend and signs on the road to slow down. You knew that road having driven it many times.  The court heard how Scott had increased her speed  seconds before the crash. The Vauxhall became airborne after the reckless motorist lost control at a bend.  Scott, from Ayr, later gave a no comment interview to police.

The banner was organised by Rise and Resist NYC, a group which said it was at the Statue of Liberty to urge President Trump abolish the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and reunite families, halt deportations and end detention as a deterrent, nbcnewyork reports.

But that\u0027s exactly what happened when Alex and Jess Monney decided to spruce their house up a little. In a post on Twitter, which so far has been liked more than 40,000 times, Alex revealed that their contractor had uncovered something unusual when demolishing their bathroom. They were sent a photo of part of the wall, which to their surprise, featured a message.  It said: Hi! We\u0027re the Shinseki\u0027s. We remodelled this bathroom summer 1995. If you\u0027re reading this, that means you\u0027re remodelling the bathroom again. What\u0027s wrong with the way we did it?

The couple have since confirmed that they will be adding their own message into the wall during the remodelling process.

Actress Rosey Blair and her boyfriend Houston Hardaway were flying home to Dallas, Texas but realised they hadn\u0027t booked seats together. Hoping to enjoy each other\u0027s company, they asked a woman if they could switch seats with her. She agreed and they made a joke that her new seat partner could become the love of her life.

Anthony Doolin bought the property, in Brisbane, Australia, over three years ago for $1.35million (\u0026pound754,000). But it wasn\u0027t until he went wandering around his 16.5 hectares of land that he made the startling find. And it turns out the estate, which is just 12 miles from the central business district of Brisbane, is home to number of other mines. They had remained hidden in the hills since the turn of the century - until now. A surprised Mr Doolin revealed he immediately thought of movie character Indiana Jones when he stumbled upon the mines.  He told realestate.au: We weren’t told about it, we just found it there one day. “I nearly fell over, I just pictured Indiana Jones and underground railroads. There was a lot of mining at the turn of the century and in those hills there are quite a few little mines. It’s about six metres deep and is still intact.”  Despite the spectacular discovery, Mr Doolin didn\u0027t explore the mines further in search of precious gold. And he parted ways with the stunning estate last week. His mother Jane sold the property for him. The reported asking price of $1.65million (\u0026pound922,000) was not met and the Mr Doolin eventually settled for the same fee he had initially paid for it.

We do need as many quality, affordable houses as we can get. There is always a demand, I think.“So in all, this is to be welcomed by the Stobswell Forum.”Hillcrest’s director of development and new business, David Zwirlein, said the plans will provide homes for future generations of Ellengowan residents.He said: “This is an exciting milestone in the journey to regenerate Ellengowan Estate. The central aim of the redevelopment is to offer a new home to existing residents who wish to remain living on the estate.“If approved, the proposals outlined in this application will provide high quality, energy-efficient homes to current and future generations of Ellengowan residents.”Architects Collective Architecture submitted the plans, which are the result of a period of extensive planning and community consultation.If the application is successful, demolition will start on the site at the end of the year with construction work beginning in early 2019.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b335b8da880a.jpg ","title":"donkey joins in celebrations as dundee woman sandra turns 50","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBirthday girl Sandra McIntosh had an unusual visitor on her special day in the shape of Donkey Bond, a miniature donkey.Sandra, from Downfield, turned 50 and was delighted by the visit from the cute donkey who lives with owner Alison Wiseman at Balnuith Farm, Tealing.The surprise was arranged by Sandra’s fiance Scott Findlay and their friend Nicky Millen.Shocked Sandra said: \u0026#8220You don’t expect to open your door and a donkey to be there, do you?“Maybe flowers or chocolates but I would never have imagined Donkey Bond would be there.“He was so cute.

I like that about him.“When I knew I was moving, these things were very important to me and that’s why I came here.“The tradition of the club I know and I’ve heard good things about it as well. It should be in the top division and I want to be part of helping the team to go up.”Siegrist confirmed a chat with his team-mate at last club Vaduz, Thomas Konrad, was a big help in him making up his mind to move to Scotland.Where he does disagree with the former Dundee defender is which is the No 1 outfit in his new home city.“I’ve played alongside Thomas for the last two years, so when I did make contact here I called him and asked him about the city.“It’s always good to get some information. He has told me some nice things about the city and he was very complementary about the place.“He tried to tell me the other team was the big one, so I didn’t listen. Obviously he played for them, but it’s all good.“He told me about some derbies but I believe he got sent off in one and did well in others. That’s him.“He did tell me that everyone is football crazy here and, when I arrived in the city myself, I couldn’t believe the stadiums are literally across the road from each other.“It’s good to be in a city where football is really a big thing.”With Slovakian goalie Matej Rakovan also signing up, Siegrist’s first challenge is to claim the No 1 jersey.It’s something he’s up for and believes having two keepers battling for a place in the team will prove a good thing for both men.“You come into a new club and you have to prove yourself. You’ve got to do all you can to earn the shirt. We’ve got to make it as hard as possible for the gaffer to pick one of us.“It’s his decision at the end of the day but I will be putting everything I can into making sure I play.“Everywhere you go you have to have competition. Especially the goalie position, there is only one who can play and, in every time you go, that’s how it is.“It is good to be on your toes, it’s good to have someone pushing you either way, so it makes you train that little bit harder.“It’s a long, tough pre-season and obviously my ambition is to be the No 1 goalkeeper and that’s Matej’s ambition as well. That’s how it should be.”Whether he’s between the sticks or on the bench, his focus is already on what every United fan wants to see – the team getting promotion in the coming season.And after a week working with the new-look squad, he’s feeling optimistic about that.“The main focus of the club is promotion. The first few meetings I had with the gaffer, it’s all about getting promotion.“It’s a hard task, obviously it’s a hard league to get out of, but it’s good to be part of an ambitious club that wants to achieve something.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/AB8U9280.jpg-582x564.jpg ","title":"dundee new boy nathan ralph happy to complete switch but wanted his move sooner","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee new boy Nathan Ralph has revealed if he’d had his way he’d have been at Dens Park at the turn of the year.Back in the January window, the Tele reported the Dark Blues were keen on the left-back after being impressed by his performances at National League South outfit Woking.So, too, were several English league outfits but when he heard there could be a chance to head for the Scottish Premiership, the 25-year-old wanted to jump at it immediately.Rather than take the huff when it didn’t materialise, the former Ipswich Town kid, resolved it would happen this summer.“The thing happened in January when Dundee were interested and I said to my manager at the time, look I want to play higher,” he explained.“I don’t think at the time they were keen on me going, so I just thought if I can get a good season under my belt, hopefully, it will still be there at the end of the season. Thankfully, it was and I’m here now.”Over the past week he’s been getting to know his new team-mates in pre-season training.He’s liked what he’s seen of them and is loving the workouts under his new boss Neil McCann.“I’m enjoying it a lot. The training has been very good. Sometimes you feel you are just running and running during pre-season but, to be fair to the manager, he’s had us doing ball work straight away.“With running as well, of course, but it’s been with the ball and match specific stuff so I am really enjoying it.“You can get that hard work when you have the ball as well and it is important because, at the end of the day, we are footballers.“We need to control the ball and things when we are tired in games, so, to me, it makes perfect sense to be training this way.“And I’ve only been here a few days now but already I’ve been impressed with the players. Technically, and in terms of the morale of the squad, they are very good.”While he wouldn’t claim to be an expert on the Scottish Premiership yet, what he’s already realised is that it’s a good place to be right now.With top English Premier League boss Brendan Rodgers already at Celtic and Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard taking the reins at Rangers, he knows it’s a league that’s being noticed.“I don’t know too much about the Premiership up here yet but what I do know is that it’s a good standard and it’s something I’ve been really looking forward to being a part of.“I’m stepping up and it will be a challenge, for sure, but I don’t think I will be out of my depth and I am looking forward to playing in it.“I’ve been told it’s definitely a good time to be coming to this league.

I love being able to tell the customer that the owners actually made the gift they are buying.”When it comes to working in retail Hannah says the most important thing is how you communicate with customers.She said: “The whole concept of the shop is to give customers that personal touch.“The most important part of that is how we interact with our customers.“The first thing you learn when you start work in the shop is everything else stops when a customer comes in and they become the most important thing.“We always say the staff in here love a chat but there is nothing better than a customer saying they have had a great experience in your store.“I really enjoying being able to serve someone well as that is what they will go and tell friends and family about and recommend the store to them.“You have to be approachable when working in retail and confident and comfortable speaking to people.“Confidence is something I have had to work on throughout my career, but it is something I would urge anyone interested in retail to work on too.”Although Hannah climbed up the retail ladder through working in several shops, there are many courses on offer in Dundee.Dundee and Angus College offer several in both retail and retail management.These include Introduction to Fashion Retailing where students get hands-on experience working within the college’s gift shop.HNC Retail sees students gaining a broad knowledge of the retail industry and the skills and qualities required for a diverse range of careers.The college also offers HND Retail Management where students have the opportunity to gain work experience managing and promoting the colleges pop-up shop, Tempus.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b39f0252c187-516x564.jpg ","title":"huge turnover of players has cost dundee united dear","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSince relegation from the top flight in 2016, Dundee United have seen a massive 86 transfers in and out of Tannadice.The remarkable turnover of players just shows what the price of failure is – by the club as a whole and those players, some of whom have been and gone with very little success.And, with business still to be done over the next couple of months in re-shaping the current squad, that total is expected to rise even further before too long.Since the departure of Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven at the end of January 2015 – the point where United’s downfall from cup finals and European football towards the second tier can be traced back to – the complete lack of continuity is an obvious factor in the club’s failure over recent seasons.Add in four managerial changes in that time and that’s a recipe for a whole lot of trouble.The number 86, obviously, includes a few players twice – i.e. they were transferred in and then transferred out – but since relegation the Tangerines have signed a huge 42 players in the past two years.Manager Csaba Laszlo has lifted the lid on how unorganised the club were last season and the number of ins and outs only strengthens that perception.This summer, Csaba, with help from chief scout Paul Sturrock, has brought in nine players already – with more expected.The big hope is this completely revamped team can finally get them back to the Premiership – something the 33 signings before them have distinctly failed to do.The pressure is on Nicky Clark, Callum Booth, Sam Wardrop, Fraser Aird, Craig Curran, Frederic Frans, Benjamin Siegrist, Matej Rakovan and Christoph Rabitsch to be the men that fire the Tangerines back up and have Arabs watching top-flight action come 2019/20.Last summer, 19 players were brought in by then manager Ray McKinnon and 13 the previous one immediately after suffering the drop.Of those 32, only 10 remain at the club and a few of those probably have a short future. They are Lewis Toshney, William Edjenguele, Stewart Murdoch, Fraser Fyvie, Deniz Mehmet, Billy King, Paul McMullan, Tam Scobbie, James Keatings and Sam Stanton. How many of them play a meaningful role in the push for promotion this coming season, however, is certainly up for debate.In the past two campaigns under McKinnon and Laszlo, United haven’t been a million miles away from getting themselves up through the play-offs.Add in a bit of continuity through their playing squad and around it surely can only help the club get back to where they feel they belong.A list of those 86 transfers, who have arrived, departed or done both: Harry Souttar, Darko Bodul, Eiji Kawashima, Chris Erskine, Michal Szromnik, Callum Morris, John Rankin, Paul Paton, Florent Sinama-Pongolle, Henri Anier, Edward Ofere, Guy Demel, Ryan Dow, Gavin Gunning, Toshney, Frank van der Struijk, Nick van der Velden, Willo Flood, Cammy Bell, Edjenguele, Murdoch, Tope Obadeyi, Alex Nicholls, Tony Andreu, Thomas Mikkelsen, Cammy Smith, Wato Kuate, Paul Dixon, Coll Donaldson, Simon Murray, Sean Dillon, Charlie Telfer, Luis Zwick, Blair Spittal, Brad Smith, Ali Coote, Grant Gillespie, Fyvie, Emil Lyng, Patrick N’Koyi, Paul Quinn, King, Scobbie, McMullan, Keatings, Craig Slater, Scott McDonald, Jordie Briels, Harry Lewis, Stanton, Brandon Mason, Anthony Ralston, Bilel Mohsni, Clark, Booth, Wardrop, Aird, Curran, Frans, Siegrist, Rakovan and Rabitsch.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b39f01324c04-e1530527591774-817x564.jpg ","title":"new boy elton looks to rocket dundee up the premiership table and says the skys the limit","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew boy Elton Ngwatala insists the sky’s the limit for Dundee as they look to make an assault on the Premiership top-half next season.The French midfielder, signed from Kidderminster Harriers earlier in the summer, made his second appearance in dark blue in last night\u0026#8217s 1-0 win at Cowdenbeath.This followed his debut on Friday night in a 1-1 friendly draw with Brechin City at Glebe Park.Fellow summer arrival, Senegalese striker Jean Alassane Mendy, got the visitors’ only goal just before the hour-mark as Kharl Madianga, Jack Hamilton, Nathan Ralph and trialist Brian Nana-Sinkam also got their first run-outs for Dundee.And 25-year-old Ngwatala believes there is no stopping him and his new team-mates from scaling the heights in the top flight next term – with a top-six finish a known aim of manager Neil McCann.“Friday night was my first game and it felt good to play with the new lads,” he said.“They are all new team-mates for me but, with 45 minutes in the tank, now I can improve.“Hopefully, within the next couple of weeks it will be perfect.“I think there is no limit next season. We have to take each game one by one and do the best we can to get the win.”Ngwatala admits the appeal to take his game to the next level was a huge factor in his move north of the border after playing in England’s sixth tier for the past three campaigns.As well as playing in front of terrific atmospheres at Dens Park, he is looking forward to testing himself on live television and under the spotlight of big crowds at Parkhead and Ibrox.He went on: “Dundee play in the Premiership so, for me, it was a big step up from playing in the Conference North in England.“It was important for me to move to Scotland and it feels like the right time to make this step.“I want to play at the highest level and going up against Celtic and Rangers is a big deal.“I have to test myself at the highest level.”Ngwatala also heaped praise on boss Neil and the rest of the staff at the club for welcoming him to the fold.The midfield man feels he has settled into the club with ease, though when asked if he has picked up on the local lingo yet, he said: “No, nothing yet!“The training has been nice to be fair, everybody has made me feel very welcome to the club, so it’s good,” he added.“The sessions have been good with the manager.”The Frenchman’s focus now is to show supporters more of what they can expect from him in the new campaign.He added: “I like to get on the ball, create things, make things happen.“Connecting and playing with my team-mates in short spaces is important but sometimes I do like a long shot!”Ngwatala’s new gaffer Neil was delighted his new boys got some valuable minutes under their belts despite drawing in Angus, saying: “I’m not really looking too much into the performances.“It was more just fitness and we had a number of new faces who joined us for the first time on Friday and it’s going to take a wee bit of time to get that understanding.“Overall, I was quite happy with the two 45 minutes.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2a29a52ebfe-668x564.jpg ","title":"paralympian cyclist hannah thanks all who contributed to championship funds","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Paralympic cyclist, who found her passion while studying in Dundee, has crowd-funded enough money to enable her to compete – and also a surplus to help other cyclists.Hannah Dines, 25, who has cerebral palsy, was recently chosen for the Paracycling Road World Championships.

Those taking part are required to eat as many tea cakes as they can in four minutes.It doesn’t end there though – after consuming as many tea cakes as they can stomach, contestants will then be required to drink a can of Irn Bru in 60 seconds.Brechin has hosted the motorcycle festival for a number of years, due to the town being the home of the original Davidson family before they emigrated to the US.As many as 500 bikers are expected to participate in the highlight of the weekend, the Saturday ride-out, which will roar through the town before heading past the restored farm cottage which was once the home of the family which gave its name to the brand.Netherton Cottage, a few miles west of Brechin, was the house from which Sandy and Margaret Davidson emigrated to the US in the mid-19th Century, before their grandsons went on to found the brand.Restored by enthusiasts, the cottage at the roadside between Brechin and Forfar is now a place of pilgrimage for Harley-Davidson enthusiasts from across the globe.Originally established by the Bravo Brechin group, the festival is now led by a team of volunteers. Committee member Dean Walker said: “We got the confirmation yesterday that the tea cake event was going to go ahead.“We got in touch with Tunnocks and this is the first time they are going to do it.“I am going to give it a try but I don’t think I am going to win it.“It is something different on Saturday, a bit of fun for everyone.“I just want as many people to come out and enjoy the festival.“This is for the whole of Angus and we have people coming from all over the world too.“This year will be the biggest festival yet and it will be held over two days.“On the Saturday, Brechin town centre will be closed off and pedestrianised.“This year we are expecting more than 400 bikes and hundreds of Harley-Davidsons to head to Brechin.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3b4ebcc665e.jpg ","title":"travellers urged to abide by the law after plotting up again at camperdown","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA councillors is urging Travellers to make use of sites available to them instead of setting up camp illegally.Caravans have been spotted once again at Camperdown Leisure Park, next to Dundee Ice Arena.A motorhome, a caravan and two cars were parked in the car park across from the venue.Councillor Kevin Keenan, who represents the Strathmartine Ward, said: “I passed at the weekend and noticed them then.“There is a site at Tealing and there was talk of another site that was meant to be at Camperdown Park, essentially a bit fenced off. I know some people were a bit upset by that, as they did see it is giving away part of the park which was gifted to the town. But I suppose it puts people into one area which is designed for that purpose.“I think the idea would be to engage with the Travelling community more, provide skips for them to get rid of their rubbish and in return get some payment from them. Legislation is in place to remove people who camp illegally, and I do think any legislation has to work both ways.”The new camp comes just over a month after Travellers set up in the same location.The group had moved to the site after being evicted from a spot outside Toys R Us at Kingsway West Retail Park.The group had parked outside the store, which closed in April, across disabled bays, and had set up fixtures such as barbecues.The area at Camperdown Leisure Park is not licenced for the purposes of camping, therefore anyone who sets up caravans at the site is doing so against the law.Dundee City Council provides a purpose-built caravan park at Balmuir Wood in Tealing, for up to 20 pitches.Each site has its own utility unit, and a hook-up facility for electricity. The utility units contain a kitchen and a shower, as well as room for storage. There is also a children’s play area.The site is just six miles out of Dundee and has local shops, a doctor’s surgery and a primary school nearby.A Dundee City Council spokeswoman said: “We are aware of the situation and are continuing to monitor it.” A Police Scotland spokesman said the force had not been notified of the group at the leisure park.According to housing charity Shelter Scotland, Travellers staying on private sites can be evicted “fairly easily” by landowners if they do not have permission to be there.The charity said: “If you park up on private land without consent, the owner or legal occupier – for example, a tenant – can take steps to evict you.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/59dc8f56e5322-e1530277496193.jpg ","title":"volunteer drivers needed for dundee charity delivering food to impoverished folk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new charity aimed at alleviating food poverty among families in Dundee is urgently seeking volunteers to carry out its summer programme.Dundee Bairns delivers breakfasts and lunches to impoverished families in the city during the school holidays.It is looking for delivery drivers and attendants to assist with deliveries during its Summer Fun and Food Programme which begins on Monday July 2 and ends on Friday August 11.The charity provides vans so drivers do not need their own car.

It also aims to guarantee that all commitments to suppliers are fulfilled.The Inverness franchise has been held for about the last two years by American Jack Alldredge who is understood to be from Florida.The company\u0027 managing director Mike Williams said Mr Alldredge had hoped to settle in the UK after visiting the country.\"He loved the idea of living here and fell in love with Inverness,\" Mr Williams said.\"But he has had immigration issues. Sometimes we make it difficult for people to invest in this country. It is a shame.\"For the past 18 months, Mr Alldredge has tried to manage the store from America but the shattering of a glass panel in the building \u0026ndash understood to be leased \u0026ndash was the final straw at the beginning of June.\"Fortunately, no one was hurt,\" Mr Williams said.\u0026nbsp\"In our 18-year history, we have never closed a store apart from relocation so it is sad that after the roof \u0026lsquoexploded\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash which was a glass entrance, leaving a very dangerous situation with other panels \u0026ndash Jack decided to call it a day.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMr Williams said he was disappointed for Mr Alldredge as well as the store\u0027 three employees including a manager.As the store was operated as a franchise, Ableworld is not obliged to step in but it is aiming to honour commitments to suppliers and customers.\"Although saddened by the situation, Ableworld will ensure that all suppliers of stock to the company will not lose out and either Highland Mobility (Ableworld Inverness) will settle all accounts or Ableworld UK will satisfy all the suppliers,\" Mr Williams said.\"Also no customer will lose out on their present deposits or product delivery of orders.\"Ableworld will be setting up support networks for past customers of products and writing to customers explaining the situation.\"Too many businesses in our industry and others pull the plug and leave their customers and suppliers high and dry which is something we will not do.\"He also revealed the company was actively looking to open another franchise in the Inverness area.Inverness MP Drew Hendry said the store\u0027 closure would be a great loss to many disabled people. Citing the high-profile case of city guesthouse owners Russell and Ellen Felber who are fighting deportation to America, Mr Hendry said this was another example of how immigration policies were not working.\u0026nbsp\"I am already working with countless other local families facing a similar fate, including the Felbers whose ongoing battle to stay in Inverness is utterly heart-breaking,\" Mr Hendry said.Inverness disability rights campaigner David Sansum said there were few mobility aid suppliers in the city while the next nearest store was about 40 miles away in Forres.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"I\u0026rsquom sure the closure of Ableworld will leave a big gap,\" he said. \"It is shame.\"\u0026nbspIn recent months, there have been a spate of incidents at Inverness retail parks where glass panels have fallen from overhead canopies.In March, Highland Council urged building owners with glazed canopies to check adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements were in place while Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans called for glass panels to be removed from canopies at all the city\u0027 retail parks.Wednesday 4 Jul 2018 11:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/01828000/01828031.jpg","title":"Druim Ba wind farm rejected","story":"Plans for 10 turbines at Druim Ba between Kiltarlity and Abriachan have been rejected today by the Scottish Government after a second public inquiry.\u0026nbspGeneral wind farm campaigner Lyndsey Ward was \"delighted\"She said: \"The community has had seven years of wind farm developers trying to get a wind farm in that area.

due to start on Monday.Other roads across the city \u0026ndash including Midmills Road in the Crown area and Caledonian Road and Montague Row in Dalneigh are also set to have their potholes filled in.But Ness-side councillor Ron MacWilliam has called for a rethink on the way damaged roads are prioritised.At present, funds are allocated according to a formula which gives more weighting to length of road than traffic volumes.As a result, Mr MacWilliam said roads in Inverness were having less money spent on them than rural roads in the far north of Sutherland. He also said more needed to be done if city drivers were going to notice any significant difference.\"The fact the council is now looking to repair roads within the city is a start, but there are a lot of routes \u0026ndash particularly in areas such as Hilton and Lochardil \u0026ndash which are still very bad,\" he told the Courier.\"The roads budget is woefully inadequate. The roads office has a fantastic team but they are fighting a losing battle.\"With regards to the funding formula, Mr MacWilliam said he was continuing to press the matter but he faced strong opposition from the much larger number of Highland councillors who represent rural wards.However, residents in Milton Crescent are just happy that work there is finally going ahead.Edward Dyce (76) relies on his vehicle to get around and said: \"I have had a lot of problems with my car because of the road surface. It\u0027 getting worse because of the amount of traffic.\"A lot of people use the road and the potholes have become a real problem.

get into hostel dorm","story":"\u0026nbspA WOMEN\u0026rsquoS rights group has expressed concerns for the safety of guests staying at a Highland hostel after one of its bloggers was able to book herself into a male-only dormitory.Inverness Youth Hostel in Victoria Drive allowed Trina Budge to stay in a men\u0027 room after she told a receptionist she self-identified as a man.She went on to write a blog post about her stay and said she is concerned women could be at risk as a result of people taking advantage of the self-determination policy.She said: \"There are huge concerns over safety. When you book a single-sex room at a hostel you expect it to be exactly that.\"We are not anti-transgender but we are concerned there are people who will take advantage of the policy.\"There\u0027 a danger that people who are genuinely transgender will become scapegoats because of people who abuse the policy.\"I have emailed Hostelling Scotland with regard to what happened and have asked to discuss with them how they plan to protect the needs of all their guests.\"Mrs Budge\u0027 blog post included a screenshot of an email in which the hostel revealed it did not have \"a specific transgender policy\" but would book accommodation \"based on how our guests choose to be recognised\".A spokeswoman for the Highland LGBT Forum said: \"The hostel decided to take her at her word. I don\u0026rsquot think that was the correct decision.\"A person who identifies as a specific gender will always try and present themselves as such.\"This woman found a loophole in the way the hostel treats transgender people. It\u0027 a difficult problem, and the youth hostel need to look into it.\"The important thing that stuck out in the original blog post was that Hostelling Scotland does not have a specific transgender policy.\"They allocate rooms based on how guests choose to be identified but people who genuinely are transgender will present themselves as the gender they wish to be recognised as.\"Despite the incident, Hostelling Scotland insisted that it will maintain its policy.A spokesman said: \"Hostelling Scotland is an organisation open to all and we treat all our guests with respect and dignity.

Milne said: “This is one of the most important occasions for the club.“What we are going to embark upon over the next three to four years is this facility and then move on to the stadium.“That is really going to transform the club and set us up on a fantastic basis to move into the next period.“To finally get on site and see the diggers working is a massive day for the football club.“I am very proud that we have achieved that.”Aberdeen put the application for the £50m stadium and training facility on hold last October as they wanted more time to discuss the matter with planners.In January the plans were approved by councillors when members voted 32 to nine in favour of the application to build the new stadium and training facilities.“It has been a long, frustrating journey, the best part of 20 years that we have been trying to get a site for a new stadium and the much-needed training facilities,” said Milne.“At times you feel you are making progress and then for whatever reason things grind to a halt.“The fact this is the third site we have actually got planning permission for speaks for itself.“The other two we got the consents but for various reasons outwith the club’s control we weren’t able to go ahead with them.”The first phase of the £50m development will include the construction of the training pavilion, groundsman’s accommodation, three professional training pitches, two 3G pitches and two grass pitches.Milne confirmed the full £10m has yet to be secured but he is confident of raising the funds.He said: “We still have work to do to get the balance of the funding in place.“But we are confident that one way or another we will get that lined up.“Everyone knows it has been a really challenging last few years economically for everyone in the region.“It is not the ideal time to be raising funds but one way or another we will get that.”The No Kingsford Stadium protest group are pursuing a judicial review in a bid to stop the project going ahead.Aberdeen-based McIntosh Plant Hire now have the go- ahead to begin the initial earthworks and ground remediation in preparation for the building work, which is scheduled to start in October.Milne said: “This is the start of delivering the much-needed facilities for the club.“Hopefully this time next year we will be standing here and seeing the first phase come into completion.“Seeing the guys come back for their pre-season training next year with their base here will be absolutely fantastic.”Following the completion of the training complex the Reds will then have to secure the £40m for the stadium, which is scheduled for completion in 2021.At the club’s AGM last December Milne confirmed the sale of Pittodrie would raise 40% of the £40m, i.e. £16m.That still leaves a £24m shortfall.Milne said: “Once the first phase is delivered we will have to step back and take a deep breath before we tackle the stadium.“That will be a major challenge to raise all the funds that are required for that.“If we can deliver the first phase it will be a massive step forward.”Aberdeen are now the official owners of the 25-hectare site at Kingsford and contracts are due to be agreed in the coming weeks for work such as pavilion construction and the formation of the pitches.It is now almost two decades since Aberdeen first announced their intention to move from Pittodrie in January 1999.The club had earmarked a site on the road between Aberdeen and Kingswells to become the new home for the Dons.Planning consent was eventually granted, but on the condition that the Scottish FA were successful with a bid to host the Euro 2008 finals.When the Euro bid failed, so did the proposal.Aberdeen also planned on a move to a stadium at Loirston, but with an additional smaller stadium at Calder Park. But in August 2012 city councillors voted by 24-19 to retain control of Calder Park.Then aspirations to house the training complex at Balgownie, Bridge of Don, collapsed in 2015.Throughout all those setbacks Milne never gave up hope of delivering a state-of-the-art training complex.“You always have to believe that you will get there in the end,” he said.“It would be easy to give up when you keep hitting brick walls and are thinking you are not going to get there.“But we have a lot of good people around us as part of the team over the years and they have been a good driving force as well.“This is a reward for an awful lot of people who have put hard work in including Derek (McInnes), who has played a key role in helping us get consent.“He hasn’t just stayed there in the background to wait and see what happened.“He took very much a forward role in the whole thing and that has been very beneficial to us.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen park car park to shut for resurfacing","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe car park at a popular Aberdeen park will be shut for two days this week.Duthie Park\u0026#8217s Riverside Drive car park will be closed tomorrow and Friday for resurfacing work.Visitors to the park are still able to park on Great Southern Road, beside Allenvale Cemetery and also on Riverside Drive.Aberdeen City Council are also reminding people that motorists should not park on the grass or in any other areas outside the designated parking spaces or they could be issued with a ticket.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeens boozy cow to reopen under new name after major refurb1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPopular Aberdeen bar and restaurant The Boozy Cow is to reopen this summer under a new name next month.The venue will reopen under the name The Spiritualist and will under go an extensive refurbishment.It will include a food and drinks menu filled with cocktails, craft beers and a selection of wines and will be serving breakfast, lunch, dinner and drinks.Signature Pubs, the company behind the new eatery, has also vowed to support local suppliers by using their produce.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"first speakeasy in city set to bring spirit of jazz age1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen’s first-ever speakeasy is to open in the autumn after councillors gave the green light.PB Devco, which runs eight venues across Aberdeen, will launch the 21 Crimes “secret” bar at the former Filling Station premises on Union Street in late autumn.The bar – named after the number of offences that would result in deportation to Australia in the 1920s – will be at basement level and a grill house restaurant called Vovem will be on the ground floor.The project took a step forward yesterday when Aberdeen City Council’s licensing board met to grant the premises a licence.It means the bar can open until 3am at weekends. NHS Grampian asked PB Devco to explain how the premises would fulfil the licensing requirement of providing “significant entertainment”.In a letter to the board, NHS Grampian’s public health consultant Dr Tara Shivaji said: “I understand the basement bar will possibly be themed as a prohibition/1920s type premises with jazz, informal and recorded music provided.“The entertainment on offer at these premises would appear to be low key.”However, according to licensing board member Councillor David Cameron, PB Devco successfully argued at the meeting the bar itself would be a draw.“They put forward a very convincing argument and the idea of a secret bar with hidden entrances is very clever,” said Mr Cameron.He added: “Most importantly, they made a well-rounded argument to address all the concerns of NHS Grampian and the police.”PB Devco operations director Paul Clarkson said: “We are delighted with the licensing board’s decision.“It is great news. The venue will be exciting, though we want to keep certain details under wraps for now. It will create between 30 and 40 jobs and will be something completely new for Aberdeen.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/EE2_Meerkats-07.jpg-525x564.jpg ","title":"meerkat2","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA beloved meerkat which helped boost visitor numbers at an Aberdeen petting zoo has passed away.Don, who arrived at Hazlehead Park’s Pets Corner last July, died on Thursday.The cause of the cute critter’s death is currently unknown but Aberdeen City Council, which owns the attraction, said a post-mortem examination would be carried out.Its operational delivery convener John Wheeler paid tribute to the “hugely popular” meerkat, who was around one year old.He said: “We are very sad to have to report that Don the meerkat passed away on Thursday.“Earlier in the day, staff noticed that Don was unwell, and they took him to the vet, however, he died a short time later.\u0026#8221A post-mortem has established Don died of a hole in the heart.Don was hugely popular with visitors to Pets Corner at Hazlehead Park along with fellow meerkat Dee.Meantime, council staff are trying to source another meerkat so Dee isn’t on her own for too long.Male Don moved to Pets Corner just under a year ago, along with female Dee – the duo were named by local primary school pupils.They arrived following a £750,000 renovation and helped set a new record day for visitors with 1,640 heading through the attraction’s doors on July 8 last year.Other animals at the facility – which has been a firm favourite with Aberdeen families for more than five decades – include alpacas, kune kune pigs, geese, turkey, chickens, sheep, goats, a Shetland pony, miniature donkeys, fish, reptiles, budgies, ducks, finches, chipmunks, guinea fowl, ferrets, rabbits, chinchilla, guinea pigs, Vader the Burmese python and Gethin the pygmy goat.As part of last year’s renovation works the council replaced the roof, undertook internal alterations and installed new fish and reptile tanks, a new external access ramp and paths, and an upgrade to the staff facilities.An education room was also added.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"musicians praise for service which put him on road to recovery","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen musician who battled cancer today praised the NHS and its staff.Sean McBain, 34, from Torry, was 20 years old at the time he found a lump on his tongue that turned out to be tongue cancer.He said: “I was diagnosed with cancer in the tongue back in 2003.“From diagnosis to operation the service was professional, comforting and above all fast.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This is the same distance Mark averaged every day during his epic cycle round the world in 80 days last year.In other words the team of 80 intrepid cyclists will pedal the equivalent of Mark’s incredible feat – taking them around the world in a day.Participants are asked to raise a minimum of £240 each for the STV Children’s Appeal, which supports children and young people affected by poverty in Scotland, with the hope of raising as much as £80,000 for the charity.Mark said: \u0026#8216This stunning route from Argyll to Aberdeen was my last 16-hour training ride before I set out on the world challenge and it holds fond memories \u0026#8211 but it is very long and very hilly, so I’ll be impressed by everyone who signs up for this epic day of endurance.\u0026#8216The STV Children’s Appeal has gone from strength from strength, supporting so many brilliant charities and causes across Scotland. The last time I crossed Scotland for the appeal I was swimming and running, so cycling has to be easier… right?\u0026#8217He added: \u0026#8216Thanks to everyone who gets involved and I look forward to riding with you.\u0026#8217Mari Slavin of the STV Children’s Appeal said: \u0026#8216Mark is a fantastic ambassador for the Appeal and we are all in awe of the gigantic challenge he’s about to take on, together with cyclists from across the country. STV’s cameras will be there – and trying hard to keep up! – to capture the highs and lows of this incredible marathon venture\u0026#8217After a 4am start in Argyll, Mark’s 240-mile cycle route will pass through Tarbert, Ardrishaig, Lochgilphead, Inveraray, Tyndrum, Crainlarich, Killin, Aberfeldy, Pitlochry, Glenshee, Braemar, Ballater and Peterculter \u0026#8211 among many other towns and villages \u0026#8211 before finishing in Aberdeen.If you think you’re up for this epic feat of endurance, get in touch with Mark on aroundtheworld@thehunterfoundationA corporate offer is also available with four-person relay teams invited to enter for a minimum donation of £5,000.Can’t face the cycle but still want to be involved?

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

Jorja was the top Mid Argyll girl in the long jump reaching 3.03 metres and also had a respectable 10.55 metres throw with the 500g turbo javelin.The girls B team finished ahead of the A team in 28th overall, mainly due to an excellent 14.25 metres javelin throw by Sophie Balkeen. This throw ensured fifth place overall for Sophie out of almost 200 girls and the points gained allowed the B team to finish above the A team. The A team finished only half a second ahead of the B team in the 4 x 100 metres relay. The B team consisted of Maisie Gilmour and Jodie Allan from Ardrishaig, Sophie Balkeen from Lochgair and Erin Naisby from Furnace.The girls contest was won by Law and District.This national competition was a great experience, not just for the young athletes competing in the big arena, but also for the supportive parents who provided transport on the day.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"picts and vikings in focus for strachur youth drama club","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/07/18, 7:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowStrachur Youth and Drama Club\u0026#8217s summer film school is back this year.The young filmmakers are blazing a trail around the Cowal peninsula to create a historical adventure movie made up of early Celts, Picts, Scotti and Vikings.Club founder Sheena Dowse said: ‘We are following the path of early settlers and telling their stories of faith, bravery, family and determination to survive in the breathtaking wilderness that was Scotland\u0026#8217s west coast 1,000 years ago.’The programme gives opportunities to explore filmmaking, from the technicalities of visual and audio, to creating costumes or sets.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"watch-glorious-sunshine-marks-the-start-of-a-braw-week","story":"THERE couldn\u0026rsquot have been a more perfect evening to kick-off the biggest week in Galashiels\u0026rsquo calendar.\nThe Braw Lads\u0026rsquo Gathering has already seen a packed schedule with Spurs Night, Threepwood and the Braw Lads\u0026rsquo Sports Day all taking place to name just a few.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    callback: function() {        RelatedArticleBlock.init(false)    },    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716333168,16332304,16332276,16332071,16331864\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since.

However, the highlight was riding up the Bealach na B\u0026agrave. This is every road biker\u0026rsquos dream climb, and to be able to ride it in the heat was a treat.\n\u0026ldquoThe Bealach na B\u0026agrave is a notorious mountain pass to Applecross.

closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep. It\u0026rsquos just amazing to see how some of them react.\"\nHaving embraced meditation and its healing benefits, I leave the studio feeling renewed, carefree and a little lighter on my feet.

window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit

\u0026#8216Well Done\u0026#8217 award from the US Air Force for safely handling an \u0026#8216extremely hazardous\u0026#8217 incident at low altitude over Kintyre last year.First Lieutenant David Loveless and Captain Michael Good were flying at low level in one of a formation of three F-111 fighter-bombers when their left engine exploded. The formation had been flying over the west of Scotland for ten minutes when the incident occurred.Lieutenant Loveless climbed the aircraft to a safe altitude and the crew prepared for an emergency single-engined landing at the nearest suitable base which was Machrihanish.According to the citation, Lieutenant Loveless flew a \u0026#8216flawless\u0026#8217 single-engined approach.Guided by RAF radar controllers at Machrihanish, the aircraft emerged from the cloud at 800 feet and made a safe landing.FIFTY YEARS AGOThursday June 27, 1968Stowaway on the DuchessFor what is believed to be the first time ever, the T.S. \u0026#8216Duchess of Hamilton\u0026#8217 turned back to Campbeltown on its outward journey on Sunday.The reason? On board was an eight-year-old Campbeltown \u0026#8216stowaway\u0026#8217.The youngster, Freddy Mathisen, had been at the pier watching the steamer and had gone aboard while she was berthed at the Old Quay.Freddy explored the vessel and for some reason didn\u0026#8217t notice the steamer getting underway. Indeed, the turbine was abreast of Trench Point when a tearful Freddy \u0026#8216gave himself up\u0026#8217 to a ship\u0026#8217s officer.The orders were given for the vessel to turn around and head back for the Old Quay where a crowd had gathered.Two pairs of brawn arms lifted Freddy ashore and the boat got up steam once more.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSaturday June 29, 1918Wedding of Miss Graham of SkipnessOn Saturday June 22, a marriage was celebrated in St. Brendan\u0026#8217s Church, Skipness, between Mr Robin George Collingwood of the Naval Staff Intelligence Division and Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, and Miss Ethel Winifred Graham, youngest daughter of the late R.C. Graham Esq. of Skipness.The little church, decorated with white marguerites and ferns picked by the children attending Skipness school, was full of friendly well-wishers, many of whom had known the bride from her infancy.The bride wore a simple white georgette gown trimmed with Italian lace given by her aunt, Lady Monkswell, and a veil of old Brussels lace over a wreath of small white roses.Round her neck was a necklace of lapis lazuli and gold, the gift of her brother, Mr R.F. Graham, and she carried a large bouquet of wild flowers, gathered by the boys of the place.She was attended by seven little girls from the village as bridesmaids.In spite of the war and the tempestuous weather, many flags had appeared and the village was gay with sunshine, flowers and bunting as Mr and Mrs R.G. Collingswood drove away amid universal good wishes, to Claonaig Lodge for their honeymoon.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pounds for green fingered pupils plants","story":"Last Thursday P4/5 held its annual \u0026#8216Go Green Day’ event in the school gym and sold many of the plants grown by green-fingered pupils.A report from teacher Alison Semple read: \u0026#8216In preparation all pupils planted and grew a variety of plants and flowers to sell, enhancing their existing knowledge and understanding of the planting process and developing their gardening skills.\u0026#8217On the day, pupils wore green items of clothing or accessories to further promote the event.Miss Semple added: \u0026#8216In addition they created items using recycled goods, made beautiful flower arrangements with the help of the talented Mrs Lorna McKinven and Mrs Irene Millar, produced ‘Green themed’ baking goods, made fruit kebabs in pots,  held a bric-a-brac stall,  ‘ECO themed games stalls  and much more.\u0026#8216We were extremely lucky to have received fabulous donations from Fresh Connection, Saddell Nurseries, Auchencorvie Sawmill, Gordon Allen, Tesco, Co-op, Glenbarr Nursery and The Factory Shop.\u0026#8216Everybody would like to say a huge thankyou to these organisations for the donations and also to the teachers, parents and staff who contributed, to make this event extremely successful.\u0026#8216The day raised £409 in a short period of time and the raffle winner was Mrs Blanchflower who won a beautiful bunch of flowers and bird house.\u0026#8216All proceeds will go to our ECO fund to help further develop the school garden area and outdoor learning resources ultimately enhancing children\u0026#8217s experiences and environment.\u0026#8217P5\u0026#8217s Laura Ondova, Gemma McCaig and Emma Oman sold Minion\u0026#8217s hair novelties for five pence.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity.

Inspectors found the following strengths in the school\u0027s work:  - Strong relationships exist between staff and children across the school and nursery which are based on shared values  - In the nursery, children are motivated and confident, and are able to make choices about their play, particularly outdoors. Across the primary stages, children are committed to and proud of being part of their school community  - The committed staff team, led by the headteacher, work well together in their goal to secure positive outcomes for children. Wellbeing is central to the whole school community and staff provide a nurturing learning environment where children receive effective support.  Areas for improvement were identified and discussed with the headteacher and a representative from East Lothian Council.  They were:  - Increasing the opportunities for children to be more active and independent in their learning  - Continuing to improve attainment, ensuring that the pace and challenge of learning meets the needs of all children  - Continuing to develop the opportunities for leadership at all levels to support the school improvement. Increasing the scope for all members of the school community, including parents, partners and children, to be involved in discussions about aspects of the life and work of the school.

She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.

The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is.

Residents such as Seona Mason-Chadburn, who lives in Dunbar town centre, contacted the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and Tarmac, which operates Dunbar Cement Plant to the south-east of the town, about the discharge.  She told the Courier how she had attempted to use her window wipers to clear her front windscreen, only to discover the dust.  She said her windscreen felt like \u0026ldquosandpaper and compared the dust to the \u0026ldquobloom on a black grape.  A spokesman for SEPA added: \u0026ldquoEvery day SEPA works to protect and enhance Scotland\u0026rsquos environment and we are clear that compliance is non-negotiable.  \u0026ldquoIn response to local complaints, SEPA officers responded to reports of significant dust in the Dunbar area.  \u0026ldquoOfficers identified the source of the dust and are working with Tarmac to prevent a re-occurrence.  \u0026ldquoWe would advise members of the public to contact our 24-hour pollution hotline on 0800 807060 to report pollution events.  Tarmac has confirmed that the dust escaped, with an internal investigation being carried out.  Oliver Curtin, plant manager, said: \u0026ldquoIn the early hours of May 24 we experienced an isolated and brief incident where a small amount of limestone-based dust escaped from the site.  \u0026ldquoWe took action quickly and have been working with SEPA and conducting our own investigations to prevent a recurrence. We\u0026rsquore committed to minimising our environmental impact and apologise for any inconvenience caused. If anyone has any concerns or queries they can contact us at dunbar.feedback@tarmac  The incident took place when some clinker (nodules of cement) was being loaded into a store.  As soon as the discharge was detected, the process was \u0026ldquoimmediately shut down but \u0026ldquounfortunately some dust had already escaped into the atmosphere, said Tarmac.  The dry weather and wind direction resulted in the dust being carried towards Dunbar.  Tarmac has sent out a letter to residents and offered to arrange for cars to be washed at the company\u0026rsquos expense.

Councillor McMillan said it had been a great honour to be joined by veterans from East Lothian at the flag-raising ceremony which took place on Monday morning.  He told those in attendance: \"Today is an opportunity to recognise the enormous contribution made by service personnel - past and present - and pay tribute to those who very sadly paid the ultimate sacrifice.  \"This November marks a century since the end of the First World War. A large number of residents left East Lothian in service of their country \u0026ndash many of whom, tragically, would never return.  \"Sadly, in the 100 years since, the world has seen all too many conflicts \u0026ndash some on a large scale, others more confined. In war, and in peacetime, our armed forces have promoted peace and security, confronted terrorism, and delivered aid to those in need.  \"That\u0026rsquos why, as Provost of East Lothian, I value occasions such as Armed Forces Day. A chance to give thanks, remember, reflect and look ahead.\"  Mr McMillan also paid tribute to the role of women in the military and in times of conflict, noting that 2018 was also the 100th anniversary of the first women being given the vote.  He said: \"Women played a significant role in the war effort, taking on work such as farming, transport and munition production, and the perseverance of Suffrage activity subsequently led to women being given the right to vote.  \"For a number of years now women have deservedly been playing a full and active role in our Armed Forces \u0026ndash reflective of the increasingly inclusive society in which we all live and are so keen to protect.\"  Veterans who attended the ceremony on Monday were invited to enjoy refreshments after the event."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7979931.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotlands-best-black-pudding-made-in-east-lothian","story":"  When the final of this year\u0026rsquos Scottish Black Pudding Championship was held earlier this month at the Edinburgh New Town Cook School, it was Anderson\u0027s Quality Butchers who came out on top.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8006789.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coast-road-closed-after-car-overturns","story":"  Police said one person was trapped in a car which has overturned and they have closed the road while work to free them is carried out.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.

The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.

A group of nerve agents which are more potent and lethal than VX or sarin.  They are made of two separate non-toxic substances that work as a nerve agent when brought together.  Dr Andrea Sella, professor of inorganic chemistry at University College London, said: \u0026ldquoNovichok is not really very different from all the classics, you\u0026rsquove got the same basic chemical framework at the heart of it.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not sure it\u0026rsquos ever really been used. There\u0026rsquos not much experience of seeing these things, they would have recognised it was some sort of nerve agent, which is part of the reason for the delay [in identifying it].  \u0026ndash Why was it created?  Novichok, which means newcomer in Russian, was developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s as a new kind of chemical weapon that would be harder to detect, more potent than existing nerve agents and exempt from the Chemical Weapons Treaty.  Dr Sella said: \u0026ldquoNovichok agents are ones that were kept very quiet by the Russians and developed to try and gain advantage against the more conventional things they knew Western governments had.  \u0026ndash How does it work?  Novichok and other nerve agents attack the nervous system and stop chemical messages getting around the body.  They cause the heart to slow down and airways to become constricted, leading to suffocation or brain damage.  \u0026ldquoIt must be excruciatingly painful and unbelievably violent, Dr Sella said.  \u0026ldquoYou have very painful muscle contractions, vision goes pretty quickly and what little you can see is blurred, then you can\u0026rsquot breathe.  \u0026ndash What are the symptoms?  Nerve agents, including Novichok, can be inhaled as a fine powder, absorbed through the skin or ingested.  Symptoms can start within seconds or minutes of being exposed and include convulsions, paralysis, respiratory failure and death.  \u0026ndash How can it be treated?  The treatment for nerve agents is to administer an antidote immediately, but some of the damage from the chemical and oxygen starvation can be irreparable.  It is not known if there is an antidote available for Novichok."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7627290.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"annie-lennox-is-installed-as-glasgow-caledonian-university-chancellor","story":"  The highly-respected social activist and philanthropist pledged to use her ceremonial leadership role to further the university\u0026rsquos mission to promote the common good, during a special ceremony in the City Centre.

In another place, another time, Love and Money could have been the biggest band in the world.  7 \u0026ndash If You\u0026rsquore Feeling Sinister, Belle and Sebastian, 1996    Second albums are supposed to be difficult but Belle and Sebastian arguably never surpassed the stunning collection of songs that comprised their sophomore effort, giving a masterclass in how to mix melody, melancholy, nostalgia and humour.  6 \u0026ndash Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991    The album that thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is This Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  5 \u0026ndash Heaven Or Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990    Elizabeth Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest musical pleasures and treasures, and this most accessible of Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is simply awash with blissed-out grandeur. Could they really have been from Grangemouth? Oh yes.  4 \u0026ndash A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984    Sounding nothing like anything else that came out of Scotland, the UK or indeed anywhere else in 1984, this debut fused spare synth precision with exuberant vocal sincerity to stunning effect. Tinseltown in the Rain, that bittersweet slice of cinematic perfection, remains the ultimate ode to Glasgow.  3 \u0026ndash The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008    Since Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos untimely death in May, listening to the music he and his bandmates created has been a particularly sad and difficult task. But this album is simply too good to stop listening to. Revisiting is painful but cathartic, and like all of the \u0026nbspHutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.\u0026nbsp  2 \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, The Trashcan Sinatras, 1993    From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  1 \u0026ndash Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989    Only seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. For almost 30 years it has offered endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  Here\u0027s what you said about Hats:  Christine Gardner, Rotterdam: Head and shoulders above the rest. A magnificent album that I continue to listen to regularly after almost 30 years. It is quite simply a masterpiece. It continues to draw you in, delight your senses, touch your emotions and somehow mirror your own very personal experiences. And yet it is also essentially Scottish \u0026ndash maybe something to do with our collective psyche, despite all our individual differences.  Martin McCarthy: Hats has so many layers, from dreamy songs like Over the Hillside and Let\u0026rsquos Go Out Tonight to more upbeat songs like Headlights on the Parade and \u0026ldquoThe Downtown Lights.  Saturday Night is just a sublime song, I love the pitch perfect bass, the stunning keyboards and Paul Buchanan\u0027s emotional voice. This was played at our wedding to a full dancefloor and will always be so special. The songs on Hats convey love, beauty, pain and loss, and can push me to tears of utter joy and euphoria.  Alex Watkins: It\u0026rsquos the album I always return to just something about the memories and emotions it always conjures up.  Kevin Jackson: Hats is the best album ever recorded anywhere by anyone. It touches you in a way that others must stand back in awe and adoration of. It is a thing of perfection. When some of the finest innovative talents of our time see it as one of the greatest albums ever, it is because it has no peers.  Peter Morgan: I\u0027m going to plump for Hats, that lush, aching, bruised and battered homage to love and loss.  John Reader: I listen to a lot of music, including lots of new stuff but always have Hats on at some point every week. Still hooks me in with its lush simplicity. I remember saying to someone more than 25 years ago that of all the music around at that time I reckoned I\u0027d be listening to Hats for the rest of my life. Not wrong so far.  Colin Lunn: I love A Walk Across the Rooftops, the best first album by any group, not only in Scotland but worldwide. However, Hats was probably a better, more perfect album although it didn\u0026rsquot have the same influence. Tough, tough choice but I\u0026rsquoll go for Hats by a very, very fine margin.  Here\u0026rsquos what you had to say about some of the other music on the list:  Kyle Wallace: I\u0027ve Seen Everything by the Trashcan Sinatras is part of the soundtrack to my life. Listened to it through my dad\u0027s death and the college years. So many great songs associated with great memories.  John Richards: This was a very difficult choice. Scottish groups (I\u0027m Welsh) have a disproportionately large place in my music collection \u0026ndash particularly those who came to prominence in the 1980s. My top 20 regularly features the work of the Blue Nile, Danny Wilson, Aztec Camera, Deacon Blue and Love \u0026amp Money. However, it\u0027s got to be an album from the year I turned 19, when I went to university and the myriad possibilities that life had to offer opened up before me. The song (and album) that soundtracked that life-changing period is still my favourite Scottish album: Strange Kind of Love by Love \u0026amp Money.  Stuart Duncan: My vote is for The Midnight Organ Fight by Frightened Rabbit. An album that, as your writer said, \u0026ldquomakes it feel it\u0026rsquos OK to be sad. The lyrics hit home more than any album I\u0026rsquove ever listened to. Scott Hutchison gave me a feeling that everything was going to be OK, that I would get through things. I\u0026rsquod say he helped changed me as a person. It still hasn\u0026rsquot stuck in that he\u0026rsquos no longer here [Hutchsion took his own life in May] but my vote would be the same regardless of the circumstances.  Danny Tennyson: My favourite album by a Scottish band \u0026ndash or any other band for that matter \u0026ndash has to High Land Hard Rain, by Aztec Camera. The fact that Roddy was probably only 15 or 16 when he wrote most of the tracks for the album makes it all the more remarkable. He continues to be a genius to this day.  Shane Brown, Illinois: Why is it that I live in the centre boring part of America (the states you fly over to get somewhere else interesting), and should by location and birthright be a huge fan of Slipknot, but instead find myself with a vast collection of Scottish indiepop? From the Cocteaus to the Fannies, Belle \u0026amp Sebastian to Teen Canteen, Scottish indiepop has been the soundtrack to my life. How and why the music of your land speaks to me, I\u0027ll never know, but no album speaks to my soul more than Cake by the Trashcan Sinatras \u0026ndash a record I find as comforting as a cup of coffee on a cold winter morning. I really, really love it to this day, and why those lads aren\u0027t universally revered as musical genius is beyond me to this day. I\u0027ve travelled hundreds of miles to see them live and I\u0027ll continue to do so as long as they grace us with the occasional American tour.  John Jauchler, Connecticut: Lots of good stuff on your list, but my vote goes to the Trashcan Sinatras\u0026rsquo I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything. Outstanding musicians and really nice guys as well. Their music has made a difference in my life.

It seeks to overhaul the current system \u0026ldquobased on fishing patterns from the 1970s, where EU states land eight times as much fish in UK waters as British vessels do in EU seas.  And it will set out a number of methods to explore \u0026ldquofairer allocation of fishing opportunities, such as zonal attachment \u0026ndash a system which would take the distribution of fish in national waters into account.  This would lead to a radical shake-up of the current system which reflects historic fishing patterns. British waters currently contain 88 per cent of adult North Sea herring, one of Europe\u0026rsquos most popular fish.  Mr Gove\u0026rsquos White Paper is expected to address concerns fishing could be used as a \u0026ldquobargaining chip in Brexit negotiations by making clear that market access for fisheries products is separate to the question of fishing opportunities and access to waters.  He said leaving the EU \u0026ldquocreates a sea of opportunity for our fishing industry in Scotland.  He added: \u0026ldquoOutside the Common Fisheries Policy we can take back control of our waters and revitalise our coastal communities.\"  But Scottish ministers raised \u0026ldquosignificant concerns over the proposals \u0026ndash which include charging for fish caught in excess of quotas \u0026ndash and slammed the UK Government for failing to engage, insisting they were only handed a copy of the final report days before publication.  Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: \u0026ldquoIt is deeply frustrating that once again the UK Government has failed to substantively engage with us while developing its future fisheries proposals.  \u0026ldquoThis near lack of formal engagement presents a significant and continued risk to the current devolved settlements and is totally unacceptable.  He said fishing is fully devolved, and insisted he would \u0026ldquoresolutely oppose any attempt to interfere with the established powers of the Scottish Parliament, the Scottish zone or Scottish vessels wherever they operate.  Until plans for a transition period, the UK will continue to follow EU fishing rules until 2020.  Mr Gove said the UK would end the \u0026ldquowasteful discarding of fish after Brexit and and make clear vessels will only be allowed to fish in British waters if they adhere to high sustainability standards.  His paper will also commit to publishing an annual statement setting out the health of fish stocks.  Meanwhile, access to waters and fishing opportunities would be negotiated on an annual basis, mirroring the approach taken in countries such as Norway.  Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen\u0026rsquos Federation, welcomed the blueprint but said governments now needed to show \u0026ldquoreal backbone to ensure the aspirations become reality."},{"url":null,"title":"google-confirms-third-party-developers-can-read-gmail-messages","story":"  Questions have been raised by reports in the US about the level of data that can be accessed and how aware people are that they are agreeing to share private emails.

Votes on motions linked to public spending could only take place from 7pm - the kick-off time for England\u0027s second round tie.  Five votes occurred, including one regarding devolution, and took approximately 66 minutes.  Mr Blackford insisted the Government was responsible for the timetable and the votes represented the SNP\u0027s only opportunity to \"speak out against the continued austerity\".  He also highlighted his party were acting on their vow to use parliamentary procedure to oppose the Government \"every inch of the way\" following a row last month over the lack of time to discuss Brexit matters linked to the Scottish Parliament, branded a \"power grab\" by the SNP.

According to Westminster\u0026rsquos register of members\u0026rsquo interest, the SUAT gave \u0026pound7500 to both Banff \u0026amp Buchan MP David Duguid and Moray MP Douglas Ross last year.

He is due to arrive in Scotland on Tuesday following a meeting with Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez on Monday, according to Prof Ponsati\u0027s lawyer Aamer Anwar.  He will meet with Prof Ponsati before joining the First Minister at her official residence, Bute House in Edinburgh, on Wednesday, Mr Anwar said.  Mr Torra\u0027s visit will follow the latest procedural hearing for Prof Ponsati\u0027s case at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Thursday this week.  It comes ahead of a four-week hearing scheduled to take place in the summer.  Prof Ponsati\u0027s legal team, who describe the prosecution as \"politically motivated\" by Spain, say she could face a total sentence of up to 33 years if she is sent there and convicted of the charges, raising fears the 61-year-old could spend the rest of her life in jail.  Her team maintains that the condition of \"dual criminality\" - the issue of establishing equivalent charges in Scots law - is not fulfilled, and a European arrest warrant should not be executed.  However Mr Anwar said the Advocate Depute, acting on behalf of Spain, has advised she faces the equivalent charge of treason in Scots law.  He said: \"Clara Ponsati maintains her innocence of the charges and our instructions remain to robustly defend her from extradition to Spain.  \"Clara regards it as surreal that she is now accused of treason, when the Spanish state blames the Catalan government for executing a law that was voted on in the Catalan Parliament elected by the Catalan people.  \"From the very beginning we have submitted that the condition of dual criminality is not fulfilled in Scotland, and the European arrest warrants should not be executed.\"  A Crown Office spokesman said: \"In extradition cases in Scotland, the Crown is required by statute to act on behalf of the requesting state or territory.  \"Once proceedings are active, any question as to the progress of the case is a matter for the court. As this case is active, it would not be appropriate for the Crown to comment further.  \"All proceedings are open to the public and press.\""},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-pubs-get-extra-drinking-time-for-european-championships","story":"  Glasgow Licensing Board has agreed bars can stay open until 01:00 and clubs until 04:00.

Mr Blackford reiterated fears over Scottish Parliament powers being taken away via Brexit legislation, which has resulted in ongoing parliamentary skirmishes in Westminster between the parties.  At one stage, Speaker John Bercow urged MPs to \"lower the temperature\" due to the ferocity of the heckling and shouting in the chamber.  The SNP\u0027s motion urges the Commons to endorse the principles of the Claim of Right for Scotland and acknowledge the sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine the form of government \"best suited to their needs\".  Leading the debate, Mr Blackford said: \"Is it very fitting today, Mr Speaker, that the Scottish National Party uses our opposition day (debate) on July 4 - independence day (in the United States) - to defend the interests and the rights and the will of the Scottish people?\"  After being heckled by a Scottish Tory MP, Mr Blackford said: \"Listen, it might not be independence day to you but I\u0027ll tell you this - the way the Conservative Party is treating Scotland, our independence day is coming and it\u0027s coming soon.\"  Labour\u0027s Ian Murray (Edinburgh South), intervening, said: \"You say Scotland\u0027s independence is coming... the Scottish people did have a vote in 2014 and they agreed to stay in the United Kingdom.\"  Mr Blackford said there had been a change in circumstances, including Scotland\u0027s desire to stay in the EU while the UK Government wants to ignore them and \"drive us\" out of Europe.  He also railed against the \"biggest power grab\" conducted by Westminster since devolution in 1999, in a nod to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act, which transfers EU law into UK law.  Only about 19 minutes were left for debate on devolution changes linked to the legislation when MPs considered amendments made by the House of Lords last month.  The Scottish Parliament did not grant a legislative consent motion for the key Brexit legislation, prompting claims the Sewel Convention had been ignored.  This is the precedent that Westminster must have the consent of Holyrood to legislate on devolved matters.  The UK Government has previously said the Act delivers \"significant further powers\" to the Scottish Parliament, and it would seek consent unless there are \"not normal circumstances applying\" - describing Brexit as such an exception.  Mr Blackford said \"unknown territory\" had been entered and urged the UK Government to bring forward legislation that protects the Scottish Parliament\u0027s powers.  He added: \"If (Scottish Secretary David Mundell) recognises his role in defending devolution he should do so.  \"A failure to do that should mean, quite frankly, he should resign because he is not standing up for the interests of Scotland.\"  Scottish Secretary David Mundell later said the SNP were guilty of \"power-grab scaremongering, hot air and grandstanding stunts\".  He said: \"All we have now is manufactured grievances, they invent, they misrepresent, they abuse, they try to shout down those who disagree with them, they glory in childish stunts which embarrass the people they purport to represent.\"  Earlier Mr Mundell told MPs the debate told the public \"everything about the SNP and their obsession with independence\".  He said: \"They\u0027re like a broken record, it\u0027s less than two years since Parliament debated a claim of right at the behest of the SNP.  \"Of course in the intervening time we have had an electoral test in Scotland, a General Election, the result as I recall it was the SNP losing 21 seats and 12 Conservative gains.  \"That debate was a charade then, an excuse to talk about independence and it\u0027s a charade today.\""},{"url":null,"title":"business in focus at hotel","story":"\t\tA leading Inverurie hotel has marked the longest day of the year with a special event for local business representatives.\t\t\t\tA Midsummer Networking event was held at Macdonald Pittodrie House Hotel, giving visitors from throughout the region the chance to grow their business contacts and experience the hotel’s facilities and stunning location.

Clients, who suffer from a range of respiratory issues, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and allergies, spend their time relaxing in one of two treatment rooms where the walls and floor are clad in salt. A specialist machine then finely grinds medical grade salt that is released into the air at prescribed concentration levels for the duration of each session.                                                    The therapy, also known as halotherapy, dates back to the ancient Greeks who sought the benefits offered by naturally occurring salt caves for improved health and wellbeing. Providing a 100% natural and drug free complimentary treatment, halotherapy, derived from the Greek alas, meaning \"salt\", is believed to loosen mucus and reduce inflammation making breathing easier.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed.

That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism. It will be \u0026ldquoapplied consistently and fairly across Highland, a council spokeswoman said.Under the plan, the budget and decisions on parking would be devolved to local committees with revenue reinvested locally.Wednesday 4 Jul 2018 11:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116272.jpg","title":"Wick High School pupils light up UK Apps for Good finals with bike success","story":"\u0026nbspThey won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals in London on Wednesday night after wowing the competition judges with their Light Bike \u0026ndash which deploys smart lights to help cyclists safe and visible.The pupils \u0026ndash Nicholas Mann (13), from Ulbster, Caleb James (14), from Kirk, Lewis Buchan (14), Russell Mackenzie (13) and Steven Gunn (16), all Wick \u0026ndash were led by their computing science teacher Chris Aitken.Speaking after the finals at London\u0026rsquos Rich Mix venue, Mr Aitken said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore absolutely delighted to have won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals.

All we are now waiting for is confirmation that it’s fully legal and then we can get on with implementing it. Our lawyers have told us that because we are a commercial operation and currently receive no subsidy whatsoever, we have to be 100 per cent sure that this scheme complies otherwise our whole business is at risk. We are not sure why it is taking so long to get simple confirmation.“Although not one penny of the proposed subsidy comes to us, it goes directly to the passenger, we would be forced to pay it all back if it doesn’t comply, that could ruin us and we can’t take that risk. All we are asking for is for the Scottish Government to check that it’s legal with the EU and UK and then we can get on with it. We have written to the new Minister Michael Matheson MSP and invited him to visit the island and meet our staff so we can share our concerns with him directly and hopefully he will visit soon so we can get this unlocked.“We have also today asked for a meeting with our local MSP Liam McArthur to see if he can do anything to get things moving forward on our behalf. This is extremely frustrating but as a family run, fully commercial Orcadian business, employing 70 people and with exciting expansion plans, we cannot put at risk our business until we are certain the Scottish Government’s proposal fully comply.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That is simply not acceptable.Whatever the outstanding disagreement there may be between the government and commercial operators, Mr McArthur feels that people in Orkney have every right to expect both sides to get this sorted without delay.\u0026#8220The Transport Secretary also needs to confirm that the fare reductions, once agreed, will be backdated to 30 June, in keeping with the firm promises made by his predecessor and the First Minister,\u0026#8221 he said.“This sorry saga has rumbled on for far too long.

Garrie Island, in the River Conon, we have fantastic wet alder woodland, which is designated as being important at both a UK and European level.\"However, the woodland habitat has been under threat

Pam\u0026rsquos paintings are absolutely fantastic and we hope this event is a great success.\"Since the age of 63, Pam\u0026nbsphas painted hundreds of pictures, been a member of art groups and exhibited locally.Until recently she also\u0026nbspknitted clothes for infants in the special baby unit at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and was a puzzle enthusiast, winning the Ross-shire Journal crossword at the age of 99.She celebrated her 100th birthday surrounded by friends and family at the Church of Scotland Hall in the village last year after a neighbour of 36 years\u0026rsquo standing, Joyce Fraser, decided to organise something special to mark the milestone event.Mrs Foster was also joined by friends from the local WRI and art group, along with\u0026nbspstaff and residents of the care home she was about to move to. Mrs Foster\u0026rsquos nieces and nephews from as far afield as the Canary Islands, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Sussex headed north for the event.Her birthday cake, baked by a relative, was shaped as an artist\u0026rsquos palette to represent one of her great passions in life.Mrs Foster was born in Surrey and spent her childhood with her three siblings in Kent, where her father had a grocery business.She started her working life in an office at a department store and then worked as a secretary mainly with legal firms, in England and Edinburgh.Mrs Foster said she and her husband Tony had been \"gradually moving up the country\" before settling in their cottage in Muir of Ord. Her husband passed away in January 2012.Asked the secret of her long life, she said: \"I\u0026rsquove been asked this before and I always say \u0026lsquopure living\u0026rsquo, but of course it\u0026rsquos not!

A number of new schools have been built, which is brilliant for the pupils and communities that benefit.\"Despite receiving more funding than nearly all other local authorities, Highland Council still has the worst school estate in Scotland.\"The funding recognises the rurality of Highland Council, but most schools have been built in more densely populated areas like Inverness.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762978.1530605465!/image/image.jpg","title":"darren mcgarvey i m struggling to cope with success","story":"\t\tAbscesses, insomnia and migraines - Orwell Prize winner Darren McGarvey writes candidly about his mental and emotional struggle with success.\t\t\t\tIt’s 1.38 on Monday morning and, in an abandoned hotel foyer at the Holiday Inn Express in Stratford, I am about to start writing my column. I’m so tired I could cry. \u2028In the morning, we’re taking my son to Thomas The Tank Engine Land and we decided to drive down on Sunday evening to avoid the traffic.             I don’t want to have to work on what should be the first day of a family holiday, which means pulling an all-nighter, so I can file without missing quality time with my children.            This time last week, I was in another hotel in London. The week before that, Edinburgh. Or was it Salford? Or Dundee? It’s hard to say, if I’m honest. The workload has fried my brain to the point I often cannot recall the prior day’s events when asked what I’ve been up to. I feel like I am losing my mind. Every day bleeds into the next, with no respite in sight. But complaining about the fact I feel like I am on the cliff-edge of a mental health crisis seems utterly futile because, from the outside, it appears I am enjoying wonderful, unprecedented success. Success for which I ought to be grateful.Of course, I am grateful. If anything, I am in a state of permanent disbelief about what is going on. The truth is I haven’t had a minute to reflect on or even savour anything that has happened since November last year when the publication of my book began a chain of events that culminated, last Monday, in being awarded the coveted Orwell Prize.More people than ever seem to want to speak to me, for different reasons. Some just want to say, “well done” and others want to share their stories. Some want to me to come and visit their projects and others want to buy the film and TV rights to my life story.             I did some business in London last week that will make your eyes bulge out of their sockets when its announced, yet somehow, in this haze of physical and emotional exasperation, nothing feels real. I don’t even feel real.READ MORE: Scotsman columnist Darren McGarvey wins Orwell Prize for political writingPeople love a good rags-to-riches story. Hell, I know I do. But imagine how surreal it feels when you become the centre of one. You are suddenly inundated with requests, calls, offers and correspondence, without any frame of reference for what is going on. It’s incredibly disorientating and sometimes frightening, if I’m honest. But there is rarely an opportunity to express that truth, because you are always being prompted to describe how it feels to become “successful”. People want to hear a specific story. The story about a diamond in the rough, escaping poverty, surviving neglect and abuse to become an award-winning author. People are less interested in what it took to get into this position.             The fact I am struggling mentally and emotionally is even less interesting. The details about my cluster migraines, abscesses and insomnia are met with looks of confusion, as people instinctively attempt to direct me away from what I want to say and back to the “narrative”: my capitalist hero-journey. They don’t want to hear about the thousands I’ve spent on hotels, trains and flights, travelling this island by myself, with a heavy bag over my shoulder and a box of books under my arm, literally selling hand-to-hand. The hundreds of books I’ve purchased with my own money, to sign and post all over the world to plug gaping holes in my finances. They don’t want to hear about the anxiety attacks I often experience as notifications flood my devices or the fear I suffer every time I give an interview to a newspaper or broadcaster. Nobody cares that I live in constant dread that I will misspeak on a sensitive issue and become a target for people online. Nobody is interested in me describing what it feels like to come home after weeks of being on the road, to find my two-year old sitting with his back to me – his way of letting me know he isn’t pleased with my absence. I haven’t made a penny off my book yet. I am living off advances. But any time I try to express that these overwhelming mundanities – and not the successes – are what currently consume every moment of my waking life, I feel the weight of other people’s expectations bearing down on me. READ MORE: Darren McGarvey: Journalists must leave their ivory towers to gain respect            To the extent that I am learning it’s best to simply conceal the reality of my life, or risk appearing ungrateful or worse, spoiling the vicarious thrill others might experience when they enquire, “how does it feel?”I don’t know how it feels. I haven’t had a minute to take anything in. I run around like a mad-man, I fall asleep somewhere, and I wake up and do it all again. Every. Single. Day. No matter who I speak to, my constant refrain – that I am in urgent need of rest and fear I may be heading for a fall – never seems to be heard. The only thing I haven’t been offered in the last seven days is a good night’s sleep. I feel obligated to so many people, for different reasons, that my own needs fall to the bottom of the hierarchy of concern. My problems are marked as low-priority and so must remain hidden, revealed only in late-night social media outbursts when I feel trapped on Scotland’s decrepit public transportation network.All I need is a few days where I am not expected to do anything. Where I am not obligated to speak to anybody. Where I can gather my thoughts and rejuvenate after two years of non-stop, high-pressure work, couched in constant financial insecurity and stress. Anybody getting any ideas that I’m too far removed from the working class to write about it, ought to refer to my seven-day-a-week schedule for proof that I am more working class now than I ever was – with no holiday entitlement. It’s 3.10am. The kids will be up in four hours.

This is what I have tried to do in my book, Scots and Catalans. Union and Disunion, a comparative  history of two peoples without states of their own, whose attempts to define, reassess and perhaps transform their relationship to the larger polities to which they belong has been drawing headlines across the world.             The book begins with the Middle Ages and ends in December 2017 after the flight to Belgium of the Catalan President, Carles Puigdemont, following the failure of a unilateral bid to break away from the Spanish state and establish Catalonia as an independent republic.Many years ago I wrote a study of the origins of the Catalan rebellion of 1640 against the royal government in Madrid – a rebellion that inspired the creation of a Catalan republic which lasted for a week. As I contemplated the unfolding of today’s Catalan separatist movement and the simultaneous rise of Scottish separatism, I thought it might be illuminating to attempt a sustained comparison of the historical experience of the two countries and of the ways in which a sense of national identity has manifested itself over the centuries.READ MORE: Kenny MacAskill: Stop treating Catalonia as a proxy for ScotlandNaturally there are important differences between the two national histories, but differences can be as revealing as similarities in reaching historical conclusions. One obvious difference is that Scotland was for centuries an independent kingdom, whereas Catalonia was never a truly independent state. It was a principality that formed part of a federation, the Crown of Aragon, which was united with the Crown of Castile as a result of the marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile in 1469. This dynastic union created the country that came to be known as ‘Spain’. Dynastic union between Scotland and England came more than a century later, when James VI of Scotland’s inheritance of the English throne in 1603 created ‘Great Britain’.  The immediate effect of these unions was similar, in the sense that, although both Scotland and Catalonia preserved their traditional forms of government, they were now linked to a far more powerful neighbour. This produced inevitable tensions, and at the start of the 18th century attempts were made to resolve them, although in very different ways. The 1707 Anglo-Scottish Union created a British parliamentary monarchy, in which the Scots surrendered their Edinburgh parliament in exchange for access to England’s expanding commercial and colonial empire.             In 1716, following the surrender of Barcelona two years earlier to the forces of Philip V, who was the monarch of the newly enthroned Bourbon dynasty, Catalonia, like the rest of the Crown of Aragon, was stripped of its traditional laws and liberties, and was merged into what became an authoritarian monarchical Spain.Scotland and Catalonia both benefited economically from the constitutional changes of the early 18th century, although the expansion of Britain’s overseas empire gave the Scots many more opportunities than those enjoyed by the Catalans. The British empire of the 18th and 19th centuries was a joint Anglo-Scottish creation, whereas the Catalans remained on the margins of Spain’s long-established American empire. Instead, they turned their energies to economic development, and became the pioneers of Spanish industrialisation, based on a rapidly growing textile industry. READ MORE: Brian Wilson: Catalonia is evidence of the benefits of a UnionScotland, too, was being transformed by the growth of its industries in the same period, but, unlike Catalonia, it never became the main power-house of the wider, national, economy. The long-term effect of these differences is still to be seen. In Spain, economic and political development were out of kilter in the 19th and early 20th centuries. While Madrid was the country’s political capital, its economic capital was Barcelona. In Britain, London was both.            In the 19th century, Catalonia’s relationship with the government in Madrid soured. This was partly the result of Spain’s chronic political instability in the decades following the Napoleonic invasion and the Peninsular War. But it can also be explained by a pan-European phenomenon, the emergence of a new-style nationalism inspired by the Romantic Movement. The researches of historians, literary scholars and folklorists into the origins of their societies generated a sense of the nation as an organic community with its own distinctive characteristics. Such explorations of the Catalan past helped produce another significant difference between Scotland and Catalonia. It was language that became the point of reference for national identity in Catalonia, in a way that Gaelic would never be for that of Scotland. The Catalans clung to their language when the repressive regime of General Franco sought to replace it with Castilian, the predominant language of Spain. After Franco’s death in 1975, a reaction was inevitable. The autonomous Catalan regime created by the 1978 Constitution of the newly democratic Spain was determined, through its control of the educational system, to ‘Catalanise’ Catalan society in the face of the encroachment of Castilian through the national media. The resulting linguistic question has played a large part in creating the current impasse between Catalonia and the Spanish government.It is one of the ironies of this stand-off that the 30 years between 1978 and the financial collapse of 2008 have been the most prosperous and successful in Catalonia’s colourful history. But the economic crisis gave radical Catalan nationalists a chance to depict Catalonia as the victim of a malign Spanish state, and the inflexibility of a Spanish government determined to treat the secessionist movement as a constitutional question that should properly be left to the courts handed the separatists a propaganda victory that they have exploited to the full. Referendums, whether authorised or unauthorised, as in the Catalan case, are at best blunt instruments for determining the will of the people. In forcing binary choices they can be deeply divisive, and Catalonia is now a bitterly divided society, in which intimidation is being exercised by secessionists who claim to speak for all its inhabitants.

Scots \u0026amp Catalans, by Oxford University history professor John Elliott, is published on 9 July"},{"url":null,"title":"tired old games jamie halcro johnston ","story":"Regrettably, Humza Yousaf has once again chosen to play politics and attack MSPs who have stood up for the interests of Orkney and Shetland at Holyrood while he and his SNP colleagues were trying for months to pretend that their long-standing commitment to fair funding did not exist.\nThere is little doubt that, without this issue being raised up the political agenda, the SNP would have dropped their pledge to the people of the islands like a stone. So it is a shame that Mr Yousaf continues to play the same tired old games, even after the commendable efforts of councillors and MSPs of all parties and none has secured at least some action towards correcting this patently unfair situation.\nThe transport minister is right in congratulating the island councils for their tenacity in pursuing this issue. It\u0026#8217s just a shame it was the actions – or inactions – of his SNP government which forced them to be so tenacious.\nAnd what is now abundantly clear is that, in spite of the SNP\u0026#8217s protests, the money was always available to address this issue. The SNP managed to magic up an extra £170 million yesterday which, apparently, they didn\u0026#8217t have when the budget was first presented. So the question many in the Northern Isles should be asking Mr Yousaf is why didn\u0026#8217t the SNP include fair funding in their draft budget in the first place?\nWhen SNP ministers were trying to dismiss fair funding, I was regularly questioning them in the Scottish Parliament on their commitment. I was meeting with representatives from the island councils – in Lerwick, in Kirkwall and in Edinburgh.\nI put forward the amendment which, accepted by the entire Scottish Parliament (including Mr Yousaf and the SNP), recognised the lifeline nature of our internal ferries. And I wrote to Mr Yousaf and to his boss, Nicola Sturgeon, on the issue.\nSo I suppose it is flattering that, of all the opposition MSPs who voted against the SNP Budget, Mr Yousaf has chosen to single me out in this way for his faux outrage. I would suggest it\u0026#8217s an indication of the effectiveness of my consistent and vocal opposition to the SNP\u0026#8217s attempt to sweep its own fair funding pledge under the carpet.\nAnd in relation to the vote itself, Mr Yousaf seems intent on misleading Shetlanders. The truth is that MSPs do not vote on individual parts of the budget, but rather on the budget as a whole.\nSo, even with the late U-turn on additional ferry funding, this budget remains, overall, a disappointing budget for people and businesses in Shetland. It will mean that many of my constituents – in fact, anyone earning over £26,000 per year – will pay more tax.\nIt will hit the incomes of local people and businesses, something numerous business organisations have warned will harm Scotland\u0026#8217s already sluggish economic growth. And it leaves our local councils across the region still having to make tough spending decisions. So it is for those local and regional MSPs who supported the SNP\u0026#8217s budget to defend their decision. I simply wasn\u0026#8217t prepared to back a budget which will leave too many local people out of pocket.\nAnd an inconvenient fact Mr Yousaf, too busy patting himself on the back for belatedly delivering something even the SNP in Orkney accept was always an SNP commitment, choses to ignore is that this is only a deal for this year and not a long term solution. So the real risk is that we will have to go through this process all over again for next year\u0026#8217s budget.\nI hope next year, the SNP will deliver a long term settlement on fair funding, not another one off. That a long-term solution will be found that will meet the needs of the local communities so reliant on these lifeline links. And that Mr Yousaf, Derek Mackay and the SNP will avoid the political theatrics that have dominated this year\u0026#8217s budget process.\n Edinburgh.\n If all politicians behaved in this manner it is likely that every budget in every parliament would fail, even though every single clause had enthusiastic and popular local backing no one was willing to support the package as a whole.\n Clearly these are not the section of his constituents Mr Halcro \u0026#8211 Johnston is interested in.\n The tartan Tories are living up to their name for sure and their blind supporters still try to defend them.\nMr Halcrow objects to political parties playing games?\n\nWhich party does Christopher \u0026#8216up-skirting\u0026#8217 Chope belong to again?\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"6 herrisdale park tingwal ","story":"Offers over £145,000\n nursery.\nIn addition to the two double bedrooms, the accommodation includes a single bedroom, dining kitchen, livingroom, shower room and separate toilet.
