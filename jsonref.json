Riot police armed with foam bullet guns fired on protesters as the violence spread across the city centre          Protesters responded by firing flares and smoke bombs towards the police outside their headquarters building Reuters TV footage showed police armed with batons forcing their way through the crowd while demonstrators threw stones and flares. News channel 24h showed police grappling one-on-one with demonstrators, who fell back before reforming their lines.Some projectiles were fired, with a Reuters photographer among those hospitalised after being hit in the stomach by a rubber or foam bullet. Catalan emergency services said that, in all, six people were hospitalised.The organisers of the earlier protest, grassroots groups Assemblea Nacional Catalana (ANC) and Omnium Cultural, had hoped that, with pro-secessionist parties split over what strategy to adopt, it would refocus attention in the secessionist camp by drawing the largest crowd since the court verdicts were passed.\u0027From the street we will keep defending all the (people\u0027s) rights but from the institutions we need political answers,\u0027 ANC leader Elisenda Paluzie told the gathering, pledging to organise more protests.Local police said around 350,000 attended, compared with a daily peak of some 500,000 at the October 18 protest and 600,000 at a march that took place on Catalonia\u0027s national day last month.All those figures, however, represent only a small percentage of the region\u0027s 7.5 million population and its electorate is almost evenly split over the issue of independence.Mainstream Spanish parties, including the minority Socialist government, have consistently rejected moves towards Catalan independence and all bar left-wing Podemos are opposed to any form of referendum.

One said: ‘He listens to all sides, chipping in, “Great idea, what about that”, and then waits to see if anyone comes back to counter it. If they do, he goes, “Oh gosh, yes, good point.” Then he usually sides with whatever Dom said.’The aide added: ‘It’s not civil war. But these people are assertive characters, which is as it should be. There are obviously different views on how to get out of this. This is real roll-of-the-dice stuff. We are one bad move away from Corbyn having the nuclear codes so obviously these things have to be stress-tested’.Mr Cummings, along with other veterans of the 2016 Vote Leave campaign, has argued that a quick ‘people versus Parliament’ Election during the imminent delay to Brexit would create the perfect conditions for a healthy Tory majority.But the One Nation group – led by Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith and longstanding adviser Sir Eddie Lister – would rather delay an Election and let the deal go through the Commons even if it is ‘wrecked’ by pro-Remain amendments such as forcing the UK to stay in a customs union. They argue that as no Parliament can bind its successor, a future Tory Government could use its majority from the next Election to unpick any wrecking amendments.A leading One Nation adviser claims the Suicide Squad has forced Mr Johnson to go against his ‘gut instinct’ to delay the Election until at least March – although Labour’s expected refusal to vote on tomorrow’s motion to trigger a poll means he is struggling to even control that decision.Some colleagues say that making high-stakes decisions, under the long shadow of Theresa May’s 2017 Election fiasco, has left the normally ebullient Prime Minister seeming ‘distracted and subdued’. But aides who worked with Mr Johnson at City Hall counter: ‘As long as he is still laughing, he is OK. When the laughter stops, that is when you need to worry.         For the current Prime Minister, it is his 6am walks with Dilyn the dog and running sessions on a treadmill left behind by Theresa May which give him the clarity of thought to try to deal with his multiple political dilemmas‘There is still laughter from Boris, but not as much as there was. He knows the enormity of the task he is facing.’Another aide said: ‘Tigger has definitely lost his bounce... he is totally shattered after not having a proper day off since May.’ But Mr Johnson insists to friends he’s ‘full of beans’ and keen to get on the campaign trail to ‘stick it to Jeremy Corbyn’. Yesterday he was said to be in ‘particularly high spirits’ as he watched England defeat the All Blacks in the Rugby World Cup semi-final.Mr Johnson has been warned by the One Nation moderates of the risk that if he holds a winter Election, Labour could take advantage of the expected flu crisis – the virus is sweeping Australia and heading for the UK – to savage the Government’s stewardship of the NHS. Pictures of homeless people ‘freezing on the streets’ could also be used to portray the party as ‘callous’.Mr Johnson is understood to be particularly troubled by a lack of private data pointing to a likely Tory win in a December Election.A One Nation source said: ‘There is not one piece of evidence to say where these extra seats will come from if we have a Christmas Election. Not one.‘This is entirely the wrong strategy. Boris has been captured by Cummings. What we want is Boris the Statesman. He should be calmly but resolutely getting the deal through Parliament. This is the battle for Boris’s political soul – just as he wrote two newspaper articles, one backing Remain and one backing Leave, and only made his mind up at the last minute. That’s how he is.’However, members of the Suicide Squad insist the Withdrawal Bill has to be ‘parked’ now to stop Remainers from wrecking it. One said: ‘Parliament will try to f*** up the Withdrawal Bill by amending it to include a customs union or second referendum. There may even be a move to dust off Theresa May’s deal and put that in.’         On Friday, Dominic Cummings told a meeting that the current crop of MPs was ‘the worst parliament in 400 years’ and insisted that the Government should not ‘be sucked into the morass of this zombie parliament’The source suggested those attempts would have to come before the end of the week while John Bercow, who is due to quit as Speaker, was still in the Chair.On Friday, Cummings told a meeting that the current crop of MPs was ‘the worst parliament in 400 years’ and insisted that the Government should not ‘be sucked into the morass of this zombie parliament’.Despite Mr Johnson being in ‘constant text contact’ with Emmanuel Macron, hopes were last night fading that the French President would be able to force through just a short Brexit extension to the end of November.No 10 hoped this would focus the minds of MPs back to a straight ‘Deal versus No Deal’ choice to scare them into passing the motion. ‘Even if we get a month, the Remainers will just make us extend again,’ said a Suicide Squad member. That is why we need an Election ASAP.’Mr Johnson’s equanimity has also been tested by the fate of the 21 rebel Tory MPs who lost the whip after voting to block a No Deal Brexit. Up to 50 Tory MPs have made clear they will not vote for an Election until assurances have been given the 21 will be allowed back into the party.There is also anger at Labour’s game-playing – which Mr Johnson lays at the door of Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer, who No 10 believes is putting his own leadership ambitions before anything else.One joke in Whitehall runs: ‘Why is Jeremy called LINO? He is leader in name only – and people walk all over him.’A friend of the Prime Minister said: ‘He is frustrated by Labour’s lack of direction and inability to make a decision. Boris is appalled by just how weak Corbyn is. He clearly wants the Election but is being held hostage by his own party, mainly Keir. Labour’s got to come clean. Are they saying there must be no No Deal by January 31 or no No Deal ever? If it’s the latter, it basically means they are in favour of revoking Article 50.’But the PM is at pains not to display his concerns. Addressing Tory peers in Parliament’s Moses Room last Wednesday, he compared himself to the biblical hero, concluding with a cry to ‘Let my people go!’Throughout the drama, his girlfriend Carrie Symonds is said to have given ‘rock-solid support’. A source said: ‘Every evening he makes a point of going through everything in his day with her and she keeps him feeling upbeat.’Mr Johnson has also stuck to his ‘do or dry’ pledge to give up booze until the UK is out of the EU, although some friends think he might benefit from ‘a glass or two’ to wind down.Time to bring out the Pol Roger? "},{"url":null,"title":"X Men actor James McAvoy secretly marries girlfriend Lisa Liberati","story":"Share this article               Glasgow-born James first met Lisa when he filmed the movie Split in Philadelphia two years ago (together left).

At least, the glistening modernity we seek in all aspects of our lives costs too much. There is widespread agreement that Britons deserve the best healthcare modern methods, equipment and trained staff can provide.There are transport networks desperately in need of funding for upgrades and much-needed maintenance, and for new railway lines to take polluting and carbon-generating cars off the road. The costs run into billions of pounds.Talking of cars, we want subsidy schemes to swap the UK’s current complement of 39 million petrol and diesel vehicles (cars, lorries and buses) to something more environmentally friendly. When no more than 250,000 currently comply with the definition of environmentally friendly, that’s a tall order.Sticking to the environmental theme, millions of homes need to be insulated and there need to be more of them, preferably offering subsidised rents, to accommodate millennials currently living with their parents and the extra 220,000 legal migrants who arrive each year and want somewhere to live.There are campaigns to keep TV licences free for the 3.7 million aged over 75 while the BBC, which is currently suffering huge cuts to the finance needed to cover most of that £750m cost, should remain well funded to maintain its role as a cornerstone of British values.The eclectic and long wish list goes on and on, ning calls for a sophisticated border force ready to keep out illegal immigrants and a national superfast broadband network to making sure that the Royal Navy, which has admitted that a quarter of its 76 ships are unseaworthy, has enough money to refit them.These bills add up to hundreds of billions of pounds over the next 20 years, a period when the population will age and Brexit will chase away many of those companies that have stationed themselves in the UK exactly to benefit from access to the EU.This is all before we have reviewed the broader welfare system and decided how much more money it needs to provide a decent living for disabled people, the elderly and those unable to find work. Such is the shortfall between what we want and what we can afford that something needs to give. We can tax more or borrow more or work harder and produce more stuff to sell.Had the chancellor gone ahead with his planned budget on 6 November, we might have heard a little of his thinking on the subject.Javid said last month he would spend around £13.8bn extra a year, restoring the police and schools budgets to something near to their previous peaks. He has pledged to increase spending on infrastructure and has backed higher spending on health, increasing the NHS budget by £20bn over a decade.But he knows this just scratches the surface of what is needed to make up for nine years of austerity and to keep pace with developments in the digital age.The Tory plan is to limit public spending on infrastructure to the bare minimum, leaving the bulk of the upgrade to the private sector.In the 21st century, that means leaving the building of nuclear power stations to the French, digital infrastructure to the Americans and Chinese, and steel manufacture to the Turkish military pension fund currently in the throes of buying British Steel.These foreign owners want two concessions: firstly to pay zero corporate taxes and, when they provide domestic services, charge a whopping rent.All of this might be affordable if we weren’t paying such high rents to the owners of Britain’s land and property.The US, France and Germany have their property hotspots, yet most of the land remains cheap and rents in large cities can be still be affordable.In the UK, we are all shelling out huge sums on rent and mortgages that could be used to pay tax on collective goods and services, or to buy those goods and services directly.In 2017, the total amount of rent paid by tenants in Britain soared to more than £50bn, more than double the level seen a decade ago. The total level of mortgage payments has changed little in that time, as the old pay off their loans and own homes outright, while the young take on bigger loans over longer periods to pay ever higher property prices.It’s easy to see why the left dodges the issue of rent when so many voters are either landlords themselves, invest in property or think property will one day be their financial saviour.In his book Who Owns England, Guy Shrubsole lays out the problem with startling clarity. He shows that excessive rents are the virus eating away at Britain’s economic future. It should be tackled now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18e8606fb48181f319e4082c825ab7053afc2115/0_0_3894_2336/master/3894.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6961c7cdda321fa2e86888eba535176a","title":"tell us south african cities after apartheid","story":"We would like to speak to people about their views and experiences of city life in the country since the demise of the brutal political regimeThis year marks 25 years since the end of apartheid in South Africa, a brutal political system that enforced the segregation of people of different races.From 1948 to 1994 the ision was formalised by law, ensuring the minority white population controlled wealth and power, while black people were oppressed and stripped of basic rights, such as the right to vote.Twenty-five years after the fall of the brutal apartheid regime, South Africa\u0027s cities remain hugely ided, both economically and racially.

Facebook, which that day had sent us a letter threatening legal action if we published, had issued a press release saying it had kicked Cambridge Analytica off its platform.It was a last-gasp attempt to get ahead of a story that Facebook knew was set to break. But it was too late. We worked through the night, brought forward our publishing time, and then the story was out there.If this seems like ancient history, it isn’t. Because last week Mark Zuckerberg appeared before the US Congress’s House financial services committee to talk about Facebook’s plans for its Libra cryptocurrency and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the congresswoman for New York’s 14th district, got five minutes to grill him.“Mr Zuckerberg, I think you of all people can appreciate using a person’s past behaviour in order to determine, make decisions or predict people’s future behaviour, and in order for us to make decisions about Libra I think we need to kind of dig into your past behaviour and Facebook’s past behaviour with respect to our democracy. Mr Zuckerberg, what year and month did you personally become aware of Cambridge Analytica?”Watching it on a small screen on my phone, I was on the edge of my seat. This was the question that I and a small group of super-nerds, which includes MPs such as Damian Collins and Ian Lucas, have been banging on about for more than a year. Because Zuckerberg last testified to Congress in April 2018 but so many more facts have come to light since. Facts that cast serious doubts over that testimony. Doubts that have opened up a serious question: did he lie on oath to Congress?This is what Ocasio-Cortez was trying to dig into. “I’m not sure of the exact time,” said Zuckerberg. “But it was probably around the time when it became public, I think it was around March of 2018, I could be wrong.”The problem for Zuckerberg is not that this defies common sense, though it does. It’s that it opens up a whole new world of trouble for Facebook. To understand why, you need to go back to the four days that followed Facebook’s legal threat to us and then its middle-of-the-night press release. Four days in which Facebook’s stock market value plummeted more than $100bn and the company went into lockdown. When Zuckerberg finally emerged, a story was in place. The problem for him is that this has steadily been unravelling ever since.In July this year, a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation revealed that employees knew that Cambridge Analytica, described as a “sketchy” business, had been “scraping” Facebook data in 2015, before even the ’s first report.What about Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg? Ocasio-Cortez asked. When did she know? What about board member Peter Thiel? Zuckerberg drew a blank. His memory banks had nothing.“This was the largest data scandal with respect to your company that had catastrophic impacts with regard to 2016… and you don’t know?” asked Ocasio-Cortez.“Congresswoman, we discussed it when we were aware of what happened.”The evidence continues to mount. And the answers Zuckerberg gave Ocasio-Cortez only invite further questions. The fact is that the Cambridge Analytica data scandal is far from over. In some ways, it’s only just beginning. It’s not the crime, as the saying goes, it’s the cover-up. And that continues.Because we know Facebook lied. The SEC investigation says that. To us at the Observer, in fact “… when asked by reporters in 2017 about its investigation into the Cambridge Analytica matter, Facebook falsely claimed the company found no evidence of wrongdoing”.On 7 November, I will give evidence to the international grand committee of parliamentarians from nine countries who have banded together to try to get answers from Facebook. But Zuckerberg has again refused to give evidence to the representatives of countries numbering more than half a billion people.We have to recognise that Facebook is a foreign company that operates beyond the reach of our laws and should be nowhere near our elections.I was in Tirana at a conference of data privacy commissioners from around the world when Ocasio-Cortez was grilling Zuckerberg. John Edwards, the commissioner for New Zealand, which since the Christchurch massacre has been taking the fight to the tech giants, likened it to “bringing a pocket knife not to a gunfight but to a nuclear explosion”.We know our elections are unsafe. And until Facebook can prove it has fixed that, microtargeted political advertising based on unknown data from unknown sources should simply be banned.We are at an extraordinary crossroads. We have sufficient information to know that Facebook’s platform was used to subvert and undermine elections in the US, the UK and many other countries. But we pretend to be helpless to prevent it happening again. We’re not. We’re simply hamstrung by a government and an opposition that have chosen to ignore it. Ocasio-Cortez’s bold questions don’t just show Zuckerberg up but Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn also.Our elections are not safe. And this month Facebook took the decision to make them even more unsafe. Just over a week after Zuckerberg held a closed-door meeting with Donald Trump, we discovered he’d changed Facebook’s policy to allow posts by politicians or parties containing “deceptive, false or misleading content”. It’s an extraordinary decision championed by Zuckerberg in a speech in which he said: “I believe we must continue to stand for free expression.”Facebook’s global head of policy, Nick Clegg, who once railed against the “blatant lies” told in the European referendum, has now sanctioned their use in all political adverts in all elections in all countries across the world.We’re not helpless. Ocasio-Cortez shows us that. We are just being betrayed by our government and our opposition. “Why is this lying bastard lying to me?” is a traditional approach to journalism. We in Britain should be asking: why are these lying politicians not taking action over this lying company that is allowing lying politicians to lie to me?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f63d0f954a5c74a345fe38f5c095a734385e788/1683_0_8593_5156/master/8593.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=040dac4244ac99760d844acaa0440df5","title":"halloween ancient graves give up secrets michael rosen british museum folkton drums","story":"Michael Rosen will give a poet’s take on prehistoric burial items, including the Folkton drums, at the British MuseumThree are chalk cylinders, buried with a six-year-old child. Four are shiny gold discs and one is an ancient bronze mirror. For thousands of years, they lay in the cold dark earth, their names forgotten, their meaning lost, waiting to be found.Now, for the first time, they are being held up to the light, with three new poems by Michael Rosen that celebrate the spectacular prehistoric objects buried in Britain’s early graves.The poems, which Rosen will read aloud on Halloween at the British Museum, were commissioned by the museum and the universities of Reading and Manchester as part of a project to understand the significance of ancient British burial objects and why their owners would have wanted them in their graves.Researchers asked Rosen to write about three specially selected items: the Folkton drums, buried with a small child in North Yorkshire around 5,000 years ago the Knowes of Trotty discs that were buried with a woman on Orkney in 2,000 BC and the intricately decorated Portesham mirror, buried with an old woman in Dorset around AD 40-50.Archaeologists speculate that the drums may have been part of a measuring device – and perhaps charted a child’s growth. The discs were probably worn on a special garment as ornaments. The mirror was probably made specially for its owner.Experts said the graves of both women indicated that they played powerful roles in their communities, contradicting traditional stereotypes about prehistoric culture.For Rosen, this is a chance to unlock the meaning that was attributed to these objects when their owners touched them for the last time. “There is no such thing as a human being who is not intertwined with the objects of their lives,” he says. “We express ourselves in the objects that we make, acquire, buy or inherit. It’s not possible to conceive of the idea of consciousness separate from the objects through which we express ourselves.”He believes poetry can help to interpret the emotions contained and conveyed in ancient burial objects that have lost their symbolic power. “You can place an object in a museum and ask people to stare at it. But for many of us, like myself, we need some kind of mediation, some way of understanding the object that is more than we can get off the surface of it.”The moment people begin to speculate about the purpose of an object, he says, they enter the realm of imagination and interpretation. “Poetry combines feelings with ideas in quite an intuitive sort of a way. It is one of the ways people’s curiosity can be aroused.”Rosen hopes his poetry will enable people to understand the connections that existed between the objects and their makers. “I am fascinated by what these objects say about people and what people were saying about the objects.”It is a conversation that he thinks was always meant to be had beyond the grave. “Someone has crafted these objects with all sorts of intentions and these aren’t closed. They are not the end of a conversation. People are using these objects for purposes beyond themselves.“And by making them durable, they must have had some sense that these objects could last, and therefore that different people would find them and look at them, whether that was in the afterworld – or another place.” Neil Wilkin, curator of early Europe at the British Museum, believes the poems will be a useful resource for teachers, now that the government has added Britain’s ancient history to the national curriculum.“Teachers have been given this task of teaching about prehistory,” he says. “That’s really quite unfair, because teachers don’t have a lot of background knowledge about this period.”It is particularly challenging because there are so few texts from the period that people can engage with, he says. “We don’t have written text. We can’t rely on Roman historians telling us what people believed or who they were. It’s a time that’s quite shadowy and difficult. So, by asking a poet to use his power of language, we’re almost helping to fill that gulf.”He hopes the poems will show the human, emotional side of the people living in prehistoric Britain, and engender a connection with other humans across time and space. “Burial allows iniduals in the past to be known,” he says.The Folkton drums – three carved chalk cylinders that were placed in a child’s grave, close to the body, in a seemingly protective way – made Rosen think about his son Eddie, who died of meningitis aged 18. “I remembered what we cremated with him: a football scarf and a bottle of his favourite beer.“It was quite important for people in the family to put memories with him, into the coffin. I was able to make those analogies when I was thinking about that child.” He adds: “You can’t stop yourself having those emotions, looking at these objects.”The drums, in particular, he found astonishing. “I’d never seen anything like them before. The idea of putting that with a child in a grave – it made me feel I was in another land, that this was beyond my ken.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6526f2a98aefa2c4511acb73ef914b90acff9bb5/0_0_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7605f6ed690cc27e65e27cb0919ad2f","title":"school admission england application forms","story":"Leaving blank spaces on application forms leads to risk of being assigned least popular school in area, experts sayParents should avoid leaving blanks on their children’s school application forms since they risk being assigned to the least popular school in the area, according to experts.Calling for an overhaul to simplify the system, the Good Schools Guide said parents were forced to conduct labour-intensive research and fill in reams of paperwork during a process that “no doubt favours certain sections of society”.It notes that there is significant variation in school admission policies, with inidual schools demanding different information and using different criteria for admitting pupils. The Local Government Association (LGA) has called for a review to make the system more inclusive.Elizabeth Coatman, state education specialist at the Good Schools Guide, said parents should provide the total number of choices including any school they are in the catchment area for – even if it is as their final choice – to avoid local authorities inevitably filling in blank spaces with the least popular schools.Schools with good results and reputations are most likely to be oversubscribed, the Good Schools Guide said, but can also have complicated policies setting out how they will decide which pupils will be given places – known as oversubscription criteria.“The variation in admissions policies is incredible,” Coatman said. “What one school demands of an applicant may be very different from the requirements of an apparently similar school down the road.“I have every sympathy for parents who find getting to grips with the complexity of some state school admissions policies gives them a headache. We have seen one that runs to 12 pages.“Setting aside time to research options and work out the likelihood of a successful application, not to mention fathoming the further obligations and paperwork as required by some schools, is labour-intensive and no doubt favours certain sections of society.” A spokeswoman from the LGA said: “We want to be sure that schools admissions policies are inclusive for all local children. This is why the LGA believes the government should hold a review to make the system simpler and more inclusive, so all children can get the best education possible.”A Department for Education spokeswoman said concerns over admission arrangement at state schools should be raised with the schools adjudicator. “We are committed to offering parents and children a erse education system. All state-funded schools are required to publish their full admissions arrangements on their website, displaying them for the whole academic year.

Latin American correspondent Tom Philips took a 2,000km journey through the Amazon to see the new age of wrecking ushered in by Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, where the environmental agency is being dismantled and gold seekers and soy farmers anticipate an economic boom from deforestation.There are also those attempting to make it better. On 1 September 2018 we published an interview from Stockholm with a 15-year-old who just two weeks earlier, after Sweden’s hottest ever summer, had gone on strike from school in protest at the lack of action by politicians on the climate crisis. Now much better known, thanks in part to articles like this, Greta Thunberg’s solo protest has since become a global movement.Climate can also lie at the root of other stories. Failed harvests and rising food prices can often be the final straw that triggers political upheaval, in recent years notably the Arab spring, but we are now seeing in real time how the climate emergency is affecting migration patterns. As Donald Trump attempted to close the US border to Central American migrants, in some cases separating children from their parents, we spoke to those in Guatemala who after a decade of intense droughts and late rains have seen crops fail and wages fall one too many times. “I have to find a way to travel north, or else my children will suffer even more,” subsistence farmer Esteban Gutiérrez told reporter Nina Lakhani.Business and economics are right at the centre of the climate emergency. Companies are among the biggest polluters in the world – and are key to meeting the Paris agreement’s target of limiting global warming to 1.5C.From giant fossil fuel companies to agricultural and food businesses, retailers, airlines and car manufacturers – all must make big changes, for the sake of the planet, the global economy and their own future sustainability, providing goods and services and employment.These are huge questions, and  readers know there are no easy answers. So we will nurture the debate on what a sustainable economy looks like.Our economics writers are questioning whether traditional capitalism, which aims for perpetual growth, can ever deal with the huge challenges of climate emergency, or whether a new slow-capitalism or green growth – which does not pursue profit at all costs – must come.We are reporting on the changes being made by corporate executives – and alerting readers to those who fall short.Writing in the  earlier this year, the governors of the Bank of England and Bank of France – Mark Carney and François Villeroy de Galhau – underlined the importance of change. “If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,” they said.Without action, the climate emergency poses the risk of huge losses for insurance companies as a result of catastrophic weather-related events. Last year’s Californian wildfires, for instance – the worst in the state’s history – cost insurers more than $12bn. Banks that have lent vast sums to fossil fuel companies could be left with mammoth losses if those investments decline in value and become “stranded assets”. The Bank of England has warned that as much as $20tn of assets could be wiped out by climate change if the problem is not addressed.Many companies are making changes. Global businesses including Nestle and L’Oreal have committed to reducing their carbon emissions to zero. We will track and report on their progress.We are reporting on climate crisis initiatives, and our journalists will ask if they go far enough. Last week we reported that British Airways is to offset all emissions from domestic flights from next year, and questioned whether offsetting can ever be the answer.Our reporters will expose companies that are not walking the talk. Last month Amazon announced a series of initiatives, from putting 100,000 electric vans on the road to handle its deliveries to reforestation projects. But, as our reporters also revealed recently, Amazon has also recently introduced plastic packaging that cannot be recycled in the UK.Most corporate bosses know they have to make changes. But progress is nowhere near fast enough. Oil companies are still seeking new oilfields. Giant new coalmines – like Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s Carmichael coalmine in Queensland – are still being developed. Airbus recently predicted that the number of aircraft in the sky would double in the next 20 years.Investment groups that manage pension funds around the world can exert pressure on companies to clean up their businesses. Legal \u0026amp General, Europe’s second biggest fund manager, admitted earlier this year: “The effects of climate change will soon be irreversible. This will affect economies, politics and, as a result, our clients’ assets all around the world. We all need to move faster.”However, not every investment group is using its muscle – and we are calling them out. BlackRock, the world’s biggest investment manager, with $6tn under its management, says climate change is a big risk to the value of its investments. But it remains at the heart of fossil fuel investing and, as we reported, its chief executive, Larry Fink, still insists that BlackRock’s job is to make a profit for investors. He added: “Our personal views on environmental or social issues don’t matter.”They do matter, and our reporters are now treating the climate crisis as the default setting for how they approach business reporting.Fashion is about the zeitgeist, and climate change is the mostimportant issue of our age. And we know that our readers really *do* care. (Sorry, Melania.) So more than ever before, we want to put sustainability front and centre of our fashion coverage.We aren’t perfect and we don’t pretend to have all the answers. Wewill continue to listen to a wide range of voices – our readersparamount amongst those – to guide us. But we do know that we want to talk about sustainability how we have always talked about fashion – in a way that includes everyone in the conversation, whatever their age, budget, gender or background.We have always championed ethical fashion brands, but now we want to go further. The future of our planet isn’t a niche interest. We aim to continue creating fashion content that is accessible and appealing, desirable and democratic – but now with sustainability as a fundamental metric. We want to inspire our audience to enjoy fashion while being mindful of the impact on the planet.What does that look like? We try wherever we can to include vintagepieces in shoots and gift guides. When we report from London fashion week we talk to the Extinction Rebellion activists outside the shows, as well as having backstage chats with the designers. We championed Secondhand September and a year ago we updated my column in Weekend magazine so that you now see me wearing old clothes from my own wardrobe, and vintage pieces, alongside new clothes. This party season we will be reporting the best places to rent your dress, or source it pre-worn, rather than buy it.None of this means compromising on bringing you compelling, gorgeous, original fashion content. We are passionate about the latest fashion – and about the future of our planet, too.There’s an obvious connection between food and the climate emergency. Look at the deforestation of the Amazon to provide grazing for cattle and soy to feed it. But wherever cows are raised, they generate atmosphere-heating methane. As the global human population grows, it’s clear that we need to think about how to feed it, how to use land and what impact our choices have.Meat eating and animal farming have seized the headlines and the public’s focus. There are many reasons why veganism – or at least flexitarianism – is growing fast and sustainability is one of them.It’s important to talk about all this but what people eat is always going to be a highly personal decision. In many countries where we have the luxury of food options, we are in anxious, uncertain, ided times. Food is joyful. It brings people together – families, friends, communities and strangers – and reminds us both of our uniqueness and of what we have in common. It’s also a time when it’s difficult to know who to believe and to trust.

Following discussions among editors about how we could change the language we use in our coverage of environmental issues, our attention then turned to images. We have been working across the organisation to better understand how we aim to visually communicate the impact the climate emergency is having across the world.Our goal is to provide guidelines for anyone working with images at the . We are also asking the agencies and photographers we work with to provide images that are appropriate to the changing narrative.The concern over how best to depict the climate emergency led us to seek advice from the research organisation Climate Visuals, who have found that “images that define climate change shape the way it is understood and acted upon”.It was important to address our own use of images and understand the processes that lead to image selection for our environmental and weather stories. When given a story, a picture editor or subeditor may have a short time to choose an image from our database, which is why the availability and prominence of climate crisis photography is a key element in the process. It can also be difficult for photographers to capture images that reflect global heating, weather patterns and wildlife extinction, especially when trying to depict what cannot always be seen.We know, from years of experience, that people love polar bears and pandas, so it is easy to see how these appealing creatures have become the emblems for the topics of endangered species and what we previously termed as global warming. Often, when signalling environmental stories to our readers, selecting an image of a polar bear on melting ice has been the obvious – though not necessarily appropriate – choice. These images tell a certain story about the climate crisis but can seem remote and abstract – a problem that is not a human one, nor one that is particularly urgent.So it made sense when we heard that research conducted by the team at Climate Visuals has shown that people respond to human pictures and stories. Images that show emotion and pictures of real situations make the story relevant to the inidual. Rather than choosing, say, an image of a smoke stack pumping out pollution or a forest on fire, such as this: … we should consider showing the direct impact of environmental issues on people’s daily lives as well as trying to indicate the scale of the impact, such as these:In the UK, the weather is a national preoccupation and as such a subject of tradition for British newspapers. People enjoying a sunny holiday weekend, or a fresh fall of snow at home or abroad can deliver some delightful and beautiful images:But as we have reported, the science tells us a much more sinister story of regular heatwaves and unseasonal weather being a defining indicator of the climate crisis. So, although scenes of children playing in fountains and everyone racing to the beach can be uplifting and irresistible, we have to be mindful of the tone of our journalism. This summer, the British media published dramatic headlines issuing climate warnings and covered in detail the negative impact of the crisis, but the images were typically of people taking pleasure in the environment. The contradiction in messaging, between the headlines and imagery, can undermine the effect of the reporting and how we perceive the risks.In June this year we published a picture gallery on the heatwave across Europe. In its original form, this was of a lighter tone, but we felt on reflection this was wrong and disregarded the current context, so we amended the publication to include images that covered a range of human experience of the extraordinary temperatures.The photographer Brook Mitchell made an impactful series about the drought in Australia affecting families in New South Wales, which we published as a photo essay in July. The environmental scenes of the scorched landscape were striking, as were the suffering animals, but the portraits and stories of the people battling the catastrophe really anchored the piece and drove the level of engagement.It is an example of how, as picture editors and photographers, we are having to think again about finding the right focus. Many of the impacts to communities, bioersity, agriculture, water and food supply represent the escalating crisis our planet faces, yet visually they can be far more challenging to depict. We need new imagery for new narratives. This can be challenging in a fast-paced newsroom but it is important to be nuanced and creative with search terms to unearth photography beyond the usual keywords of climate change, heatwave and floods.As our stories make a journey from their initial point of publication through the various networks of social media we also have to be mindful of how the image is connected to the headline. We have to consider that the two must work together to allow the reader to make a broad sense of the article often simply at a glance. Relatable images that are not overly abstract have become a good choice.However, in its simplest form, getting the emotional tone of imagery in line with the issue is critical, rather than the visual overload of society universally having fun in the sun. We hope that if we keep having these conversations, we will be able to have even more of an impact with our climate coverage, and others will follow suit.If you are a journalist, a photographer or work with other news organisations depicting the climate crisis, please contact membershipeditorial@ to join our conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aa18d2a32dce609d4eb036565424fe22b3b0a8f/0_78_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75e821f5ce30ae6fcdc4646cb012cff8","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 air travel advice","story":" travel editor Andy Pietrasik explains how a flexitarian approach can enable us to enjoy exploring the planet without increasing our carbon footprintWe recently published a guide to Helsinki in which we gave details of how to get there and back without flying. In the comments below the article, a reader wrote: “I think you have to concede that it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that people will be going to Helsinki by train and boat … very few will be willing to allocate six days of the holiday just for the journey. It’s simply not a practical suggestion.”The rise of low-cost flights over the past 20 or so years means we have become so accustomed to flying everywhere for our holidays and short breaks that the idea of taking so long over a journey has become unthinkable. We expect to maximise our time in a location and minimise our time in transit. But maybe that has to change.Another reader put this into context: “In the 70s it was customary to travel around Europe by train (or bus, or hitchhiking). I’ve travelled between Finland and the UK many times by train, and it is quite a pleasant experience.”Travel can have a magical transformation on iniduals and communities. We hope through our pages to encourage people to explore the world, to discover, first-hand, locations they may only have read about in history books or novels to open themselves up to new experiences and tastes to meet people with different ideas and perspectives to try out alternative lifestyles to immerse themselves in beautiful landscapes to have fun. Our writers tap into the joy of new experiences, whether it’s the exhilaration of swimming through a city, as our writer did in Basel, or the thrill of tackling Ireland’s Big Five adventures. And we know that our readers are adventurous and well-travelled because every week we feature their tips from around the world. But we also recognise the need to help tackle the climate emergency by reducing the number of flights we all take. Environment journalist John Vidal explored the dilemma that “people like me, cursed with loving travel” now face, when he reported on the Swedish concept of “flygskam”, or fly shame. And he referred to people applying the idea of the “flexitarian” diet – where they cut back on their meat consumption dramatically but not completely – to flying.The majority of locations we feature in the ’s weekly travel section do not rely on flying to get there, with most easily accessible by train and public transport. These range from Greek island-hopping odysseys to cycling holidays through Europe and city breaks served by train or ferries.Our Local’s Guide series is one of the most popular and widely read features because each one is written by a local resident in the spirit of showing a visitor around their favourite affordable haunts, rather than the big-ticket attractions. Food and drink is probably the easiest way into another culture, and there can be no better recommendation for somewhere to eat and drink than from someone who lives there. We’ve been tapping in to local people’s tips since Twitter started more than 10 years ago, and have found bloggers all around Europe to compile lists of their favourite cheap places to eat and drink.On our website, we have a long list of guides to alternative cities – Łódź, Genoa and Utrecht, Berne, Burgos and Bristol, for example – rather than perennial hotspots affected by overtourism, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice.One of the benefits of flying less, of course, is the opportunity it affords to explore the rich and varied landscapes of our own islands. Over the summer, we ran a popular series of stories called car-free coast, in which the writer Phoebe Taplin explored the British seaside on foot and by bus. An avowed public transport enthusiast and non-flyer, Dixe Wills, shared 20 of his favourite campsites accessible by train and bus. And Kevin Rushby set out on a UK expedition to less-visited locations that would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive to get to by car.We still occasionally run stories on long-haul destinations when there is an important initiative or project that benefits the environment or local community, such as the development of community-led tourism startups in Chilean Patagonia following the launch of new national parks in the world’s most ambitious rewilding project.Tourism accounts for one in 10 of the world’s jobs and is vital to some destinations. Kevin Rushby, our principal travel writer, explains: “All around the world, people in disadvantaged communities have been working to set up projects that rely on tourism, and so flying. I’ve met hunters who’ve become wildlife guides, fishermen who are now ing instructors, farmers who get cash for showing visitors their land and life. In Kenya the great migration route has been saved by Maasai herders clubbing their land together as conservancies rather than selling to hoteliers and intensive farming interests. Those conservancies are reliant on overseas visitors who pay to see wildlife.”The Travel website now also features a carbon calculator, and we have written about various carbon offsetting schemes – which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms. Our travel section is printed and distributed in the UK but our articles online are read by a worldwide audience, so in some instances readers do not need to fly to the places we are writing about.John Vidal’s article about reducing the number of flights we take quotes Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall centre in Manchester: “I don’t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one … If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise we shouldn’t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit.”Returning to that article on Helsinki, there’s another Scandinavian lifestyle trend that has emerged as a positive counterbalance to “flygskam”, and that is “tagskryt” (train brag). Another reader of the article captured its spirit perfectly in the comment: “The journey is the holiday. Just think of all the places you see along the way.”Because, of course, we’ve been doing long-distance slow travel since the 1970s, as was pointed out. That was the decade when the Interrail scheme was launched. And, as Wills said when he revisited the Interrail experience this summer after a 30-year gap: “How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe – delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes.”That is the spirit of adventure we hope you take away with you after reading the travel section."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3858d96ea129929c09d1781ed401f522605d3b80/218_2651_3014_1809/master/3014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32a34a700de9e45906839302b85b17e9","title":"have you spotted any new buds or flowers in october","story":"If you have seen any plants flowering unusually this month, we would like to see your photosAccording to former  environment correspondent Paul Brown, “new research published in Geophysical Research letters show that so-called “cold” days in European winters are on average 3C warmer than 70 years ago”.Some people have reported seeing new flower buds in the unseasonal temperatures, leading to worries the flowers will be killed by the winter weather and may not bloom again in spring.If you have seen any plants with new buds or flowers appearing we would like to hear from you.When did you first see them and do you have any concerns about what it might mean for them come spring?

He was 36 and had a fine career behind him. He could have retired. He could have opted for a sinecure in the Middle East or China. He could have gone into coaching or television punditry. But instead, having spent his entire senior career at Roma, he signed for Boca Juniors.Things haven’t gone according to plan, however. A persistent hamstring injury has restricted him to 334 minutes of football since arriving in July. De Rossi was on the bench for Tuesday’s Copa Libertadores semi-final against River Plate but he did not come on as Boca won 1-0 and went out 2-1 on aggregate. His presence seemed less about him potentially playing than about trying to use his experience to calm others and perhaps even letting him feel a superclásico close up.What is clear is that this is not some ego trip for De Rossi and nor has he come for the money. When he arrived in Buenos Aires after a 13-hour flight, he headed immediately to Boca’s base and trained with the rest of the squad that afternoon. The next day, he turned up at 6am, before anybody else, and put in an order for 100 Boca shirts so he could distribute them among his friends and family.His reasons for feeling such affection for Boca are not entirely clear. It is a club with historical links to Italy – one of their nicknames is Los Xeneizes, the Genovese – but De Rossi’s desire to play for them seems linked more to his respect for Boca’s great icon of the past 30 years, Juan Román Riquelme. He is part of a WhatsApp group with friends whose sole topic of discussion is midfielders the group’s avatar is Riquelme.The danger when such an obvious high-class player arrives is that he might dominate the dressing room or disdain his teammates, but others at the club have been struck by De Rossi’s humility and his commitment in training. His Spanish is decent other than when the talk switches to tactics, when he has to rely on the translation skills of Carlos Tevez, Mauro Zárate and Lisandro López.Perhaps it is down to his lack of pitch time but the most striking aspect of De Rossi’s spell in Argentina is how few ripples he has made. He has done one television interview, and that from the side of the training pitch rather than anything longer and more formal in a studio, and he seems rarely to leave his hotel in the redeveloped waterfront area of Puerto Madero, where he lives alone after his wife and children decided to remain in Rome. The only comment anybody can remember him making about Buenos Aires is to ask why there are so many street protests.De Rossi is highly unusual. He is one of four Europeans playing in the Argentina top-flight, but the other three – José Mauri (Italy), Norberto Briasco (Armenia) and Dylan Gissi (Switzerland) – have Argentinian parents, with the first two being born in Argentina. The first European with no such heritage to sign for an Argentinian club since the Hungarian Ferenc Sas joined Boca in 1938, De Rossi has 117 caps. He was a mainstay of Italy for years.The only player of comparable status to move to Argentina, who was not playing a sentimental final season or two for a former club, is the former France forward David Trezeguet, who played for River Plate and Newell’s Old Boys between 2012 and 2014, but his parents are Argentinian and he grew up in Buenos Aires.That is the grim truth of globalisation, the traffic is almost all one way. In Argentina, they talk of the talent doughnut: anybody of any promise leaves when they are in their teens. Some return in their 30s but anybody who is in their 20s and is playing in the Argentinian league either is not very good or has some particular reason why they cannot travel.Around 1,800 Argentinians are playing abroad. And that, necessarily, has an impact on the quality.Tuesday’s superclásico, for its colour and passion, was a poor game, all free-kicks and corners. Of the impudent creativity of the No 10s, on which the myth of Argentinian football is based, the only trace was the mercurial Colombian Juan Fernando Quintero, who was on the bench for River, but in the circumstances never likely to come on.Despite the poverty of the play – and the dilapidated state of most of the grounds and the continuing threat of violence – Argentina still has the 11th-highest average attendance of any league in the world. Love of the clubs, and perhaps love of the sense of togetherness and common identity that can still be found on the terraces, overrides all else.Or at least that is the romantic explanation. But really, is that saying anything different to the marketing wonk who would about strong brand identification? To western European football, where the money is, where the best football is, Argentina is a market and, in as much as it exists beyond that, it is as a place of theatre, but theatre where the act is in the stand rather than the stage.All those decades of history, the corruption and the crime, the 332 deaths detailed by Salvemos al Fútbol – the Let’s Save Football campaign – memories of a league that at one time was arguably the best in the world, reduced to this. What will survive of us is love? A tourist attraction for wealthier parts of the world? And, yes, I am aware my own presence on Tuesday, the way a video of fans I posted on social media drew thousands of approving views, is part of that dynamic.So, too, for all his good intentions, for all that he is taking it seriously, for all it is refreshing to see a player chasing experience rather than money, is De Rossi. For what is he, really, but a tourist enjoying an end‑of-career gap year?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd18bcb32fc234ffbf47bb4751d1f1302fd8e6da/0_27_2712_1627/master/2712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ec2487192c7f6cd721975a0c364e01e","title":"harry kane spurs out to settle old score with liverpool virgil van dijk","story":"Spurs striker ready for Anfield rematch four months after Liverpool centre-back dominated in Champions League finalWhen they meet again on Sunday afternoon Kane should be at full tilt even if Spurs look some distance short of the side that bounced to Madrid. It was not Kane’s fault he could not deliver when their greatest achievement was in sight but the team’s form offers a convincing argument that Mauricio Pochettino needs him just as badly now. In recent times it has not been easy, when the Spurs manager scans the faces in his dressing room, to work out exactly who he can hang his hat on. But there has never been any doubt about Kane’s fierce commitment to the cause, even when there are those who will happily test the quality of the pegging.Roy Keane was the latest to do that last week, saying Manchester United should “just go and get” Kane. It would not be that simple but the comment reached Pochettino, who sidestepped the suggestion by agreeing with an abstract idea that his centre‑forward “deserves everything”. Few would argue with that. Kane’s determination to haul himself into service and perform when, on occasion, he would have been excused an easier time of things is a burning testament to his character. With that dispiriting night in Madrid a notable exception, he has usually come good when the stakes are at their highest for Tottenham.That includes the time 20 months ago at Anfield when Kane dusted himself down from a penalty miss to hold his nerve for a second spot‑kick and silence the Kop in the fifth minute of stoppage time, scoring his 100th Premier League goal just after Mohamed Salah appeared to have settled the issue for Liverpool. Spurs have not emerged from Liverpool’s home with a win since May 2011, when Kane was still a loanee at Leyton Orient. He has scored there three times, though, and, on the back of a morale-boosting performance in Tuesday’s cakewalk against Red Star Belgrade, his appetite to give Van Dijk a sterner examination is evident.“Van Dijk is a great defender but he is not invincible and Liverpool are not invincible,” Kane said. On the former point he might have been harking back to an occasion in 2015 when he had the then Southampton player on toast at St Mary’s, opening the scoring after Van Dijk had let him in by swinging and missing wildly. Those mistakes might as well be hen’s teeth nowadays but they are also the little morsels of knowledge – like knowing an opponent is clearly unfit – that players cling on to in those moments before knife‑edge confrontations.Kane is predictably keen to minimise scrutiny of the head‑to‑head. “From my point of view it’s just about playing my game and making my movements, doing my runs and trying to get on the scoresheet, trying to get assists,” he said. In midweek he scored twice and for long periods dropped deep to act as a de facto playmaker. It was probably his best performance of the campaign, albeit against a poor side that offered none of the resistance Liverpool will present, and although there have been Tottenham players in far worse form it felt like a timely return to something approaching his maximum efficiency.Kane’s figures have largely been down so far this season and, with Spurs grinding rather than flowing for the most part, that is little surprise. Opta statistics present an expected goals per game tally of 0.36 in the Premier League so far, by a considerable distance his lowest under Pochettino the fact that his goal return of 0.56 per game (five in nine), although again on course to be his worst in a single season since 2013-14, comfortably exceeds that suggests the basics are still in good working order. But the numbers also show Kane is creating fewer chances, touching the ball less, engaging in fewer duels and winning a smaller percentage of them than at any point in the Argentinian’s tenure. It is not to say that his performances have been poor rather, that the side’s wider malaise is doing few favours to the man everyone expects to keep on producing.On Friday, Pochettino rejected the notion that three points at Anfield would constitute a reset for his squad a feat that might clear a few heads and persuade a few, inside and outside the club, that Spurs can still mix it with the very best. The idea was strange, he said, given they had already drawn at Manchester City and Arsenal. At the Emirates they frittered away a two‑goal lead, though, and since then the scars from Leicester, Brighton, Bayern Munich, Watford and even Colchester have mounted up.It all carries a faint resemblance to the autumn of 2016, when Spurs did not win in seven games before Kane – who was, familiarly, only just coming back from an ankle injury – turned a defeat into victory against West Ham with two goals at the very end. Pushing on to finish second in the league, as they did then, would be a remarkable feat in the current climate. “Momentum‑wise, it would give us a huge lift,” Kane said of any win against the undefeated league leaders. Through all this year’s doubt and confusion, he remains the player best placed to deliver it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/057a5540e8fe445ad9b0250bb33274249d00c2af/0_2409_3827_2296/master/3827.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79952600303d3732ebf0634f0ca9b30c","title":"a touch of magic for an old rectory","story":"‘Modest’ decor lets the elegant interior architecture of an 1840 rectory in Cheltenham shineShe is the designer who made bunting, table confetti and cake toppers staples of party decorating. Yet you’re unlikely to have heard of Meredithe Stuart-Smith. The US-born entrepreneur began her business at a glitter-strewn kitchen table in 1985. The luxury department store Bergdorf Goodman, in New York, was her first client and she has been quietly busy ever since. Today, Meri Meri stationery, homewares, toys and reusable party trimmings, in her trademark pastels and neons, line the shelves of stores across the world.“I’ve always designed for parents like me, who want to add a bit of magic to their children’s lives,” says Stuart-Smith, a mother of two. Many of those designs began here in the Cheltenham home she shares with her husband and grown-up son (her daughter now works in Birmingham). The four-bedroom property is set in a stucco-fronted 1840 rectory, which was sliced into three apartments in the 1950s. “The proportions are grand, but it’s not an overly elaborate house,” says Stuart-Smith, who has kept the decor accordingly “modest”. Walls are washed in a concert of bluey-whites the original, wonky floorboards painted a shiny cocoa brown. Like her designs, the charm of this house lies in the details: a row of Surrealist plates, the swan-shaped cushion afloat on a petite sofa. “I’m drawn to things that are clean-lined, with a bit of fun thrown in,” she enthuses. “I love wallpaper and colour, but I couldn’t live with that intensity. I like to be able to see the wood through the leaves.”Stuart-Smith and her English husband, who runs a medical equipment business, moved here 20 years ago, lured by good schools, the cheese shop and the curative waters. “I’ve always liked the idea of living in a spa town.” The three-storey property, with its views of the park and creamy sweeps of Regency terraces, needed a great deal of work, which they tackled floor by floor. “The last owner had lived here for 50 years so we had to do everything. Wiring, plumbing, new bathrooms. We did the renovation in stages, moving from room to room like nomads.”She added the new double doors that lead to the sitting room. The shutters and fireplace are original, but the hearth is made from aubergine slate, originally used as the surface of a billiards table. The ceiling soars to almost 3m high but, like everything in this household, nothing is too formal or overdone. Gilded mirrors are propped nonchalantly against walls, mismatching rugs scattered across floors.The dining table, the setting for countless birthday parties, is Habitat the Philippe Starck chairs, in a loud Missoni print, add requisite fun to the all-white setting. Instead of a “zillion dollar” chandelier, a friend made a pendant light in the hallway from cardboard rolls wrapped in brown paper, for retro effect.Stuart-Smith, who moved to the UK in 1996, has always travelled light. The few possessions that this low-key creative does have are treasured not for their value but for their meaning. “Almost everything here tells a story,” she says.The steamer-trunk coffee table came from her first apartment in San Francisco. “I always think about replacing it with something fabulous, but I can’t seem to do it.” Upstairs, the Victorian sofa belonged to her husband’s family and doubled as a bed on their voyages to and from India. Some of her favourite pieces are the portraits of Native Americans by Leonard Baskin, a US-born academic and artist, who moved his family to Devon to be close to his friend, the poet Ted Hughes. “I’ve been collecting his work for 20 years,” says Stuart-Smith. “It keeps me grounded.”Art, interiors and fashion have always influenced her designs. It is what sets Meri Meri pieces apart and explains why Victoria Beckham has one of Stuart-Smith’s sparkly reindeer backpacks and Sarah Jessica Parker was spotted assembling a Meri Meri flamingo piñata on Instagram. “Couture” fancy dress – swan capes, tulle skirts – is a recent addition to the range. “Last year I went to the Heavenly Bodies show at the Met and found the perfect idea for our angel wings,” she says. “The Mary Quant exhibition, at the V\u0026ampA flooded me with ideas for ’70s-inspired patterns.

But Aaron Wainwright, who will, was not one of them. When he was little he wanted to be a professional footballer. He spent six years in Cardiff FC’s academy, learning to be a defensive midfielder, “a Roy Keane type, I loved to get stuck in”.They dropped him when he was 16. Newport County offered him a scholarship but he did not want to move from Bassaleg School. Instead he decided to take up another invitation, from his mates who asked him to come play a game of rugby with them down at Whitehead.That was six years ago. The last time Wales played in the knockout rounds of the World Cup, that oh-so-close four-point loss to the Springboks in the quarter‑finals in 2015, it would have seemed impossible to him, and everyone else, that he would be playing for them now. Back then they had a back row of Dan Lydiate, Sam Warburton and Taulupe Faletau, one of the finest combinations Wales have put together, all in their 20s then, but none of them made it to Japan. It tells you a lot about Wainwright’s gifts that Wales have been able to get by without them, and even more about Warren Gatland’s.Gatland called up Wainwright in the summer of 2018. Wainwright should have been playing for Cardiff politan University, where he was studying for a sport science degree. He had been plugging away for the student XV, training two nights a week and fitting in a team run between lectures.He spent his Wednesdays galloping around in Bucs Super Rugby, and his Saturday “up to my knees in mud” getting “beaten up by big men” in the WRU Championship, away days at “Glynneath, Narberth Bedlinog, the sort of places you don’t want to go to”.Everything changed in September 2017, the day he had to give a coaching demonstration as part of his coursework. He received a phone call while he was waiting to go in from the Dragons head coach, Bernard Jackman. The club had suffered a sudden run of injuries and needed him on the bench for their game against the Southern Kings in the Pro 14.He did not go on, but did the next week, for the last 10 minutes of a 14-point defeat at the Cardiff Blues. “That was a massive step for me,” he says. “It was then I realised it was going to be a lot more serious than I thought it would be.”Wainwright ended up playing 25 games for the Dragons that season. The summer after it was over, Gatland gave him 30 minutes at the end of a Test against Argentina in San Juan. He made his first start against Tonga that November and since then he has featured in every Test as a starter or a replacement.In two years, Wainwright has gone from the university first XV to being man of the match in a World Cup quarter-final against France. If you had told him then that how his life was going to play out he says he would have laughed. A lot of his friends still are. “I’m still very friendly with a lot of the boys and they can’t believe how far I’ve come.”A bunch of his old university teammates wanted to come over to support him but their student loans could not cover the airfare. Instead he will go and watch them as soon as he is home. “I can’t wait to get back and watch them playing on a Wednesday night.”Because it is all so close, his ties to the community are pretty tight. He still does a lot of coaching down at Whiteside, using what he learned on his degree course. He was there working with them the night before he flew out to Japan. “Having that relationship is massive. The support they give me as well helps me every week.“Some players come through a system in which they are put in an academy from a young age don’t get that relationship with a grassroots club. I was very fortunate that my local club welcomed me with both arms and I’ve still got a very good relationship with them.”It means he has his feet on the ground, which is one reason why Warburton has suggested Wainwright may make a good captain. Gatland has already persuaded him to take on a leadership role and in the quarter‑final against France you could see him barking orders to teammates.Some of this success is natural talent. His father was a flanker too, for Caerphilly and some is what he has done with it he was 80kg when he went to university but the Dragons wanted him to bulk up, so he worked his way up to 104kg in the next 18 months.But more of it is down to the system Gatland has created. There is a reason they have been able to make it this far even after they have lost key players to injuries and it is because they can spot the potential in a player such as Wainwright and given him everything he needs to help him fulfil it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1086bd4478dd4205393b51dce31affabec7e5fd9/0_55_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2846d30035824d85812ac25a339f47b1","title":"josh taylor regis prograis world boxing super series final","story":"Scotland’s Josh Taylor became the unified world champion of the super-lightweight ision with a majority decision win over Regis Prograis in a thrilling contest at the O2 Arena.

The Edinburgh fighter now holds the WBC, WBA and IBF titles, the Ring Magazine belt and World Boxing Super Series Ali Trophy.Taylor told Sky Sports: “What a fight. Regis is a great champion, but the best man won. He was very good, very strong and had good timing, but I knew I could get to him inside. He lived up to his name and he is a great fighter. I knew I could beat him with the jab alone, but he had me himself so respect to him.”Prograis said: “The better man won on the night. No excuses, but I will be back. I am pretty sure Josh enjoyed it, hopefully we can do part two.”The London heavyweight Dereck Chisora delighted his home crowd on the undercard with a technical knockout victory over David Price in the fourth round. Chisora dominated from the first bell and almost finished the Liverpudlian at the end of the third.Price was saved by the bell but he was dropped in the fourth by a body shot and his corner made the decision to throw in the towel not long after. Chisora said: “I am an old boy in this game. I came to destroy. I knew if I caught him, he was gone.”Joseph Parker was Chisora’s original scheduled opponent before the New Zealander pulled out due to illness. Chisora said: “David Price stepped up to save the show so shout out to David Price, his family and his team. Joseph Parker pulled out and David stepped up.“If we can get Joseph Parker as soon as possible – I hope he doesn’t get a spider bite – let’s do it as soon as possible.” But Chisora’s manager David Haye added: “I’d like the Oleksandr Usyk fight.

Less than two hours later however, England confirmed that Spencer will replace Heinz in the 31-man squad when he arrives in Japan on Tuesday.Spencer has only three caps to his name, all as a replacement, and he has never tasted victory with England - featuring in two defeats as well as the 38-38 draw with Scotland in March – which is his most recent appearance. It is some ask for the 27-year-old to join the squad for England’s biggest match for 12 years.He was due to start for Saracens in the Premiership on Sunday but will now join the squad, who are now one win away from emulating Sir Clive Woodward’s 2003 World Cup winners. It gives Spencer the opportunity to make up for the disappointment of missing out on the initial squad. He had edged ahead of Dan Robson and Danny Care in the pecking order, only for Heinz to emerge as Jones’s choice as Ben Youngs’ understudy.Along with Youngs, Heinz was one of just two scrum-halves in England’s World Cup squad, meaning Spencer is set for a place on the bench in Saturday’s final. Jones admitted he was taking a risk when naming only two scrum-halves in his 31-man squad back in August and said that George Ford could act as emergency cover if required.

This wasn’t a loss due to a controversial ref call or dirty play from the opposition. This was defeat in the face of greatness.Immigration minister Iain Less-Galloway summed up the mood of the nation when he tweeted on Sunday: “1) The better team won. Congrats to England. They were superior in every facet \u0026amp deserved victory. 2) The All Blacks lost with dignity \u0026amp grace even though it hurt like hell. 3) It’s good for the game to see more teams capable of winning the World Cup. Go Wales!”The Herald on Sunday, the country’s largest Sunday paper, turned its entire front page black, and in small print declared gently: “The All Blacks are out of the World Cup. If you want to read more, go to the sports section.”England’s superior play was warmly acknowledged by New Zealanders – and humour emerged amidst the hangovers, as well as a genuine respect for Eddie Jones’ side, who All Blacks coach Steve Hansen has described as “tremendous”.The country’s national Sunday tabloid, The Sunday Star Times, devoted its front page to a bloodied picture of All Black TJ Perenara, under the headline “Yoko, Oh no”, describing the loss as a “horror show”.But retired Auckland rugby player Ben Atiga urged New Zealand to take the defeat on the chin – and get the ball out on Sunday morning as a way to ease the pain.“It’s over, life isn’t,” Atiga tweeted. “Get the ball out and chuck it around. Spark up the feed and put on the jams. Have a laugh.”Will Nelson, 27, of the North Island, said the loss hadn’t hurt as much expected – a sentiment expressed around the country, where sometimes defeat can result in a depressed national mood that lingers for days.“I’m not feeling too bad to be honest. I’m usually really nervous watching the All Blacks but I wasn’t yesterday because I never really felt like we were in the game,” said Nelson.“I’m a bit gutted the All Blacks didn’t play better as it could have been an epic contest but they didn’t seem to turn up for the game – I thought England were pretty incredible.”Amidst the gracious and moderate reactions of most , the opposition National MP Judith Collins took the opportunity to take a dig, tweeting that an All Blacks World Cup defeat “Never happened when we were in Govt” .The National party leader, Simon Bridges, was praised for summing up the mood of the nation with his simple, unadorned response to the loss: “Bugger”.Not all New Zealanders took it so well. One note of discord was the vandalism of a vehicle in Auckland. Painted up in the colours of the Union Jack, the mini has its windows smashed in outside a Devonport pub.The incident appeared to be isolated however, with New Zealand police reporting a “fairly routine” Saturday night around the country, in terms of violence and family-harm incidents. Busy, as weekends always are, “but not out of the ordinary in terms of incidents or demand”.Following significant All Blacks losses, sports analysts and the national media usually dissect in earnest what went wrong, who is to blame, and who should take the fall for it. The All Blacks’ dominance on the rugby world stage is part of New Zealand’s appeal as a tourist destination – “the home of rugby” – and losses can have financial consequences too.But this time around, the blame-game was unusually muted.At the New Zealand Herald, its sports desk compiled the top five reasons the All Blacks lost, and in top billing was the simple reason “1. England simply too good”, followed closely by “Scoreboard pressure” and “Eddie Jones”.At New Zealand’s largest news website, Stuff, Sir Ian McGeechan wrote that he’d never seen the All Blacks so outplayed – putting the spotlight on England’s talent, rather than the All Blacks deficiencies.“This was a technical and tactical masterclass in which England had a complete appreciation of what they were trying to achieve. Eddie Jones, take a bow,” McGeechan wrote.Stuff’s national RWC Mood-O Meter – which was clocked at “no worries” on Friday afternoon, had swung to “gutted” by Sunday morning.But considering the passion many New Zealanders have for the game – often described as the national religion – it was a “gutted” mired in respect, resignation, and continued love for a game that can surprise and even delight a country so used to world domination."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d2eeee33eab790c40d84a32b1458849af9d01fb/0_250_5057_3036/master/5057.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35485d1a6c4a1ac83668868903025aeb","title":"houston astros washington nationals world series game 4 baseball","story":"Alex Bregman broke loose on Saturday night, putting the Houston Astros ahead with an RBI single in the first inning before launching a grand slam in the seventh to lead an 8-1 romp over Washington in Game 4 of the World Series. Holding his bat high, Bregman took a half-dozen steps down the first-base line, watching his game-breaking slam sail over the fences. He added a late single for good measure as the Astros pulled even in the series, 2-2.A day earlier, the regular season MVP candidate was hitless in five-bats, stranding six runners and plunging him to 1 for 13 in the Series. Bregman wasn’t daunted and showed why he’s among the most self-assured players in baseball.Bregman said he felt good swings coming. Asked about his teammate, Michael Brantley echoed that. “I’m not worried about Alex,” Brantley said after a 4-1 win on Friday night. “He’ll find his breaks. I can’t wait to see him come out tomorrow, I’m ready. You be ready, too.”It didn’t take long: Bregman pounced on the first pitch he saw, and the Astros led the rest of the way. Bregman delivered in a ballpark where he’s had success, and in a city where his family has a legacy.Last year, Bregman’s leadoff home run in the 10th inning at Nationals Park sent the American League to an 8-6 win and earned him the All-Star Game MVP award. A half-century ago, his grandfather was general counsel for the Washington Senators, the team that moved to become the Texas Rangers for the 1971 season, leaving the nation’s capital without the national pastime until the Montreal Expos came in 2005.The 25-year-old third baseman hit 41 homers with 112 RBIs this season. But with the Astros aiming to add to the championship they won in 2017, he’d been stuck in neutral this week, aside from a home run in a 12-3 loss in Game 2. Even his usually sure-handed defense at third base had been subpar.Bregman quickly got in gear on Saturday though. After Jose Altuve and Brantley singled with one out in the first off Patrick Corbin, Bregman lined a single to left-center for a 1-0 lead. Yuli Gurriel followed with an RBI single, and a pocket of Houston fans in the third deck began their chant of “Let’s go, Astros!”Bregman ended any doubt about Houston winning with his slam, a deep drive off Fernando Rodney that easily cleared the left-field wall. Bregman enjoyed the trip around the bases, and Astros teammates spilled from the dugout to greet him. Back on the bench, he held up four fingers. And way up above the right field foul pole, the cheer got louder and louder from the Astros fans: “MVP! MVP!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/976317beb8ad0e54169405000d5af4233b880234/47_1665_3425_2055/master/3425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dedd678e951cdfd4086ff3467602b64","title":"for all the women who thought they were mad theatre review","story":"Stoke Newington Town Hall, London N16A hard-hitting and sometimes humorous look at the prejudices black women experience in a cut-throat workplaceHackney-born actor-turned-playwright Zawe Ashton’s first play explores the experiences of black women in the corporate workplace, taking in issues surrounding natural hair, traditional clothing, single-motherhood and mental health along the way. For Joy (Mina Andala), who has worked for a cut-throat corporation for a decade, the scariest thing in her life when the play opens is trying to get a promotion. But there’s a storm coming and, as the sound of rain echoes around the stage, five mysterious women and a child are frantically trying to protect her.These women jump in and out of Joy’s life, assuming different identities. Her mother (Jumoké Fashola), her aunt (Janet Kumah), a colleague (Layo-Christina Akinlude) and child (Rae Ann Quayle) and her babysitter (Jennifer Dixon) are all involved. What are they protecting her from? The threats in Joy’s life are palpable: her white male boss (Michael Fitzgerald) who thinks it’s OK to openly say women like Joy – black women – always smell of coconut oil the unexpected pregnancy that threatens her promotion plans trying to maintain a relationship with “home” having an “English” name because her real name is just too complicated for people to pronounce. The pressure becomes too much for Joy to handle.One of the most culturally striking and funny scenes shows Joy and an African cleaner (Joy Elias-Rilwan), who is also one of the protective figures, connect while having a conversation about tribal medicines and their contrasting jobs for the same company. Ashton and director Jo McInnes address these topics in a stimulating and imaginative way, although a side plot about a child who was thought to be a witch in Africa lacks the nuance and subtlety of the rest of the play.The play is poetic, and questions how black women must balance conflicting expectations from their bosses and their culture. The answer? To do so in a world that hasn’t been constructed to support such women can be maddening."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b44615c122e821e84ede767a88d2ed018cfd0c9/205_358_3107_1864/master/3107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=544b8d6a7fb06f0ce7c94b4d3ca81ef4","title":"china technology social management internet social credit system","story":"China’s use of technology for social control of its citizens is extensive – but it could affect users elsewhere too, says security analyst Samantha HoffmanSamantha Hoffman is an analyst of Chinese security issues at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (Aspi).

If you go back to even the late 1970s and early 80s, the way the Chinese Communist party (CCP) talks about technology is as a tool of social management. It’s a way of not only coercive control, but also sort of cooperative control where you participate in your own management. It’s this idea of shaping the environment, shaping how people think, how they’re willing to act before they even know they’re making a choice. That’s the party’s idea.When did that develop into what is called the social credit system?Former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin spoke about this in 2000. He said we need a social credit system to merge rule by law and rule by virtue. I don’t see it as different from the way Hannah Arendt describes how regimes attempt to make the law inseparable from ethics in The Origins of Totalitarianism.How does the social credit system work for the average citizen? As they are going about their lives, are they continually earning and losing points based on their behaviour?A pop cultural reference might be the Black Mirror episode Nosee. But it isn’t the same. It’s not really a number score that goes up and down. There are multiple inputs. So you have, say, legal inputs, like a court record, and financial inputs. Then there are third-party inputs, such as surveillance video or data about your sentiment on social media. The system includes blacklists, records on public websites, and platforms to support decisions on creditworthiness that integrate things like “sentiment analysis”. This applies to companies and iniduals. Muji’s Shanghai branch had a mark of dishonesty on its credit record with the Shanghai government because one of its products was labelled “Made in Taiwan”.The number of people affected is enormous: 17.5 million people were prevented from buying flights in 2018. Is there much pushback from the Chinese population about this system?An average person might not see how it’s affecting them yet. Social credit is technology augmenting existing control methods. So if you’re used to that system, you aren’t necessarily seeing the change yet. Blacklists aren’t new, but the technology supporting this social management is. And over time, as it becomes more effective, that’s where more people will notice the impact.So there isn’t much concept of user privacy or anonymising data in China?Privacy matters to the average Chinese citizen and there are privacy regulations in place. But privacy stops where the party’s power begins. And so, you know, the party state might put controls on how companies can share data. But again privacy stops where the party’s power begins. And that’s a huge difference in the system.One thing that’s interesting to keep in mind is the system itself. When we think about China’s authoritarianism, we think about surveillance cameras, we think about facial recognition. But we forget that a lot of the technology involved provides convenience. And control happens for convenience. Some of the technologies involved in increasing the party’s power are actually providing services – maybe Mussolini and his timely trains is a useful way of thinking about it.Is the wider Chinese population aware of how the technology is being used in Xinjiang? Do they realise this is a more enhanced version of what we’ve got in their own lives?I don’t think people are aware of how bad it is. A lot of people don’t believe Western reporting. If they see it. Even if they do believe it, propaganda has shaped a bad public opinion of the Uighurs.Do you think the Chinese Communist party has a file on you?I imagine that they probably have a file on a lot of outspoken researchers. I try not to think about what the what mine would look like. In general, a lot of researchers on China have a fear, whether it’s conscious or unconscious, about losing access or the ability to go to China.You have written about your fears that a commercial deal struck between Huawei and a Turkish mobile operator could be used to monitor the exiled Uighur population in Turkey.Chinese tech giants like Huawei are signing agreements for smart cities globally – in April we at Aspi counted 75. These agreements include public security, licence-plate and facial recognition tools. As a local government you’re taking what is the cheapest and best product for your city. You’re deploying it in ways you’ve decided are reasonable, but what might be forgotten is that these services require data to be sent back to the company to keep it up to date – and who else has access to that data once the manufacturer has it? One agreement was made with Turkish mobile provider Turkcell. Turkey has about 10,000 Uighurs living in exile – that system could be used to further control and harass exiles and family members in China.More generally, I found that the party central propaganda department has made cooperation agreements with a number of major Chinese tech companies. As their products are bedded in they become ways of collecting tons of data. A language translation tool, for instance, doesn’t sound like a surveillance tool but it’s a way to collect a lot of data. Technically it’s not different from what Google does but their intent is different – it’s about state security.So western governments should be wary of installing Chinese-designed tech infrastructure in their cities?Yes. It’s perhaps uncomfortable for a lot of people to acknowledge, but the party is very clear about its intent. Its intent relates to state security. The party talks about “discourse power” – the party’s version of the truth being the only thing that’s accepted. The Chinese government ultimately controls all Chinese companies through its security legislation. You might be comfortable with someone collecting data to tailor advertising to you, but are you comfortable with sharing your data with a regime that has 1.5 million Uighurs imprisoned on the basis of their ethnic identity?So we should be cautious about buying Chinese smartphones and smart home products?I would be. You may think “I’m not researching the CCP or testifying in Congress, so I don’t have anything to worry about”. But you don’t really know how that data is being collected and potentially used to shape your opinion and shape your decisions, among other things. Even understanding advertising and consumer preferences can feed into propaganda. Taken together, that can be used to influence an election or feelings about a particular issue.Some of these elements of monitoring and nudging are present in western life. For instance, fitness tracking that earns you discounts on health insurance, or local authorities using machine learning to identify potential abuse victims. Should we be careful about letting this stuff into society?We need to be very careful. It’s easy to see what the benefits are, but we aren’t adequately defining the risks. Some of the problems can be dealt with by introducing more data literacy programmes, so that iniduals understand, say, the privacy issues concerning a home-security camera.The Chinese party state is going to take advantage of the weaknesses in liberal democracies, whether they’re legal or cultural. They take advantage of our really weak data privacy laws. GDPR is a good step, but it doesn’t really deal with the core problem of technology that’s providing a service. By its nature the company providing the service collects and uses data. Who has access to that data, their ability to process it, and their intent is the problem."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebb9361b58ca804e5860beafe79ce4bd97b849e2/0_34_839_503/master/839.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5bc4196a853268620372759e75ac96a","title":"facebook lindsey graham green new deal ad","story":"Ad, which ran Friday, was put up as a stunt by a left-leaning PAC to test Facebook political ad policiesFacebook said on Saturday it had removed an ad that falsely claimed that Republican senator Lindsey Graham supported the Green New Deal, demonstrating that it will fact-check ads from political groups but not politicians.The ad, which ran on Friday, was put up as a stunt by a left-leaning political action committee, or PAC, called The Really Online Lefty League, to test Facebook’s political ad policies.Facebook has been criticized over its decision to not fact-check ads run by politicians, drawing ire from Democrats running for the 2020 presidential nomination such as the former vice-president Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren.Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, has defended Facebook’s policy, saying that the company did not want to stifle political speech.The Facebook spokesman Tom Channick told Reuters on Friday that since the new ad came from a political action group, rather than a politician, it was eligible for review by third-party factchecking partners.At the time of writing, the video could still be viewed on the PAC’s Facebook page, but paid distribution had been stopped.The ad came days after the Democratic representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez grilled Zuckerberg on whether Facebook would permit her to run such an ad, during a congressional hearing on Wednesday.Adriel Hampton, the treasurer of The Really Online Lefty League, said the Graham ad was inspired by the exchange.Graham’s office said it was aware of the ad and confirmed the senator opposes the Green New Deal, a proposal championed by Ocasio-Cortez that would eliminate US greenhouse gas emissions within a decade.Facebook and other social media companies are under pressure to police misinformation on their platforms during the run-up to the November 2020 election.On Friday, Facebook started to test Facebook News, a new section of its mobile app dedicated to “high-quality news”. But the company came under fire from some political activists over its decision to include the rightwing news website Breitbart News as one of its Facebook News publishers.Facebook said Breitbart is an unpaid partner, unlike some outlets in the section. Breitbart News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Facebook News will feature content from almost 200 publishers including the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post.A Facebook spokeswoman told Reuters that if any Facebook News publisher posts misinformation, the publisher would no longer be eligible for Facebook News."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5100d6d04f5edcba684b123477260c54228dc7c6/344_759_4506_2704/master/4506.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca2ac4b3197f045b7d0050418f7b1a1b","title":"share tip pilgrim trail europe win 200 pound hotel voucher","story":"Routes all over the UK and Europe follow paths established by pilgrims centuries ago.

From travel apps and carbon calculators to free public transport, here’s how you can make a differenceIndustry experts believe that a nationwide transport revolution is required to mitigate the climate crisis, and that smart technology could transform the way we travel. Travel apps are making sustainable transport options more accessible to the growing number of people keen to change their travel plans to reduce their environmental impact.Tools include the calculator at EcoPassenger, which directly compares energy consumption and carbon emissions of planes, cars and trains for any journey. Meanwhile, Lime’s new electric bike and scooter sharing scheme is taking off in London and Milton Keynes, and Europe’s leading train and coach app, Trainline, is making greener travel more hassle-free for customers globally by investing in technology to help make train and coach travel across 45 countries more accessible. “Our long-term vision is to enable everyone to travel from A to B much faster and more efficiently, in a way that’s better for the environment,” says Clare Gilmartin, CEO of Trainline. “We use artificial intelligence and advanced mobile technology so that, via our app, customers can travel by train and coach seamlessly, with on-the-go access to real-time journey information, using digital tickets to skip queues and with access to clever features like BusyBot, which harnesses crowdsourced data to help people find a seat on a busy train. We believe smart tech has a crucial role to play in encouraging and enabling people to travel sustainably.”The government has invested £1.5bn in grants between 2015 and 2020 for electric plug-in vehicles and schemes to kickstart the rollout of charge-point infrastructure, while pledging that all new cars and vans should be zero-emission by 2040, according to its Road to Zero strategy. Childs insists this is not enough: “The only way we can make the scale of reductions we need fast enough is by having a revolution in transportation.”Lisbon has one of the world’s largest electric vehicle charging point networks, while Estonia and Luxembourg have introduced countrywide free public transport. “Free public transport is transformational, not only for the environment – it’s also socially progressive,” adds Childs. Trainline found that a quarter of young Brits would reduce time behind the wheel to be more sustainable, and Friends of the Earth is calling for the government to make bus travel free to under-30s to reduce the need for young people to buy cars and help people switch to public transport.By driving positive change through technology, travel apps help create a more sustainable and efficient transport infrastructure, enabling a smoother transition to lower carbon-impact travel, within the UK and beyond.Book travel in and across 45 countries today with Trainline, Europe’s leading train and coach app"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58c0f14c375f014dbb2e32b4cec28918b11daf77/227_320_4836_2902/master/4836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eeeecb8be7305c2efcd9f68dd033bfb7","title":"rail adventures five scenic european journeys to savour","story":"With train travel often more sustainable than driving or flying, now’s the time to leave the car at home. Swap the road for the rails, as Nick Inman provides some of the best train trips in the UK and mainland EuropeRail’s sustainability credentials mean it’s a no-brainer to swap the stress of the airport and traffic jams for the more scenic and greener option. With Europe’s extensive rail network ready to take you directly from city centre to city centre or guide you through some of the best scenery on offer, forget flying or driving, hop on the train. You could stay in Britain and explore unfamiliar parts of the country you don’t normally get to see, or you could take the Eurostar from London to mainland Europe and connect with an international system of high-speed trains and quaint branch lines.Rail is convenient, competitively priced and environmentally friendly. It’s also a reminder that travel is as much about the journey as the destination. It allows you to slow down and think.What are you waiting for?Here are five routes – two at home, three abroad – to get you started. All can be booked through Trainline’s app or website.Glasgow to Mallaig via Fort WilliamIf you want to get kids used to travelling by train, take them north to see the magnificent curving viaduct of Glenfinnan, which is used to carry the Hogwarts Express in the Harry Potter films. The West Highland line is regularly described as one of the most scenic in the British Isles, if not the world (beating even the Trans-Siberian), being a procession of mouthwatering lochs, moors and mountains. From Mallaig you can take ferries to several of the islands of the Inner Hebrides.Getting to Glasgow: you have a choice of trains from London (or other mainline stations in Britain).Typical journey time: Glasgow to Mallaig, 5 hours 16 minutes direct.Nice (Provence, France) to Pisa (Tuscany, Italy)Steep wooded hills tumble into the sea all along the beautiful coast of Liguria from the French border near Ventimiglia to the ancient port city of Genoa and beyond. This trip makes a relaxing way to get to Tuscany along the Riviera. If you are tempted to break up the journey, you may want to visit the resorts of San Remo or Portofino, or one of the dramatically sited and colourful towns of the Cinque Terre.Getting to Nice: take the Eurostar and change at Paris Gare du NordParis Gare de Lyon.Typical journey time: 6 hours 30 minutes, with one or two changes at Ventimiglia andor Genova.Vienna to Klagenfurt via the Semmering PassThis trans-Alpine line was built in 1854 to link the capital of imperial Austria with the Mediterranean. It was a huge engineering achievement and set the standard for mountain railways, for which it has been declared a world heritage site. Take a seat on the left side of the train by preference. The views are superb as you cross the 895-metre (2,900 ft) Semmering Pass, the highlight of the journey. You can extend your trip via Villach to reach Venice: travelling from central to southern Europe in one exhilarating journey.To get to Vienna: take the Eurostar and change at Brussels and Frankfurt.Typical journey time: Vienna to Klagenfurt, 3 hours 55 minutes direct.Leeds to Carlisle via SettleIt has been described as the line that should never have been built, being a technical challenge that was financially ruinous and costly in the lives of navvies. When it was threatened with closure in the 1980s, the Settle-Carlisle line was rediscovered by train lovers, day-trippers and hill walkers and given a second life. Leaving industrial West Yorkshire, climb into the Yorkshire Dales national park via the Ribblehead viaduct to reach the highest mainline station in England, Dent, at an altitude of 350 metres (1,150 ft). Great views of the austere Pennines are guaranteed.Getting to Leeds: there are plenty of high-speed mainline trains from London.Typical journey time: Leeds to Carlisle, 2 hours 40 minutes direct.Cologne to MainzFancy a river cruise through the Rhine Gorge – only, by train? There are railway lines on both banks of the river, giving splendid views of the gorge, which stretches for 40 miles between Koblenz and Bingen. The east bank line is more scenic, but not as well-serviced as the western side, which has a wider choice of trains – so take the west-bank mainline through Bonn. Or, if you don’t mind taking a slightly more circuitous route, you could go down one and back up the other. Either way, en route are innumerable magnificent castles – whether real, mock or ruined – and pretty villages with half-timbered houses.To get to Cologne: take the Eurostar from London St Pancras and change at Brussels.Typical journey time: Cologne to Mainz, 1 hour 40 minutes.Journey times and ticket prices vary according to which particular options you choose.Ticket to rideIt is easy to book the train for your next adventure.

The proposal, while limited to remote areas in South America and to married men already ordained as deacons in the church, is seen by many as setting a precedent that could bring an end to the restriction on married Catholic priests throughout the world.The proposals were contained in a final document approved yesterday at the end of a three-week synod on the Amazon held at the Vatican. The synod was called by Pope Francis in 2017 to focus attention on saving the rainforest and better ministering to its indigenous peoples.The document approved by the bishops noted that people of Catholic faith in the region have “enormous difficulties” in receiving communion and seeing a priest. It proposed to “ordain priests suitable and esteemed men of the community”, who had already had “fruitful” experiences as deacons and who “receive an adequate formation for the priesthood, having a legitimately constituted and stable family”.The celibate priesthood has been a tradition since the 11th century, imposed in part for financial reasons to ensure priests’ assets pass to the church and not to their heirs. Married priests are permitted in some eastern Catholic churches as well as where married Anglican priests have converted.Reformers say the change is crucial to meet the needs of the pan-Amazonian region but acknowledge it could lead to similar reforms elsewhere. Shortages of priests are so bad that some Amazon communities go months without a proper mass.Speaking afterwards, the pope said he would reopen the work of a 2016 commission that studied the issue of women deacons. He promised that the Vatican would continue to study the role of women in the early years of the church. “We still haven’t grasped the significance of women in the church. Their role must go well beyond questions of function,” he said.Some conservatives and traditionalists warn that any papal opening to married priests or women deacons would lead the church to ruin. They accused the synod organisers, and even the pope himself, of heresy for even considering flexibility on mandatory priestly celibacy.The celibacy idea was supported 128-41 by the bishops. The report noted that some participants wanted a more “universal approach”, suggesting support for married priests elsewhere in the world.The pope, who is from Argentina, has long said he appreciates the discipline and the gift of celibacy, but that it can change, given that it is not doctrine.Bishops in the Amazon say Protestant and evangelical churches are wooing away Catholic souls in the absence of vibrant communities where the Eucharist can be regularly celebrated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa197184bf991f06b96f68a74fb9a523586b13b4/0_295_1797_1078/master/1797.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6b6e1db65baab88bfe0551b6ba758a6","title":"this is the golden age eastern europes extraordinary 30 year revival","story":"Not everything is perfect – as reflected in political flux – but the region is wealthier and healthier than ever beforeMaciej Grabski looks out over a panoramic view of the Baltic Sea, from the 32nd floor of the Olivia Star tower in Gdańsk, Poland.“My children never saw the dark, devastated atmosphere that I remember from the 1980s,” he says. “Many people take things for granted now.”The tower, built by Grabski’s construction company, is the centrepiece of a new business development on the outskirts of Gdańsk, and filled with the offices of multinational companies. It is next door to the squat, concrete Olivia sports hall, where the Solidarity trade union movement held its first congress in 1981, heralding the beginning of the end for communism in the region.The economic demands of Solidarity, which had sprung up at the huge Gdańsk shipyard and was led by Lech Wałęsa, rippled through Poland and then the rest of central and eastern Europe during the 1980s. By the end of the decade, borders were open, regimes collapsed and the Berlin Wall, concrete symbol of 45 years of European ision, was being pulled down.What happened next was extraordinary, painful and unpredictable, as an entire region lurched into uncharted territory. Progress was fitful, messy and often unevenly distributed, sowing the seeds in some countries for the recent rise of populism.But 30 years on from the heady days of autumn 1989, a range of metrics demonstrate that the transition from communism to capitalism has been a remarkable success.Central and eastern Europe over the past 30 years has witnessed one of the most dramatic economic spurts of growth that any region of the world has ever experienced. People live longer, healthier lives. Air quality is better, and iniduals are on average twice as wealthy.“This is the golden age for the region,” says Marcin Piatkowski, a Polish economist who recently authored a book called Europe’s Growth Champion, about the meteoric rise of Poland’s economy over the past three decades. “The whole region has been successful, as reflected in the fact that on average, no Bulgarian, or Romanian or Pole has ever lived better than they do now, both in absolute terms and in relative terms compared to the west.”Such optimism often feels misplaced, given that many people in the region still feel left behind. But the statistics show that since 1990, the Polish and Slovak economies have grown more than sevenfold, and those of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and the Czech Republic more than fivefold.At the same time, the nations remain some of the most equal in the world, as measured by the Gini coefficient (one of the leading measures of wealth distribution).Grabski, born in Gdańsk in 1968, has a story similar to many of the generation of Polish entrepreneurs in the years after the collapse of communism. Young and enthusiastic as the transition came, he eagerly sought out any economic opportunities going. His first business involved repeated trips to Hamburg, where he would sleep in the car and return with a carload of spare automobile parts, which he could sell on for a profit. Later, he invested money in an internet startup, and then into construction. He now runs one of the city’s biggest companies.The “shock therapy” reforms that speedily pushed Poland and other countries in the region into capitalism have come in for criticism, but Leszek Balcerowicz, the architect of Poland’s reforms, still believes they were the best option for the country in the circumstances. “If you move fast from a bad system to a better one, you release new forces for growth,” he says in an interview at the Warsaw School of Economics, where he is now a professor.While communism left the region an economic basket case, it did also provide some of the seeds for growth: well-educated societies with low levels of inequality. And crucially, unlike in Russia and Ukraine, central European countries largely avoided a situation where a few people walked off with the majority of the prized former state assets.Particularly in Poland, the transition led to a class of entrepreneurs like Grabski, rather than a small group of oligarchs. “We had the Solidarity movement in the factories and they were like a watchdog. So directors couldn’t go into shabby deals like in Russia,” says Balcerowicz.Fifteen years after the transition, Poland and seven other former communist east European countries joined the EU. With much of eastern Europe becoming part of the single market, it could be integrated into western European supply chains. For smaller businesses, it also meant operating in an improved institutional setting and convergence with EU standards. “Joining the EU was the key moment, not because of subsidies, but because of frameworks: anti-monopoly rules, environmental protection and so on,” says Grabski.In some countries in the region, these institutional frameworks are still under attack from governments, but the situation compared with neighbouring Ukraine, for example, where the courts, police and tax authorities are hopelessly dependent on political and big business interests, is incomparable.Life under capitalism was not rosy for everyone. At the vast Gdańsk shipyard, where Solidarity was born, the majority of orders came from the communist bloc and dried up after the transition.The shipyard was kept afloat with government subsidies, but these were deemed unfair according to EU competition laws. The shipyard was ided into several private enterprises, and little actual shipbuilding is still taking place. Many other communist-era factories across the region have gone the same way, unable to adapt to market conditions.But in place of the hulking shipyard, a number of smaller companies building yachts have sprung up in Gdańsk and elsewhere on Poland’s Baltic coast, and many of them have become successful.However, if there is one factory that symbolises both central Europe’s growth over the last three decades and the potential pitfalls going forward, it is not the Gdańsk shipyard but the Audi plant at Győr, in north-west Hungary.Audi first invested in the site in the early 1990s when it was a moribund heavy machinery factory for mainly communist bloc clients. Things took off when Hungary joined the EU in 2004 and could be integrated fully into the manufacturer’s supply chain. Today, Audi Hungaria is a modern-day capitalist version of a Soviet monogorod, or one-factory town. The vast complex on the outskirts of Győr is a set of nondescript white hangars linked by an internal road system, and the plant has its own restaurants, medical clinic, fire station and postal service.Every single Audi TT in the world is assembled here, while engines for many other models are also produced and shipped to Germany and elsewhere for assembly. In one vast hall, giant yellow Japanese robots whoosh and whir their way through the process of assembling the car bodies, cutting, welding, applying adhesives and piecing the cars together with minimal human input. Workers scurry between the halls, many with colour-coded polo-shirt collars denoting their status on the assembly line.The plant has over 13,000 employees, and when subcontractors and affiliated businesses are taken into account, it is estimated that between 25,000 and 30,000 people in Győr work in the automobile industry, which could amount to as much as half of the working-age population.While Poland is more ersified, by virtue of being the region’s biggest economy, for smaller countries in the region, the dependence on the German car market is huge, and some worry about the effects of a slump in the market on places like Győr. “If Volkswagen can’t sell to China, Slovakia gets hammered the next day,” says Piatkowski.Going forward, the key will be moving away from an economic model of western European countries outsourcing production to the east, and towards one that sees ideas and innovation developed inside the region. Only in this way, analysts say, will the countries of the region be able to fully close the gap in wealth and living standards with the other half of Europe. So far, however, there is little sign of the spending on research and development, or institutional reforms, that would be required for such a long-term shift.“Smart people across the region understand that the growth model is over, but whether real change is politically feasible is another question,” says Milan Nič, head of the central and eastern Europe programme at the German Council on Foreign Relations. “What I see is that businesses are looking for loopholes rather than changing the overall policies.”This kind of supply-chain relationship amplifies regional disgruntlement at being regarded a “second-tier” backwater by “old Europe”. Thirty years since the Velvet Revolution, some of those who helped bring down communism in 1989 are now supporters of populist governments who accrue political capital by attacking the EU.László Nagy, one of the organisers of the pan-European picnic in 1989, which presaged the fall of the Berlin Wall by allowing hundreds of East Germans to cross the Iron Curtain from Hungary to Austria and onwards to West Germany, complains that western Europe treats the new states like “the doormat of Europe”, with a condescending and patronising attitude.Additionally, while the statistics may show that on average even the poorest parts of society are better off than they were 30 years ago, this is little comfort to those in former industrial areas or rural regions where there is an overwhelming sense of decay indeed, that decay can feel ever more pressing when compared to the progress experienced in shinier areas.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous?

Jolanta Banach, a former Polish finance minister from a leftist party, puts much of the popularity of the country’s current populist government in smaller towns and villages down to the unequal access to public services and infrastructure: while big cities in Poland are now linked by modern fast trains, public transport in rural areas is often poor, an issue across the wider region too.Public health and education services are generally in better shape than 30 years ago, but also remain underfunded. “When you look at the Gini factor, it’s not so bad, but that hides a lot of things. What you don’t see in the statistics is the uneven access to public services and infrastructure,” says Banach.The introduction of freedom of movement with EU accession has also led to millions of central and eastern Europeans heading west over the past 15 years. On the one hand, this has provided opportunities and experiences that were unimaginable to the previous generation who were stuck behind the Iron Curtain, but it has also combined with declining birth rates and a fear of immigration to contribute to shrinking societies.In the three decades since independence, the populations of all the region’s countries have shrunk. Latvia has lost more than a quarter of its population, Bulgaria and Romania around a fifth. With higher salaries a short and easy flight away, the process was inevitable. In parts of the region, this has led to chronic shortages of doctors and other skilled workers.In the long run, if the countries of central and eastern Europe can continue to catch up with the west, many of the emigres will be drawn back. With Brexit stalking the UK, there are already anecdotal signs of an incipient return. There are flights from London and other western European hubs to dozens of cities in the region, often cheaply.“We haven’t lost these people,” says Piatkowski. “The form of emigration has changed. In the 19th century a redneck from the Polish mountains would move to America and you’d never hear of him for 100 years. Now you can get a €20 Ryanair flight back to Kraków.”As the economic gap between the east and the west of the continent continues to narrow, it is possible that many of these people will eventually return to their home countries, bringing with them money, skills and networks developed during their time abroad. Wałęsa, Solidarity’s leader and post-communist Poland’s first president, who was in charge when the shock therapy reforms were made, has become a marginal figure on the Polish political scene, and his cantankerous criticisms of the current government are sometimes seen as counterproductive even by the opposition. But he is still respected for his role in bringing the country out of communism.Reflecting on today’s economy, he thinks neoliberal economies require regulation to make sure they stay fair. “When there was a communist bloc, the two systems were keeping each other in check to some extent,” he says in an interview at his office in Gdańsk. “Now there is no control over the development of capitalism. It’s like a road without traffic lights or road signs.”However, looking back at the economic transition, famously compared by him and others to turning fish soup back into an aquarium, the 76-year-old feels there are plenty of reasons to look positively on the past three decades. “Already the fish are swimming, and they’re doing all right now,” he says, with a smile.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

More than 2,000 couples have since married, many of them taking part in Saturday’s festival.“I am very excited because it’s the first pride parade after same-sex marriages are recognised and I got married,” said Shane Lin, who became one of the first to marry his partner in the days after the new law was introduced.“I am very moved that people around the world are joining us,” he said.Behind him passed a steady stream of colour, including dancers, unicorn floats and rainbow balloon arches.“I support marriage equality because it is a basic human right,” Henry Wu, a heterosexual teacher who brought his five-year-old son to the march said.“Taiwan made huge progress in legalising same-sex marriages … I feel very proud we are the first in Asia to do so.”In the past decade Taiwan has become increasingly progressive on gay rights with Taipei home to a thriving LGBT community and increasingly large pride marches.Organisers estimated that at least 170,000 people attended Saturday’s festivities.The issue of same-sex equality has deeply polarised society. Taiwan’s constitutional court made a landmark ruling in 2017 to legalise gay marriage and ruled its decision should be implemented within two years.Conservative and religious groups mobilised to oppose amending the civil code and won a series of referendums last November in which voters rejected defining marriage as anything other than a union between a man and a woman.In May, conservative politicians put forward rival bills that offered something closer to limited same-sex unions but those measures ultimately failed in parliament.Opponents have vowed to punish the president, Tsai Ing-wen, and the politicians who supported the gay marriage law at the 11 January elections when voters would elect a new president and parliament.The election will be dominated by the relationship with China and local economic issues, but Tsai’s support of Taiwan’s gay marriage law – which still contains restrictions not faced by heterosexual couples – could harm her on the campaign trail, especially in more rural and conservative places.Same-sex couples could currently only adopt their partners’ biological children and could only marry foreigners from countries where gay marriage is also recognised.“Marriage equality is the beginning, it’s not the end,” said Leong Chin-fai, a Macanese national who is currently unable to marry his Taiwanese partner. “We hope to keep pushing for issues including recognition of international marriages, parental and adoption rights.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afc9d795838ab9c83d2028736c05fbf98191f2a5/0_144_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=264c70986497296e4827c5e32d720705","title":"tourism industry counts cost after separatist riots blight barcelona","story":"Catalonia has been counting the political cost after protests swept across the region following the decision by Spain’s supreme court to impose heavy sentences on Catalan separatist leaders found guilty of sedition. Now it faces a new cost – a slump in the lucrative tourist business in its hugely popular capital, Barcelona.The violent disturbances left the city with a clean-up bill estimated at €3m (£2.6m), but it is feared that the images of airport chaos, running battles with police and flaming barricades will cost a great deal more.Manel Casals, head of the Barcelona hoteliers association, said there had been cancellations and the number of bookings was down. The same is happening with Airbnb and similar platforms. According to AirDNA, a consultancy for the short-term rental sector, reservations for the week from 14 October were down by nearly 1,000 on a year earlier, at 11,537.Barcelona is also one of the world’s most popular conference venues. The biggest money-spinner is the Mobile World Conference. Last year the 100,000 visitors to the telecoms congress spent €473m while creating 14,000 temporary jobs. Its contract with the city expires in 2023.“Conferences are organised a long way in advance, and aside from an American convention I don’t know of any cancellations,” said Christoph Tessmar, director of the Barcelona tourism convention bureau. But he warned: “The images we’ve seen in recent days could have a negative impact in the short term.”Barcelona is also the cruise capital of the Mediterranean. At least three vessels carrying a total of 6,000 passengers opted not to dock in the city. According to the government, ports, railways and airports between them have lost around €4m. Altogether, about 175,000 travellers were affected by cancellations or delays caused by road blocks.For now, everyone is banking on Barcelona’s famed resilience. In 2017, when the city was rocked by both a terrorist attack and the illegal declaration of independence, thousands of businesses moved their headquarters out of Catalonia. However, the city bounced back.“These events can damage the city’s image but this conflict isn’t going to continue for ever and we’ll get back to normal,” said Gabriel Jené, president of Barcelona Oberta. “We’re more worried about the ability of politicians to deal with the conflict than the capacity of the city to overcome it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68dcc86807181d227c9fc5c9e4c755e13fe64e99/0_128_3286_1971/master/3286.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ab90727b3f247bfb86ba4128b673c80","title":"we must not turn our backs on children who seek sanctuary in the uk","story":"Offering safe and legal routes into Britain must be at heart of efforts to tackle traffickingThe plight of people who arrive in the UK in refrigerated lorries, or rubber dinghies, or between wheel caps, rarely makes the news. But last week, the discovery of 39 dead people in a container lorry in Essex was a story that made headlines across the world. While their inidual stories remain unknown, we can be certain that they have left behind families and friends, who even now may not know the fate of their loved ones.The deaths of these 39 victims lay bare the perilous dangers facing those who travel to the UK via dangerous routes. I do not know why these 39 people were in that lorry. I do not know if they had climbed inside hoping to reach a place of safety, in this country or elsewhere, or whether they were forced into that journey against their will.But I do know that many, many people hoping for sanctuary here undertake a similar route. With no safe and legal passage to the UK, they feel there is no other choice but to step into a refrigerated vehicle, let the door lock behind them and hope that they arrive safely at the other end.With some very limited exceptions, the only way a person can claim asylum here is if they are already on UK territory. Unless an inidual has the means to enter the UK on a visa and then make a claim, they are stuck. Smugglers and traffickers prey on people who have no hope, promising them safe passage in return for small fortunes. But it is the failure of the UK to offer a safe alternative that helps these smugglers to operate.Organisations such as Safe Passage work with unaccompanied children who have a legal right to resettle in the UK. The challenge is to persuade these young people to accept long delays of many months or longer rather than giving up hope and risking their lives on lorries or dinghies.The conditions in the Calais area and on the Greek islands are so appalling that it is easy for children to give up hope of a legal route to enable them to join their families in the UK. Smugglers are helped by the behaviour of the British and other governments and can offer what sounds like a quick route to a better life. The best way to deal with the smugglers is for the government to cut out the long delays and give these young people a quicker and legal route to safety.On Saturday, Refugee Rights Europe launched a report detailing the horrendous circumstances facing around 300 unaccompanied children in northern France, including exceptionally young children aged seven, nine and 12. According to the report, charities detail numerous accounts of women and girls being forced to perform sexual acts in exchange for a route to the UK. In 2018 more than 120 unaccompanied children went missing in this country after being trafficked from France.RRE’s report makes clear what those working with unaccompanied children know only too well: when a child does not have a safe route to the UK, they do not give up on their dream of safety. Instead they are forced into horrendous situations and potentially deadly journeys in their desperation to reach sanctuary.Even more tragically, if this government treated this situation with the urgency it so badly needs, many of these children would have been able to travel to the UK safely. Those with family in the UK are some of the few people that should be able to access a legal route to claim asylum, under the family reunion provisions of the EU Dublin III Regulation.But instead of doing everything it can to transfer these children and keep them out of the hands of smugglers, the Home Office often takes months if not years to decide whether to accept their claim.Worse, there have been no guarantees from the government that family reunion will continue regardless of what happens with Brexit. We are facing the closure of one of the few safe and legal routes to sanctuary that this country currently offers.The situation is bleaker still for the children that don’t have family ties to the UK. The “Dubs scheme” was established following an amendment I worked on with the support of MPs of all parties in 2016. We hoped it would offer legal routes to safety for up to 3,000 children, but it was capped by the government at 480 places. This scheme could represent a lifeline to children currently in France, Greece or elsewhere in Europe – if only the government could be persuaded to take action.I believe that people in the UK recognise that we cannot turn our backs on those seeking sanctuary. And I am convinced that offering safe and legal routes must be at the heart of any efforts to tackle the smuggling and trafficking that exploits those who are vulnerable and have no hope.This week, I joined the charity Safe Passage International to deliver a petition signed by 80,000 people, demanding that the home secretary keeps family reunion open for children in Europe, whatever happens with Brexit.The petition remains open and I hope it will continue to gather signatures, showing this government that people in Britain are ready to welcome child refugees. Safe Passage are also calling on the government to include unaccompanied child refugees from Europe in its new global resettlement scheme, due to begin next year.I urge the Home Office and the wider government to learn lessons from this week. I hope they will remember the horrendous deaths of 39 people in a container and many thousands of others who perish each year on dangerous journeys to the UK and across the world.And I hope this government will act now, to make sure unaccompanied children have a legal route to this country that saves them the same fate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22dc8101c893657c3c14d825f07a3db3fd963b55/0_80_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84fed23d4965a7ee781d8a368229991b","title":"its time to boycott any company doing business in xinjiang","story":"Forced labour in China’s internment camps taints the supply chains of many western companies. We need to take actionAny western company doing business in Xinjiang should consider their supply chains tainted by forced labour drawn from internment camps. Hardly a drop in the ocean of the vast global economy, this involves companies such as Ikea, H\u0026ampM, Volkswagen and Siemens.This month, the United States banned the import of products made by a firm in Xinjiang over its use of forced labour. It also blacklisted 28 Chinese entities for their role in the repression of Uighurs and issued visa restrictions on key Chinese officials. Following suit, two major Australian companies have now also announced they are ending partnership with their cotton supplier in Xinjiang.These are welcome steps but the United States and Australia are not the only countries with business interests in Xinjiang. It is time for a global blacklist on all goods produced or manufactured in Xinjiang.The UN committee on the elimination of racial discrimination has called Xinjiang a “no rights zone” amid the mass detention of several million ethnic and religious minorities.China claims they are mostly “vocational training centres.” But encircled by barbed wire, surveillance cameras, and armed guards, in reality many are labour camps where Uyghur, Kazakh, and other minorities are forced to work for little or no pay.And the concerns extend well beyond textiles and affect multiple supply chains. According to the Wall Street Journal, Adidas, Kraft Heinz, Coca-Cola, and Gap have or continue to source from Xinjiang. Volkswagen has had a manufacturing plant in Xinjiang since 2013, and in April 2019 its chief executive sparked condemnation when he claimed ignorance of China’s mass detention in Xinjiang.Xinjiang is also a major source of tomato paste for many leading international brands.But let’s return to the US ban, specifically on a company called Hetian Taida Apparel and Australian cotton imports.In late 2018, the Associated Press revealed North Carolina-based Badger Sportswear was sourcing from a Hetian Taida factory inside an internment camp in Xinjiang. After revelations of forced labour, many universities pulled Badger merchandise and in January the company announced it was ending the partnership. But how did a major American apparel distributor end up in bed with forced labour in China? A Workers Rights Consortium report found Badger failed to perform a labour rights assessment and actually concealed the factory as a supplier. The company chose profit over human rights, and they have not been alone.An Australian Broadcasting Corporation investigation this summer revealed six major retailers that sourced cotton from Xinjiang-based Litai Textiles and others. They included Australia’s largest global retailer, Cotton On Groups, Target Australia, and Swedish companies Ikea and H\u0026ampM. Even though Cotton on Group and Target Australia announced they would stop sourcing cotton from Xinjiang, it is a classic case of too little, too late.Further afield in other industries, German powerhouse Siemens shamefully maintains a technologies partnership with China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, a state-owned military contractor recently identified by Human Rights Watch as the firm behind a major surveillance tool contributing to mass detention in Xinjiang.The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights calls on businesses to prevent and mitigate the actual and potential human rights abuses associated with their business practices. Because of the potential for gross human rights abuses of doing business in Xinjiang, all foreign companies there should end their business partnerships.The only way forward is no more business as usual.Governments and organisations from Australia to the European Union should take immediate steps alongside the US to impose a global blacklist on the import of all goods produced or manufactured in Xinjiang. This must include import restrictions, forbidding companies from doing business in Xinjiang, and banning Xinjiang-based entities from accessing their markets.The global Magnitsky Act, for example, in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and a few other countries makes it easier to impose targeted financial and visa sanctions, which these governments should use against Chinese officials and corporate leaders responsible for abuses in Xinjiang.Foreign companies that have done business in Xinjiang must undergo a thorough and independent investigation to determine the extent to which they have benefited by forced labour or contributed to other gross human rights violations and face punitive measures, including financial penalties to contribute to material reparations for victims.Global consumers can also hold companies accountable and should demand an end to all business partnerships in Xinjiang or look to boycotting their products."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057998.1571674594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish times most nominated in newsbrands shortlist 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosita Boland with her trophy at the 2018 Newsbrands Ireland journalism awards Photograph: Simon CarswellThe  has received 32 nominations in the shortlist for the NewsBrands Journalism Awards 2019 – the highest number for a publication in this year’s competition.The NewsBrands Journalism Awards are open to any work published in print, website, online, mobile, video, audio or any other news delivery format from any NewsBrands Ireland member title.Five of the six journalists shortlisted in the Foreign Coverage category write for The : Sally Hayden Derek Scally Suzanne Lynch Lara Marlowe and Patrick Freyne.The  received four of the six nominations for Best Use of Video, citing the work of Simon Carswell, Kathleen Harris, Enda O’Dowd and Bryan O’Brien.Jack Power of The  was nominated in three categories Business Story of the Year Investigative Journalism and Young Journalist of the Year.  reporter Sarah Burns was also shortlisted as Young Journalist of the Year as was current  reporter Shauna Bowers for her past work at The Times, Ireland edition.Markets Correspondent Joe Brennan is shortlisted for Business Journalist of the Year.In the Campaigning Journalism category, The ’ No Child campaign has been shortlisted.Fintan O’Toole and Hilary Fannin are both nominated in the Broadsheet Columnist category, while in the Critic of the Year category The  has four writers shortlisted: Catherine Cleary Patrick Freyne Niamh Donnelly and Fintan O’Toole.Three  writers are shortlisted in the Features Broadsheet Writer of the Year: Rosita Boland, Conor Gallagher and Conor Pope.Carl O’Brien is nominated, along with Power, in the Investigative Journalism category.

At first we did not think much of it but when we got closer we realised It was a Patagonian one instead of the British. So, we immediately took it down. Then later I went to clean the toilets and saw the door was painted the same colour.”The Minquiers Management Committee, responsible for community affairs on the Island, were informed along with the Police and Receiver, who administers land owned by the Crown.Aerial view over the Minquiers, a group of islands and rocks in the English Channel, JerseyNews of the invasion was first reported by The Bailiwick Express. David Pett, Her Majesty’s Receiver General for Jersey, told the paper: “The Jersey Authorities are aware of the incident and the situation will be kept under close review appropriate action will be taken if there are any further incidents.”A spokesperson for the Government of Jersey added: “We understand that this is the latest in a series of practical jokes by well-known French author Jean Raspail, who has previously raised his ‘Patagonian’ flag on the islet. The Union Flag has since been raised again on The Minquiers.“While we believe there is no harmful intent by Mr Raspail, we are disappointed that he has painted the door of a hut that is used by visitors to the reef, and has allegedly washed paintbrushes on the rocks, which may disturb the ecology of the area. ”Despite only officially being the king of Patagonia for a matter of weeks, Orelie was credited by some for establishing a parliamentary monarchy and an advanced constitution for the indigenoious Mapuche people.The self-declared consul of the \u0026#34Kingdom of Patagonia\u0026#34 announced in Paris that his \u0026#34troops\u0026#34 had seized the deserted British rocks in the Channel August 30 1998His legacy has since been evoked by French romanticists who have raised the Patagonian flag on the largest of The Minquiers rocks in defiance of subsequent British claims to sovereignty of the territory.The latest attempt came in 1998 when a French light naval unit of the Patagonia Fleet replaced the British flag in order for it to be “honourably returned to her British Majesty’s embassy in Paris”.In a statement published at the time, the office of King Orelie-Antoine I’ said the “invasion” was in response to Britain’s “unacceptable and prolonged occupation of the Malouines (Falkland) Islands”.French fishermen arriving on the Minquiers and claiming the British occupied Channel islands as a property of FranceThey were protesting against the 1953 International Court of Justice ruling which unanimously ruled in favour of the British claim to sovereignty of the reef, although France also said it held historical rights.Even though the action was seen by many as a practical stunt, the British Embassy said they would recover the flag and replace it with the original British colours.The reef is now visited on a bi-annual basis by representatives of the Government of Jersey, the Parish, and by the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey to reaffirm the Island’s claim.The area continues to be protected by conservation treaty, the Ramsar Convention, due to its unique ecology.  Mind your language: Archbishop of Canterbury\u0026#39s Brexit warning for BorisMPs concerned over plans to combat people smuggling post-BrexitClocks go back: why do we use GMT - and do we still need to?Lord Kerslake\u0026#39s \u0026#39crossbench\u0026#39 status questioned as he takes the reins of McDonnell-backed think tankJohn Humphrys confessed to co-host Sarah Montague that he was earning five times as much as her before BBC pay gap was revealedStrictly Come Dancing 2019, Halloween week: injury-hit show sees Michelle Visage top scoreboard with near-perfect Addams Family foxtrotAsylum seeker who committed string of violent crimes will be deported after 15-year human rights battleGPs complain they are so rushed they don\u0026#39t have time to eat, drink and have to urinate in their consultation roomBritish Airways plane which filled with smoke has had two more \u0026#39fume incidents\u0026#39 - despite new engine Married men in Amazon  could become priests following landmark Vatican vote John Bercow in row over \u0026#39bullying stitch-up\u0026#39 as victims say new complaints system is \u0026#39too late\u0026#39\u0026#39Not enough time\u0026#39 to add 16-year-olds to electoral roll if snap election called, say officials Boris Johnson will target 40 marginal seats in General ElectionThe young female candidate at the heart of the Tories\u0026#39 battle to win Labour\u0026#39s heartlandPearson launches urgent review of  GCSE textbook after complaints that it \u0026#39whitewashed\u0026#39 Jewish historyHalf of men who claimed lover\u0026#39s death was sex game gone wrong get \u0026#39soft\u0026#39 sentenceComment: It would be a scandal for John Bercow to be awarded a peerageComment: Only the Conservatives can defeat Labour\u0026#39s \u0026#39dither and duplicity\u0026#39 on BrexitWhere were England\u0026#39s 2019 World Cup heroes in 2003?Medicinal cannabis prescriptions delayed for 10 weeks as patients miss out on pain relief in final daysComment: Hugely popular, pro-aspiration, and at a bargain price: the Tories should slash stamp dutyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/fashion/2019/09/10/TELEMMGLPICT000208231453_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqMLKzIIIZyEjH9VZmxgbjNoB3rUGp-RuzLPkdt5gt7Pc.jpeg?imwidth=","title":"emma weymouth completely devastated strictly come dancing voting","story":"Viscountess Emma Weymouth is completely devastated by a Strictly Come Dancing voting scandal inadvertently caused by a manager at her stately home, The  can reveal.

She said it took true grit to pull off a stunning Viennese Waltz that wowed the judges last week. And she hoped to put the furore behind her last night by dancing a fun murder mystery Charleston to Fergie’s A Little Party Never Killed Nobody.The mother-of-two, a businesswoman, chef, model and philanthropist, said she spent most of the week upside down mastering the tricks and flips for the Halowe\u0027en special.Born in London to a British mother and Nigerian father, Lady Emma became the chatelaine of the Longleat Estate following her marriage to Ceawlin Thynn, Viscount Weymouth, in 2013.Longleat Enterprises, which runs her family\u0027s 9,000-acre Wiltshire estate, said Mr Beasley\u0027s offer to staff was not officially sanctioned.He has since apologised and is also said to be devastated.Newsletter promotion - Ballroom Bulletin - in article (Strictly Come Dancing)Mind your language: Archbishop of Canterbury\u0026#39s Brexit warning for BorisMPs concerned over plans to combat people smuggling post-BrexitClocks go back: why do we use GMT - and do we still need to?Lord Kerslake\u0026#39s \u0026#39crossbench\u0026#39 status questioned as he takes the reins of McDonnell-backed think tankJohn Humphrys confessed to co-host Sarah Montague that he was earning five times as much as her before BBC pay gap was revealedStrictly Come Dancing 2019, Halloween week: injury-hit show sees Michelle Visage top scoreboard with near-perfect Addams Family foxtrotAsylum seeker who committed string of violent crimes will be deported after 15-year human rights battleGPs complain they are so rushed they don\u0026#39t have time to eat, drink and have to urinate in their consultation roomBritish Airways plane which filled with smoke has had two more \u0026#39fume incidents\u0026#39 - despite new engine Married men in Amazon  could become priests following landmark Vatican vote John Bercow in row over \u0026#39bullying stitch-up\u0026#39 as victims say new complaints system is \u0026#39too late\u0026#39\u0026#39Not enough time\u0026#39 to add 16-year-olds to electoral roll if snap election called, say officials Boris Johnson will target 40 marginal seats in General ElectionThe young female candidate at the heart of the Tories\u0026#39 battle to win Labour\u0026#39s heartlandPearson launches urgent review of  GCSE textbook after complaints that it \u0026#39whitewashed\u0026#39 Jewish historyWhere were England\u0026#39s 2019 World Cup heroes in 2003?Half of men who claimed lover\u0026#39s death was sex game gone wrong get \u0026#39soft\u0026#39 sentenceComment: It would be a scandal for John Bercow to be awarded a peerageComment: Only the Conservatives can defeat Labour\u0026#39s \u0026#39dither and duplicity\u0026#39 on BrexitMedicinal cannabis prescriptions delayed for 10 weeks as patients miss out on pain relief in final daysComment: Hugely popular, pro-aspiration, and at a bargain price: the Tories should slash stamp dutyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hugely popular pro aspiration bargain price tories should slash","story":"Stamp duty also has a huge social cost, stopping people from moving as much as they might want toThe looming election will of course be dominated by Brexit.

Responsible lending is much needed in these difficult times for the UK economy.”David Fisher, chief executive of Cash Euro Net’s parent company Enova International, blamed the FOS for QuickQuid’s collapse.“Over the past year and a half, we have experienced a challenging and uncertain regulatory environment in the UK, despite the fact that the FCA reviewed and approved our business practices and affordability criteria in 2015,” he said.“The FOS has continued to move the goalposts with its complaints handling decisions, in effect setting ever-changing de facto policies that in many instances was inconsistent with FCA guidelines.”People who have outstanding loans with QuickQuid are advised to continue making repayments as normal.“If you miss any repayments you could be hit by fees and additional charges, and it could also harm your credit rating,” said Caroline Siarkiewicz, acting chief executive at the Money and Pensions Service.“Eleven and a half million adults have less than £100 in savings and investments so lots of people face cash-flow problems which can make quick, short-term credit feel like the only option.\u0026nbsp“If you know you need a specific amount of money for a short while there may be more affordable alternatives out there, so it’s a good idea to shop around before you borrow.”The Money Advice Service website has a guide on alternatives to payday loans, and you can also contact a free helpline on 0800 138 7777Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The message was clear - without new financing WeWork would run out of money within weeks.“Do you still believe in the company?” Neumann, who had stepped down as chief executive but was still WeWork\u0027s chairman, asked a room of JPMorgan bankers on the 42nd floor of their midtown Manhattan headquarters on 6 October, the sources said.The JPMorgan bankers, led by asset and wealth management chief executive Mary Erdoes and debt capital markets head Jim Casey, told Neumann and other WeWork directors they would back the company, and were confident they could raise the money. But they would not underwrite the deal on the spot, as one board member requested.With questions swirling around WeWork\u0027s chances of survival in the wake of its failed IPO, the bankers told Neumann they needed some time to sound out investors first, according to the sources.Created with Sketch.Tech giants to be hit by new tax in France Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Amazon reported revenue of $232 billion worldwide in 2018Google\u0027s parent company reported revenue of $136 billion worldwide in 2018Apple reported revenue of $265 billion worldwide in 2018Facebook reported revenue of $55 billion worldwide in 2018Microsoft reported revenue of $110 billion worldwide in 2018Cisco reported revenue of $49 billion worldwide in 2018Criteo reported revenue of $2.3 billion worldwide in 2018Amazon reported revenue of $232 billion worldwide in 2018Google\u0027s parent company reported revenue of $136 billion worldwide in 2018Apple reported revenue of $265 billion worldwide in 2018Facebook reported revenue of $55 billion worldwide in 2018Microsoft reported revenue of $110 billion worldwide in 2018Cisco reported revenue of $49 billion worldwide in 2018Criteo reported revenue of $2.3 billion worldwide in 2018A few days later, an alternative rescue plan began to emerge from WeWork\u0027s largest shareholder, Japan\u0027s SoftBank.Both were far from perfect. But given its dire straits, WeWork was fortunate to have a choice.This account of how WeWork\u0027s financial rescue came together over the past three weeks is based on interviews with eight people with knowledge of the negotiations. They requested anonymity to discuss the confidential deliberations.WeWork, SoftBank and JPMorgan declined to comment for this story.Requests for an interview with Neumann were also declined.SoftBank offered $9.5bn\u0026nbspto WeWork, including new debt and recommitted equity, as well as a tender offer to partly cash out Neumann and other shareholders.In addition to providing more funds than JPMorgan, the SoftBank deal resolved what some WeWork directors privately referred to as the company\u0027s “corporate governance problem” - Neumann\u0027s controlling grip.SoftBank\u0027s deal would strip Neumann\u0027s voting power and remove him from the board. Neumann was blamed by other WeWork investors such as Benchmark Capital and China\u0027s Hony Capital, for the company\u0027s precipitous decline, some of the people said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHis erratic management style, combined with WeWork\u0027s lack of a clear path to profitability, alienated potential IPO investors.The problem was that Neumann could still wield power over the company even after he quit as chief executive\u0026nbspon 24 September because, as WeWork\u0027s founder, each of his shares had 10 voting rights. Others had only one vote for every share.WeWork staff outraged at former CEO’s payout while they face job cutsIt was clear to SoftBank, as well as to a special board committee formed to consider the financing plans, that Neumann relinquishing control would come with a price tag, three of the people said.In meetings in New York between Neumann and SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, the contours of a side deal came together. SoftBank would provide a $500 million credit line to refinance Neumann\u0027s personal borrowings made against WeWork\u0027s stock, as long as he used proceeds from cashing out up to $970m of his shares to repay SoftBank for that loan first.SoftBank\u0027s latest offer valued the company at as little as $5.9bn based on the repricing of warrants it was already committed to exercise, according to Bernstein research, a far cry from the $47 billion it had assigned to WeWork in January.Neumann\u0027s special pay-off did not stop there. He negotiated with SoftBank a four-year non-compete agreement with a $185 million “consulting fee” in return for stepping down from WeWork\u0027s board. He would now only get to observe board proceedings instead of participating.WeWork\u0027s special board committee members expressed concern that Neumann\u0027s bailout would cause outrage among many WeWork employees whose stock options had a much higher strike price than the valuation in SoftBank\u0027s tender offer, some of the people said.The committee declined to comment for this article.SoftBank\u0027s offer to buy up to $3bn of WeWork stock from employees and existing shareholders would value the company at about $8 billion, higher than the new valuation based on the warrants.Neumann attempted to push up the valuation of the tender offer in his negotiations with SoftBank, one of the people said.SoftBank stood firm. Anticipating criticism from its own shareholders for possibly throwing good money after bad, it wasn\u0027t prepared to pay more.Most WeWork directors wanted Neumann off the board, and many minority shareholders, which the special committee was formed to represent, wanted to cash out, the people said.Goldman Sachs profit hit by losses on investments in WeWork and UberWeWork\u0027s nosee is proof Adam Neumann can\u0027t walk on waterAs WeWork embraces big business, will it lose its cool?JPMorgan had not pursued raising additional money for shareholders, in part because WeWork only tasked the bank with delivering $5 billion of debt financing.When the bank submitted the debt package on Monday, only private equity firm Starwood Capital Group, run by real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht, had committed to join JPMorgan in sharing the financing burden.JPMorgan agreed to provide the rest and transfer the money by Thursday. But the deal also included a condition, known as a covenant, that would trigger a debt default if SoftBank did not make good on $1.5 billion that it had already committed to provide when warrants came due next April, the people said.JPMorgan wanted to ensure SoftBank would honour its financial commitment, which would lessen the risk for investors holding debt that would one day need to be repaid.But SoftBank told WeWork\u0027s board that it would not pay the $1.5bn if its financing offer was rejected, two of the people added.The problem from SoftBank\u0027s perspective was that those warrants were based on January\u0027s $47bn valuation of WeWork. It wanted to change the pricing radically to reflect WeWork\u0027s dramatic fall in value.JPMorgan dealmakers, on the other hand, believed WeWork\u0027s contract with SoftBank prevented the telecommunications and technology giant from reneging on that earlier commitment, other people familiar with the matter said.In the end, the risk that SoftBank wouldn\u0027t fulfill its commitment if the JPMorgan financing package was chosen helped swing the special committee\u0027s deliberations in favor of SoftBank\u0027s offer, they added.SoftBank had made WeWork an offer it had to accept.On Tuesday, SoftBank unveiled a deal that increased its ownership of WeWork to 80 per cent\u0026nbspfrom 30 per cent, but sought to avoid having to consolidate WeWork\u0027s liabilities on its balance sheet by not taking full control of the expanded board. SoftBank will only have 5 of the 10 seats.But unless SoftBank can turn WeWork around quickly, it could be a pyrrhic victory.WeWork has burned through almost $2.5bn\u0026nbspof cash since the end of June, and Claure will have to cut costs quickly, including slashing thousands of jobs and helping the company to find a way to get out of expensive leases. Otherwise, the new cash injection may not last long enough to stabilise the business.As predicted, Claure is also facing some staff anger over the size of Neumann\u0027s payout. He told employees on Wednesday that it was the “price” that had to be paid to get rid of Neumann\u0027s voting rights. Otherwise, he said, “Adam could do whatever he wanted.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself.

Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHKardashian was eliminated in the third week of the show’s seventh season. Her brother, Rob Kardashian, appeared on the show three years later.Ahead of the release of Jesus Is King, West was interviewed by Zane Lowe on Apple Music’s Beats 1,\u0026nbspand proclaimed that he is “unquestionably, undoubtedly, the greatest human artist of all time.He added: “It’s not even a question at this point.

By drilling those holes, the rover is able to analyse the material inside,\u0026nbspturning them into powder and dropping them into a portable lab it carries around inside its belly.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe picture also shows just how far the Curiosity rover has come.

The new experiment saw it use the nine of the cups that are intended for wet chemistry experiments, however, which can be used to look for the carbon-based molecules that form the building blocks of life.That data can then be sent back down to Earth to allow scientists to pick through them and learn about the ancient history of Mars – and whatever life might have called it home.Since there are so few of those cups, researchers only use them when they are sure the possible findings will be important enough. That meant that the rover undertook only the second ever of experiments last month, despite having been on the planet since 2012.We\u0027ve been eager to find an area that would be compelling enough to do wet chemistry, said SAM Principal Investigator Paul\u0026nbspMahaffy\u0026nbspof NASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight\u0026nbspCenter\u0026nbspin Greenbelt, Maryland.

Knowing his head was to be replaced with CGI, he covered his face in corpse paint and shrouded himself in a costume covered with Egyptian symbols and magical amulets, terrifying his co-stars in the process. Decades earlier, Cage had pulled out 12 of his own teeth in preparation for the lead role in Birdy (1984).Hilary Swank\u0027s exercise regime for drama Million Dollar Baby was so intense that it almost killed her. She spent so long in the gym (six days a week for three months) that a doctor told her a staph infection – caused by a burst blister on her foot – was hours away from reaching her heart.Such was the extent of Heath Ledger\u0027s commitment to the role of Joker in The Dark Knight (2008) that he ended up sleeping just two hours a night after locking himself away in a hotel room for an entire month to make a diary comprised of his villainous character\u0027s ramblings.Having lived an entire year in the life of late Doors frontman Jim Morrison, Val Kilmer had to go to therapy after struggling to get his life back on track. The actor had become so obsessed with the role that he ended up learning fifty of Morrison\u0027s songs and had everyone call him Jim on set of the 1991 biopic.Johnny Depp risked his life while preparing for the role of Hunter Thompson in Terry Gilliam\u0027s 1998 film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas he took hard drugs and spent his nights sleeping next to extremely dangerous containers of gunpowder and nitroglycerin.For war thriller Fury (2014), Shia LaBeouf slashed his own cheek and pulled a tooth out during filming. He also didn\u0027t wash for an entire month forcing the crew to arrange a separate room for him during night-time shoots.Rooney Mara completely changed her image to play the role of Lisbeth Salander in David Fincher\u0027s 2011 adaptation of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. She cut her hair, bleached her eyebrows and pierced her nipples to get into the mindset of the cyber hacker at the heart of Stieg Larrson\u0027s novels.Natalie Portman certainly worked for the Best Actress Oscar she received for 2010 film Black Swan. She shunned any suggestion of a body double for the film\u0027s extremely challenging dance scenes.In 2008, Joaquin Phoenix displayed some bizarre behaviour after\u0026nbsphe quit acting to become a hip-hop artist. It was later revealed that his life upheaval –\u0026nbspstrange interviews included – was, in fact, a giant hoax for mockumentary I\u0027m Still hereAfter hearing that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs had a diet comprised of just fruit, Ashton Kutcher thought he\u0027d do the same in preparation for his role in biopic Jobs (2013). He ended up hospitalised for severe vitamin deficiencies as well as a reduction in bone density.After begging Spike Lee to let her play the role of crack addict Vivian in his 1991 film Jungle Fever, Halle Berry proved her dedication to the role by refusing to bathe for two whole weeks.Meryl Streep has recounted the time Dustin Hoffman slapped her on their first take filming 1979 orce drama Kramer vs Kramer, something everyone can agree was an unacceptable step too far.Known to be one of the biggest method actors around, Daniel Day-Lewis spent six months alone in the wilderness in preparation for his role in The Last of the Mohicans (1992).Anne Hathaway may have won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Les Misérables (2012), but the role of Fantine – which saw her cut off her hair and eat nothing but lettuce and oatmeal paste – left her in a state of deprivation, both physically and emotionally.Christian Bale has since vowed not to mess with his weight again following his Oscar win for Vice earlier this year but, back in 2004, he lost such an alarming amount of weight for the role of Trevor Reznik in The Machinist that he became virtually unrecognisable. I was intrigued by a perverse nature of mine just to see if I can go beyond what I\u0027ve been told is actually safe and okay, and see if I could push the limits, he went on to tell the BBC.While many would expect to see Charlize Theron here for her Oscar-winning turn as Aileen Wuornos in Monster, it\u0027s her role in spy film Atomic Blonde (2017) that saw her take things too far. Theron was so adamant she perform her own stunts that she bruised her ribs and clenched her teeth so hard she broke two of them. The entire cast of 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u0027s Nest stayed in a real mental asylum to prepare for the film. DeVito went so far as to dream up an imaginary friend, one he became convinced was real.To get into the lead role of Oscar-winning film The Pianist (2002), Adrien Brody upheaved his life so much that it took him over a year and a half to get things back on track not only did he starve himself to a staggering degree, but sold his home and broke up with his long-term girlfriend.   The Oscar-winner got so into his role of Joker in 2016\u0027s Suicide Squad that he sent his co-stars, including Margot Robbie and Will Smith, stray bullets and used condoms in the post. He event circulated a video of himself with nothing but a dead pig for company to the entire crew.Kate Winslet took her role of the former Nazi concentration camp guard at the heart of drama The Reader (2008) so seriously that she spoke with a German accent while at home with her family. She compared leaving the character behind her to escaping a serious car crash.For Taxi Driver, most actors wouldn\u0027t have  got themselves a fake license and cruised around New York City throughout the night to get into the role of the deranged Travis Bickle, but that\u0027s precisely what Robert De Niro ended up doing in 1976.Nicolas Cage has a history of taking his roles too far, but the peak arrived with the Ghost Rider sequel, Spirit of Vengeance (2011).

It coincided with the publication of Lord Bew\u0027s review and an announcement of extra funding for Scottish farmersQuickQuid customers who believe they may be owed compensation can contact the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) to make a complaint.However, the Ombudsman said:\u0026nbspWe will be working with the administrators of the company to understand what that means for consumers, but it is unlikely that we will be able to progress any existing complaints about CashEuroNet any further, or look at any new complaints about it.Once we have clarity on this from the administrators of the firm, we will be writing to people who currently have cases against CashEuroNet with us to advise them on what they should do.CashEuroNet is the UK’s most complained-about payday lender with 10,409 disputes lodged with the FOS last year.Almost two-thirds of those were upheld, leaving the firm with a hefty bill to redress customers. The company received a further 3,000 complaints in the first half of this year.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Responsible lending is much needed in these difficult times for the UK economy.”David Fisher, chief executive of Cash Euro Net’s parent company Enova International, blamed the FOS for QuickQuid’s collapse.“Over the past year and a half, we have experienced a challenging and uncertain regulatory environment in the UK, despite the fact that the FCA reviewed and approved our business practices and affordability criteria in 2015,” he said.“The FOS has continued to move the goalposts with its complaints handling decisions, in effect setting ever-changing de facto policies that in many instances was inconsistent with FCA guidelines.”People who have outstanding loans with QuickQuid are advised to continue making repayments as normal.“If you miss any repayments you could be hit by fees and additional charges, and it could also harm your credit rating,” said Caroline Siarkiewicz, acting chief executive at the Money and Pensions Service.“Eleven and a half million adults have less than £100 in savings and investments so lots of people face cash-flow problems which can make quick, short-term credit feel like the only option.\u0026nbsp“If you know you need a specific amount of money for a short while there may be more affordable alternatives out there, so it’s a good idea to shop around before you borrow.”The Money Advice Service website has a guide on alternatives to payday loans, and you can also contact a free helpline on 0800 138 7777Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Nun.\u0026nbspThese are just a few of the\u0026nbsphorror films\u0026nbspwhose production was allegedly plagued with strange occurrences.These accounts from cast, directors and crew members – which include incidents that occurred after the film\u0027s release – may have no truth to them, but\u0026nbspsomething odd is afoot with a lot of the cases.From mysterious on-set fires to tragic deaths\u0026nbspand terrifying cases of suspected paranormal activity, we\u0027ve compiled 17 examples of films that were supposedly hit by curses.Scroll through the below gallery to see them for yourself.Created with Sketch.17 scary films that were supposedly cursed Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Rosemary\u0027s Baby producer William Castle was convinced Roman Polanski\u0027s 1968 chiller was cursed. After its release, he was hospitalised with kidney stones and, after experiencing hallucinations during his near-death experience, claimed to have seen the film\u0027s lead character approaching him with a knife. The Exorcist star Ellen Burstyn detailed a terrifying incident in which a fire burned the majority of the 1973 horror film\u0027s set to the ground. Despite it destroying the interiors depicting the MacNeil family\u0027s home, it somehow left the bedroom of the possessed Regan (Linda Blair) inexplicably untouched.The Omen was plagued by a lot of terrible incidents:  James Brolin claimed it was a ghostly presence that pushed him into appearing in The Amityville Horror he was thinking about the role when an item of clothing fell off a hanger in his bedroom, startling him. Ryan Reynolds, the lead star of the 2005 remake, would later claim to have woken up at 3.15am – otherwise known as the witching hour – every morning without rhyme or reason.Child star Oliver Robbins claimed he nearly died after being choked by the arms of the evil puppet featured in 1982 film Poltergeist. A few years after the film was released, young actor Heather O\u0027Rourke died from cardiac arrest and septic shock caused by a misdiagnosed intestinal stenosis. She was 12.Tragedy hit the Twilight Zone movie when director John Landis – who fell out with co-director Steven Spielberg due to unsafely cutting too many corners during production –\u0026nbsppushed ahead with a stunt despite windy conditions. When a helicopter flew out of control, it came crashing down right onto the precise position where actor Vic Morrow and two child stars, Myca Dinh Le, seven, and Renee Shin-Yi Chen, six, were killed by the whirring blades and falling debris. The incident, which saw Landis acquitted of manslaughter charges, led to greater regulations in on-set safety.You always felt like someone was going to die on this set, actor Laura Harrington said about Stephen King\u0027s Maximum Overdrive. The cursed film saw near-death experiences for cameramen and stuntmen as well as a hurricane, which hit the set during production.

The Exorcist star Ellen Burstyn detailed a terrifying incident in which a fire burned the majority of the 1973 horror film\u0027s set to the ground. Despite it destroying the interiors depicting the MacNeil family\u0027s home, it somehow left the bedroom of the possessed Regan (Linda Blair) inexplicably untouched.The Omen was plagued by a lot of terrible incidents:  James Brolin claimed it was a ghostly presence that pushed him into appearing in The Amityville Horror he was thinking about the role when an item of clothing fell off a hanger in his bedroom, startling him. Ryan Reynolds, the lead star of the 2005 remake, would later claim to have woken up at 3.15am – otherwise known as the witching hour – every morning without rhyme or reason.Child star Oliver Robbins claimed he nearly died after being choked by the arms of the evil puppet featured in 1982 film Poltergeist. A few years after the film was released, young actor Heather O\u0027Rourke died from cardiac arrest and septic shock caused by a misdiagnosed intestinal stenosis. She was 12.Tragedy hit the Twilight Zone movie when director John Landis – who fell out with co-director Steven Spielberg due to unsafely cutting too many corners during production –\u0026nbsppushed ahead with a stunt despite windy conditions. When a helicopter flew out of control, it came crashing down right onto the precise position where actor Vic Morrow and two child stars, Myca Dinh Le, seven, and Renee Shin-Yi Chen, six, were killed by the whirring blades and falling debris. The incident, which saw Landis acquitted of manslaughter charges, led to greater regulations in on-set safety.You always felt like someone was going to die on this set, actor Laura Harrington said about Stephen King\u0027s Maximum Overdrive.

Digital photogrammetry being used to record 3D images of the micro-topography on the tops of the lintels at Stonehenge. “Our investigation will tell us much about Bronze Age metalworking technology, how the bronze artefacts were used – and their potential role in the belief systems of that time,” said archaeologist\u0026nbspAndy Peachey, a prehistorian from Archaeological Solutions, the specialist unit which carried out the excavation.It’s the largest ever Bronze Age hoard to be discovered in London, and one of the three largest ever found in the UK.Mystery of ‘extraordinary’ haul of Bronze Age weapons baffles expertsBronze Age saw flourishing drug trade, opium in ancient vase revealsArchaeologists discover long-lost tools used to build StonehengeThe site, near Rainham in the London Borough of Havering, directly overlooks what would have been a large area of of frequently flooded Thames-side marshland.The find is particularly significant because of the known ancient tradition of worshipping rivers as sacred. That tradition was strong throughout much of Britain and continental Europe, and parts of western and southern Asia.On the whole, with relatively few exceptions, river deities tended to be female.There are literally thousands of rivers in Europe and Asia associated with known and named ancient deities – including Sequana (the Seine), Sionann (the Shannon), Verbeia (the Wharf), Durius (the Douro in Portugal), Alpheus (River Alfeios in Greece), Tiberinus (the Tiber in Italy), and Ganga (the Ganges in India).Sequana – the goddess of the River SeineIn dozens of cases the mythological narrative, revealing a river’s ine status, has survived across the millennia.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In aggregate, the artefacts weighed 45 kilos and represented around 300 originally complete objects.The excavation also revealed three other pits – containing hundreds of fragments of broken pottery (potentially general refuse – or even the debris from small-scale ceremonial feasting).Significantly, two other hoards of metalwork are known from the area, discovered just a few miles away back in the 1950s and the 1960s.The precise location and nature of the site itself (at the end of a promontory and immediately adjacent to and facing directly onto one of the Thames Valley’s largest wetlands) suggests a potential ritual or ceremonial function, rather than a purely commercial one.Intriguingly, the circular building’s entranceway faces north, which is not the norm for ordinary residential roundhouses.19th-century Indian artist Raja Ravi Varma portrays the goddess Ganga descending from heaven to form the River Ganges on EarthHowever, in most other cases of marshland-related metalwork deposits, the prehistoric rituals involved placing bronze artefacts in (or throwing them into) rivers and swamps, rather than merely burying them immediately adjacent to a wetland.Although a prehistoric commercial function cannot be completely ruled out, it is conceivable that the artefacts may have been held in storage within the complex, awaiting eventual ritual deposition in the adjacent swamp. Indeed, it is possible that burying it within a sacred enclosure would have been seen as giving the items sacred status, if the intention was to later deposit them in the adjacent marsh.However, the bronzes were all deposited in the pits at virtually the same time – but at the very end of the lifetime of the complex. It is therefore also possible that they were interred as an act of ritual closure – marking the sanctified decommissioning of this probably sacred site overlooking the Thames-side marshes.If indeed the complex was a ritual or ceremonial centre involved in the veneration of water spirits – or of a river deity –\u0026nbspit will raise the question as to the potential identity of a prehistoric Thames god or goddess.Although there are at least half a dozen Roman and Romano Celtic temples (all dating from at least 900 years after the Rainham complex), none of them give any clue as to what the name of such an ancient Thames deity might have been.Since at least the 18th century, Old Father Thames has been a popular literary and artistic motif – but he is probably a romantic early modern invention.18th century sculpture of Old Father Thames – but the river’s real ancient deity was probably a goddess (Juan Gutiérrez Andrés (CC BY-SA 3.0))Any truly ancient Thames deity would almost certainly have been female (like other British, Irish and French examples).Certainly, votive offerings have been deposited in the Thames for the past 5,500 years. The oldest known name for London’s river is the Tamessa (Tamesis in Latin).Bronze Age Britons lived with 1m-long worms in their kidneysHowever, that name was almost certainly originally pre-Celtic – and potentially even pre-Indo-European. It seems to be linked with an Old European word meaning ‘to flow’.So it can potentially just be translated as “the flowing one”\u0026nbsp– ie\u0026nbspsimply “The River”. Sadly, its more specific original name (if it ever had one) is lost, submerged at some point far back in the stream of time.Commenting on the discovery of the Rainham Bronze Age metalwork, Roy Stephenson, historic environment lead\u0026nbspat the Museum of London, said: “It’s incredibly rare to have uncovered a hoard of this size on one site”.Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: “This extraordinary discovery adds immensely to our understanding of Bronze Age life.”The bronzes will go on display for the first time as the focal point of a major exhibition at the Museum of London Docklands in April 2020.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Many more, he simply approached them in communal areas over cafe breakfasts, perhaps, or pints and pool tables.He always had the same question: can I take your picture?“People looked at me like I was a lunatic,” he says today. “Like ‘What do you want photos of this s***hole for?’ But I don’t know. To me, these places are beautiful, they need documenting. The people here, they get forgotten by those in power and by gentrification. But the community, it is still strong.”The results of his unusual mission is a collection of photos entitled Utopia London Council Estates, exclusively showcased\u0026nbspin The Independent.They capture the people and the built environment of everywhere from Robin Hood Gardens in Poplar to Thamesmead in Bexley, from the now demolished Heygate\u0026nbspestate\u0026nbspin Walworth, to tragic Grenfell Tower in Kensington.“As a kid growing up in Turin I was fascinated by the culture that came from the English working classes, especially bands like Oasis and The Stone Roses,” says the 31-year-old, who moved on to Rome earlier this year. “So when I came here in 2011, I suppose I gravitated towards those sort of places. That’s where I liked to have a drink, have a pork pie. I like the people there. They talk to you. They don’t have agendas.”Bethnal Green, 2019 part of Utopia London Council Estates photo collection by Marco Sconocchia (Marco Sconocchia)He decided to start taking pictures around 2013 and, while working as a professional photographer on various publications, continued this personal project for five years in his spare time.Among his images are kids playing on bikes, residents in their flats, police attending incidents and at least one full breakfast with chips.Despite some of the places he visited having a reputation for crime, he says he never once felt intimidated.“I know there is that stigma but I think this, it is exaggerated,” he says. “I never had any issues even carrying around cameras.

The message was clear - without new financing WeWork would run out of money within weeks.“Do you still believe in the company?” Neumann, who had stepped down as chief executive but was still WeWork\u0027s chairman, asked a room of JPMorgan bankers on the 42nd floor of their midtown Manhattan headquarters on 6 October, the sources said.The JPMorgan bankers, led by asset and wealth management chief executive Mary Erdoes and debt capital markets head Jim Casey, told Neumann and other WeWork directors they would back the company, and were confident they could raise the money. But they would not underwrite the deal on the spot, as one board member requested.With questions swirling around WeWork\u0027s chances of survival in the wake of its failed IPO, the bankers told Neumann they needed some time to sound out investors first, according to the sources.Created with Sketch.Tech giants to be hit by new tax in France Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Amazon reported revenue of $232 billion worldwide in 2018Google\u0027s parent company reported revenue of $136 billion worldwide in 2018Apple reported revenue of $265 billion worldwide in 2018Facebook reported revenue of $55 billion worldwide in 2018Microsoft reported revenue of $110 billion worldwide in 2018Cisco reported revenue of $49 billion worldwide in 2018Criteo reported revenue of $2.3 billion worldwide in 2018Amazon reported revenue of $232 billion worldwide in 2018Google\u0027s parent company reported revenue of $136 billion worldwide in 2018Apple reported revenue of $265 billion worldwide in 2018Facebook reported revenue of $55 billion worldwide in 2018Microsoft reported revenue of $110 billion worldwide in 2018Cisco reported revenue of $49 billion worldwide in 2018Criteo reported revenue of $2.3 billion worldwide in 2018A few days later, an alternative rescue plan began to emerge from WeWork\u0027s largest shareholder, Japan\u0027s SoftBank.Both were far from perfect. But given its dire straits, WeWork was fortunate to have a choice.This account of how WeWork\u0027s financial rescue came together over the past three weeks is based on interviews with eight people with knowledge of the negotiations. They requested anonymity to discuss the confidential deliberations.WeWork, SoftBank and JPMorgan declined to comment for this story.Requests for an interview with Neumann were also declined.SoftBank offered $9.5bn\u0026nbspto WeWork, including new debt and recommitted equity, as well as a tender offer to partly cash out Neumann and other shareholders.In addition to providing more funds than JPMorgan, the SoftBank deal resolved what some WeWork directors privately referred to as the company\u0027s “corporate governance problem” - Neumann\u0027s controlling grip.SoftBank\u0027s deal would strip Neumann\u0027s voting power and remove him from the board. Neumann was blamed by other WeWork investors such as Benchmark Capital and China\u0027s Hony Capital, for the company\u0027s precipitous decline, some of the people said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHis erratic management style, combined with WeWork\u0027s lack of a clear path to profitability, alienated potential IPO investors.The problem was that Neumann could still wield power over the company even after he quit as chief executive\u0026nbspon 24 September because, as WeWork\u0027s founder, each of his shares had 10 voting rights. Others had only one vote for every share.WeWork staff outraged at former CEO’s payout while they face job cutsIt was clear to SoftBank, as well as to a special board committee formed to consider the financing plans, that Neumann relinquishing control would come with a price tag, three of the people said.In meetings in New York between Neumann and SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, the contours of a side deal came together. SoftBank would provide a $500 million credit line to refinance Neumann\u0027s personal borrowings made against WeWork\u0027s stock, as long as he used proceeds from cashing out up to $970m of his shares to repay SoftBank for that loan first.SoftBank\u0027s latest offer valued the company at as little as $5.9bn based on the repricing of warrants it was already committed to exercise, according to Bernstein research, a far cry from the $47 billion it had assigned to WeWork in January.Neumann\u0027s special pay-off did not stop there. He negotiated with SoftBank a four-year non-compete agreement with a $185 million “consulting fee” in return for stepping down from WeWork\u0027s board. He would now only get to observe board proceedings instead of participating.WeWork\u0027s special board committee members expressed concern that Neumann\u0027s bailout would cause outrage among many WeWork employees whose stock options had a much higher strike price than the valuation in SoftBank\u0027s tender offer, some of the people said.The committee declined to comment for this article.SoftBank\u0027s offer to buy up to $3bn of WeWork stock from employees and existing shareholders would value the company at about $8 billion, higher than the new valuation based on the warrants.Neumann attempted to push up the valuation of the tender offer in his negotiations with SoftBank, one of the people said.SoftBank stood firm. Anticipating criticism from its own shareholders for possibly throwing good money after bad, it wasn\u0027t prepared to pay more.Most WeWork directors wanted Neumann off the board, and many minority shareholders, which the special committee was formed to represent, wanted to cash out, the people said.Goldman Sachs profit hit by losses on investments in WeWork and UberWeWork\u0027s nosee is proof Adam Neumann can\u0027t walk on waterAs WeWork embraces big business, will it lose its cool?JPMorgan had not pursued raising additional money for shareholders, in part because WeWork only tasked the bank with delivering $5 billion of debt financing.When the bank submitted the debt package on Monday, only private equity firm Starwood Capital Group, run by real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht, had committed to join JPMorgan in sharing the financing burden.JPMorgan agreed to provide the rest and transfer the money by Thursday. But the deal also included a condition, known as a covenant, that would trigger a debt default if SoftBank did not make good on $1.5 billion that it had already committed to provide when warrants came due next April, the people said.JPMorgan wanted to ensure SoftBank would honour its financial commitment, which would lessen the risk for investors holding debt that would one day need to be repaid.But SoftBank told WeWork\u0027s board that it would not pay the $1.5bn if its financing offer was rejected, two of the people added.The problem from SoftBank\u0027s perspective was that those warrants were based on January\u0027s $47bn valuation of WeWork. It wanted to change the pricing radically to reflect WeWork\u0027s dramatic fall in value.JPMorgan dealmakers, on the other hand, believed WeWork\u0027s contract with SoftBank prevented the telecommunications and technology giant from reneging on that earlier commitment, other people familiar with the matter said.In the end, the risk that SoftBank wouldn\u0027t fulfill its commitment if the JPMorgan financing package was chosen helped swing the special committee\u0027s deliberations in favor of SoftBank\u0027s offer, they added.SoftBank had made WeWork an offer it had to accept.On Tuesday, SoftBank unveiled a deal that increased its ownership of WeWork to 80 per cent\u0026nbspfrom 30 per cent, but sought to avoid having to consolidate WeWork\u0027s liabilities on its balance sheet by not taking full control of the expanded board. SoftBank will only have 5 of the 10 seats.But unless SoftBank can turn WeWork around quickly, it could be a pyrrhic victory.WeWork has burned through almost $2.5bn\u0026nbspof cash since the end of June, and Claure will have to cut costs quickly, including slashing thousands of jobs and helping the company to find a way to get out of expensive leases. Otherwise, the new cash injection may not last long enough to stabilise the business.As predicted, Claure is also facing some staff anger over the size of Neumann\u0027s payout. He told employees on Wednesday that it was the “price” that had to be paid to get rid of Neumann\u0027s voting rights. Otherwise, he said, “Adam could do whatever he wanted.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Despite occupying such an important place in science fiction, as well as being the subject of feverish research by scientists, they are yet to be confirmed.But if they do exist, astronomers have proposed a way that we might be able to see them.Researchers hope that they might be able to spot a wormhole around the supermassive black hole at the middle of our Milky Way galaxy, which is known as Sagittarius A*. There is no specific reason to think the black hole has one – but researchers think that the extreme and turbulent gravitational conditions of a supermassive black hole should be a good place to find one.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberIf there is one lurking at the heart of our galaxy, the stars in our galaxy should be influenced by the gravity of stars at the other end of the wormhole, the researchers suggest. That should make it possible to see one, if indirectly, by looking for the slight deviations in the orbits of the nearby stars.Supermassive black hole exploded in Milky Way, scientists findIf you have two stars, one on each side of the wormhole, the star on our side should feel the gravitational influence of the star that\u0027s on the other side. The gravitational flux will go through the wormhole, said\u0026nbspDejan Stojkovic, cosmologist and professor of physics in the University at Buffalo College of Arts and Sciences. So if you map the expected orbit of a star around Sagittarius A*, you should see deviations from that orbit if there is a wormhole there with a star on the other side.Sadly, even if there is a wormhole relatively nearby it will not be possible to travel through it and find yourself elsewhere in the universe, scientists say.Even if a wormhole is traversable, people and spaceships most likely aren\u0027t going to be passing through, said Dr Stojkovic. Realistically, you would need a source of negative energy to keep the wormhole open, and we don\u0027t know how to do that. To create a huge wormhole that\u0027s stable, you need some magic.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Meghan is struggling with le as a new motherand the global attention that comes with joining the “The Firm”. And Harry wants to protect her.But their latest complaints seemed poorly timed and worryingly self-indulgent. How  can you describe the royal couple seeing impoverished young African girls learning to box so they can fight off sexual predators, then using air time to address their First World problems with the media The same media, I might add, that was praising Meghan’s obvious intelligence and charm and had hitherto featured glowing reports from their first official overseas tour together.Prince William is reportedly “worried” about his brother’s state of mind, and after watching the documentary Harry  Meghan: An African Journey, one could only agree and conclude that we’re seeing a man teetering on the edge.The rampant paranoia, the relentless victim narrative and a tendency towards the dramatic are all perhaps signs that Harry does indeed need to take a break from public le before he unravels even further.But during that respite, he must surely seek specialist help and ask himself this: Is his obvious angst really just down to the media occasionally writing inconvenient truths about his we’s fractured family and questioning the couple’s obvious hypocrisy at using private jets while preaching about climate change OR is it the result of unresolved issues surrounding his mother Diana’s untimely death  My money’s on the latter, not least because Harry’s escalating rhetoric around the “safety of my family” rang alarm bells with me.As a child, my husband witnessed the accidental death of his -month- old brother and was put in the ambulance with his screaming mother. When he was , his -year- old father died suddenly at home during an afternoon nap.Both were deeply traumatic events that, by the time we met in , he thought he’d dealt with. But, in late , the birth of our daughter triggered a delayed response and he became riven with anxiety that something might happen to her.He developed the now resolved habit of what psychiatrist’s might refer to as “catastrophising” where, in his mind, a cut finger would escalate to potential sepsis and, like  Harry, “the safety of my ­family”  was an oft repeated mantra to try to  quash rational debate.Put simply, he felt a loss of ­control over what happened to his brother and father, which then manested itself in a disproportionately dramatic reaction to even the simplest of le’s problems and an inability to see past them.So I can only wonder whether the birth of his son Archie has triggered the same powerful reaction in Harry, who admits he thought he was out of the woods with his mental health, “but suddenly it all came back.” It would certainly explain his tears at the recent WellChild Awards, where his speech centred on his and Meghan’s feelings since having achild rather than focusing on the stories of those being celebrated.And it was “the safety of my family” he used to explain the use of private jets when, just a few days later, William and Kate — the future King and Queen of Britain — quietly boarded a commercial flight to Scotland with their kids and the dference in attitudes was there for all to see.Both William and Harry suffered the untimely loss of their mother and — wrongly, to my mind — faced the intolerable pressure of having to walk behind her coffin while the world looked on.BUT as William has clearly learned toaround the trauma and get on with his le in a mature and rational way, Harry still seems troubled, angry and prone to irrational outbursts.“I will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum,” he declared to interviewer and friend Tom Bradby.The tragic sequence of events that led to the death of his mother were going to the Paris Ritz with an international playboy, deciding to leave the safety of their hotel suite at midnight when they knew there were motorbike paps outside, unwittingly getting into a car driven by someone well over the drink-drive limit and not wearing a seatbelt.So yes, the paparazzi followed the carand, in an ideal world, they wouldn’t have.But a French inquiry cleared the bikes of involvement in the crash and, in the real world, anyone famous knows thatyou don’t want to be “papped” you live your le accordingly by maintaining a low profile and avoiding celebrity hang-outs.The Cambridges know that ­living a quiet, unremarkable le is the greatest antidote to unwanted media attention but also accept that the trade-off for the privilege le of being royal is that, ­occasionally, there will be “off message” stories and opinions they don’t like.On the South Africa tour, tetchy Prince Harry behaved like an entitled elite when he chastised Sky’s invited royal correspondent Rhiannon Mills for asking him a perfectly anodyne question about his visit.Later, while reporting from William and Kate’s hugely successful tour of Pakistan, Rhiannon praised the Cambridges for their regular and friendly interactions with the media.She observes that they clearly understand that official duty for Queen and country come first.“Compare it with the tone of the end of Prince Harry and Meghan’s tour a few weeks ago and you couldn’t have a bigger contrast,” she adds. “Harry had made it all about them by releasing a statement announcing legal action against The Mail on Sunday and criticising the Press.”EQUALLY, it’s worth noting that, like Meghan, Kate also had to adapt to royal le and, despite being mum to three young children, has never publicly complained about her lot.Probably because she understands that there are millions of people in the country with far worse problems and without the support network or finances to cushion the blow.That’s a rational outlook but, right now, Harry is clearly locked in a victim narrative where the nasty Press hunted his mother to her death and even the mildest criticism of him or his we is taken as “bullying” behaviour that threatens their very existence.I feel sympathy for him, but only he can change that self-pitying narrative, with his we’s support. Unfortunately, unlike Kate, Meghan doesn’t have a close-knit family around her and, judging by what she said in the same ­documentary, may be enabling rather than ­calming his paranoia.She said her British friends had warned her off marrying Harry because “the British tabloids will destroy your le.” Really  Or did they rightly just advise that the Press attention would be several notches higher than she’d been used to  Particularly as she has a rather off- message family Certainly not the poor man at Wimbledon who got ticked off by “Meghan’s ­people” for trying to take a photo of her when he was actually taking a selfie.No, it’s definitely time for a ­period of rest and, ­hopefully, reflection.  And , at the end of it, they decide to step away from royal le and live as private citizens, then we wish them nothing but the best.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That is totally understandable. But there is a risk to attempting it before delivering Brexit as he promised.There is a danger too, of course, that Remainers will kill his deal in the next fortnight via fatal amendments. Most Labour “moderates” in Leave seats cannot be trusted to back it, however much they hope to pull the wool over their constituents’ eyes.But the PM can then go to the polls promising that a Tory majority will reverse their tricks and finalise his deal.As it stands, Labour must agree to any election. And it is truly jaw-dropping to watch them running away, having screamed for so long for the chance to replace the dastardly Tories.With their ratings in freefall and in mortal fear of Boris’s popularity, they concoct ever more ludicrous excuses to dodge a reckoning. It is shredding the last remnants of their credibility.The public wants an election, by  per cent to .

It would be far more eco-friendly than burning coal.But the Tories lost the PR war against a green social media campaign which terried the public using debunked and out-of-date US scare stories.

Instead it buckled and hit fracking firms with regulations making exploration all but impossible.What a calamitous missed opportunity.IT is impossible to imagine the terrying ordeal of the  migrants who died in a refrigerated truck.And we recoil at the evil and greed of the traffickers who have profited from this appalling tragedy.The only comfort is that there is every chance, from the details already known, that they will be brought to justice.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Johnson admitted the EU was inclined to offer an extension to the end of January and that Emmanuel Macron was fighting a lonely battle against it.Earlier in the day, the Elysée told No the French President was too isolated on the issue to veto a longer extension.In a sign of how much he is relying on Macron, Johnson then pleadingly recited the opening line of the carol “Oh come, oh come Emmanuel” to ministers.One of No’s hopes is that EU leaders will see the Opposition refusing both a general election and to pass the withdrawal agreement as is and come round to Macron’s way of thinking: That there is little point in offering this country a three-month extension as ­Parliament will just waste the time.One No source predicts that the sight of the opposition blocking an election will “push the EU towards either the Macron position or a very long extension”.In a sign that Johnson’s gambit is having some success, the EU is waiting until Parliament has voted on an election before deciding whatof extension to offer.If this doesn’t work, the Government hopes it can shame Labour into having an election.The Chief Whip told those present that they would “make Labour look like right d***s”they didn’t vote for an election.But not everyone is convinced this will work.One of those present tells me thatthey were a Labour MP, they would “rather look like a d*** than lose their seat”.I understand, though, No intends to bring multiple votes to try to force an election. One Cabinet minister who has discussed this strategy with Johnson tells me: “Every time , it advertises that they are not prepared to support Brexit or have an election.“It reinforces the sense that he is the only person trying to get things done.”Johnson himself has told allies thatLabour rejects his offer to pass the withdrawal agreement and have an election, then it will be an “effective demonstration” that this Parliament won’t — and can’t — break the current deadlock.Proving this Parliament can’t break the deadlock is one thing. Actually breaking it is quite another.One of those present on Thursday tells me Johnson seemed genuinely angry at Labour’s refusal to give him an election and “betrayed a sense he’s cornered”.Something must happen before January , though.If it doesn’t, the threat of No Deal will be back on the table.Andthe UK has wasted this extension, European patience may snap and they might not offer another one.One senior Cabinet minister tells me “there will be an attempt to use an SOto put the Withdrawal Agreement Bill before the House”. This would involve the rebel group around Oliver Letwin trying to bring the deal back to Parliament so that the Commons could vote on it. But it is far from clear whether this approach could work.Another possibility is the Opposition bringing down the Government. If they did this, they would have to agree on an alternative prime minister or end up in a general election.British politics looks more deadlocked than ever today. Johnson’s hope is that pressure from voters will eventually break this deadlock and sweep away the obstacles to him passing his Brexit deal.But he will almost certainly have to put up with a delay both to Brexit and the election before he can get his way.NO one at political Cabinet spoke against the idea of a December election. But privately, several ministers have grave doubts about the wisdom of this strategy.One frets: “Who jumps out of bed on a cold December morning to vote for the Government ”There is a view that the Government could have used getting the Commons to approve its deal in broad terms as a spur for pressing on with the ­legislation, bringing a new timetable to the Commons after MPs rejected its initial offer of three days’ debate. One complains that the election idea is “a massive distraction”.“Why aren’t we using the momentum of getting a second reading ” they ask.On the backbenches there are also concerns. One senior backbencher tells me: “We’ll vote for an election with great reluctance.”He worries that “being seen to try not very hard to get the bill through” undercuts the new Tory message that they are the deal party.The other great worry is that while the public mood is with Boris Johnson now, that could change. One minister warns it is a huge risk to have a “winter election at a very febrile time”, adding: “We’ve no idea what public opinion will be on polling day.”IF Boris Johnson gets his way and there’s a general election this year, what happens to those Tories who lost the whip for voting for the Benn Act At Thursday’s gathering, Nicky Morgan argued that the party needed “clarity” on what would happen to those who had lost the whip but had voted with the Government against the Letwin amendment and for the Brexit deal and the accelerated timetable for passing it.Boris Johnson has previously been adamant that he would not allow any of the  to stand as Tory candidates at the next election. But I am told he made sympathetic noises in response to Morgan’s point.Inside Boris Johnson’s circle, there’s the beginnings of a sht in attitude. There is a feeling that those who have consistently voted with the Government in recent weeks are worth bringing back in.With a deal secured, the issue that led to their rebellion has been addressed.At the same time, several of these MPs would be better placed to hold their seat for the Tories than any other candidate.AT political Cabinet on Thursday, Boris Johnson pointed at the Northern Powerhouse Minister Jake Berry and said “Kwasi”, a reference to Kwasi Kwarteng the Energy Minister.Cabinet ministers were baffled at how the PM confused the two.They don’t look at all alike.After Berry deadpanned, “An easy mistake to make”, the room fell about laughing.A Budget would offer the Tories a chance to outline some of their more popular economic policies and highlight plans to boost infrastructure.If the Opposition voted it down, it would make the case for the election Boris Johnson so desperately wants.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When the nation voted on whether or not to leave the EU, it was boiled down to the simplest possible question and answer: Yes or No.So the die was cast and we voted to split with the EU. But that’s the thing about orce.Between the time you say you want one, and the time you actually get your decree nisi there is a whole lot of pain as the time is filled with blame, retribution and name-calling.Because of the lack of clarity from the vote on what it meant to leave, no one thought about the most important aspects, the red lines, of how Britain should leave the EU.It didn’t need a clairvoyant to predict that lots of those dferent Brexit visions would be fundamentally incompatible.We can’t stay in the customs union and have complete control of immigration.We can’t have no hard border on the island of Ireland the Good Friday Agreement and also leave the single market. I could go on.The point is that the nation answered Yes or No to something that — it turns out — our politicians have decided to interpret in multiple ways.And that has been the fundamental problem.Because MPs have been unable to compromise in order to find a deal that pleases them enough for it to be passed. And the public despair.Politics only s effectively when a party has a clear majority to get their legislation through government. And this one doesn’t.It’s no surprise that neither party has a clear majority while they are being led by the more extreme and dogmatic elements.I was in the House of Lords and the House of Commons on Wednesday and the contrast in atmosphere between the two is stark.Politicians in the Commons don’t listen or pay each other any respect.And the amount of average front bench MPs on both sides is shameful. No wonder we have stalemate.There is an unbridgeable gulf between Leavers and Remainers, and an inability among politicians to compromise.We’ve either got to leave with No Deal or we have to revoke Article  altogether.There is nothing in between, no room for compromise or pragmatism. As a result, we are paralysed. So the answer has to be to have a general election.Usually it’s politicians who tell us what to do for the good of the country, but now we need to tell the politicians what to do.Because only with a majority government can we put an end to the Brexit misery.Although who relishes the prospect of voting on a dark December night  Least of all Jeremy Corbyn, the only Opposition leader in history who has refused the offer of an election more than once.It’s no wonder when you look at the polls. He’s unelectable, but still using his position to block Brexit and stop us from getting on with it.Until there is an election we remain in this terrible limbo. I voted Remain but, like most people, now I just want it over with.Politicians must stop using Brexit for their own political aims.If they don’t soon come up with a solution, the risk is that people are increasingly likely to vote for extreme options in a bid to make it stop.And that is a scary prospect.WHEN it comes to le choices I am a big believer in the live and let live school of thought.Andpeople choose to have cosmetic surgery because it makes them feel better, that’s their choice.But in the latest photos of Lauren Goodger her flawless complexion and insanely pillowy pout are so extreme I didn’t realise it was her.Which, to me, raises the question of why anyone would want to render themselves completely unrecogniseable IT is ironic that one of the most important causes of our time – climate change – is being eclipsed by the behaviour of the very people professing to be addressing the issue.Following last week’s debacle with the protestor on the Tube at Canning Town, this week a jobless Extinction Rebellion protester who spray-painted a war memorial has been ordered by a judge to pay £ as punishment for “senseless vandalism”.The volunteer tree-planter, Joseph O’Malley, wrote the word “mother” on the ft tall bronze sculpture in Whitehall last November, Westminster Magistrates’ Court heard.And protestors who act like this wonder why we have no sympathy for them.Meanwhile, this year’s ongoing Extinction Rebellion protests have so far cost the taxpayer £million, it emerged this week.Sure, their argument would be that the cost to the taxpayer will ultimately be a lot more than thatwe do nothing about climate change.But these tactics and statistics make me seethe with anger.I, like most of us, have to go to work so people like O’Malley can choose instead to spend their time damaging a memorial dedicated to heroes who sacriced their lives so that, ironically, yobs like him can enjoy freedom.In my view a fine is not enough. His benefits should be stopped and he should be jailed for such a disgraceful and disrespectful act.Make no mistake, stopping climate change is essential for all of our futures.But these tactics are not only distracting and damaging to that cause they are actively counter productive.But put together with another story this week showing that the number of children aged between eight and  with anorexia has doubled , it is a good reminder that we should all keep an eye on our children’s phone use.ANYONE  catch Nigella Lawson’s ultimately down to earth confession that she followed up an evening of fine dining at Noble Rot, a snazzy award-winning restaurant in London, by eating a bag of pickled onion Monster Munch in bed.You’ve got to love the fact that after eating oysters, black pudding and venison Nigella has a Monster Munch nightcap.I am fully supportive. It’s just that, well, in bed  I can think only of the crumbs.SO sorry to hear about Amanda Holden’s bad luck breaking her leg on holiday at half-term.Buther cloud has a silver lining it is surely the fact that there are not that many people who could manage to look quite so glamorous with a leg that’s broken in two places.THIS week it was announced that jail sentences for terrorists will be increased.The Sentencing Council will propose changes to its guidelines after Parliament passed a new anti-terror law earlier this year which allowed for longer terms of imprisonment.Under the moves, the “starting point” for judges when jailing someone for “encouragement of terrorism” will double to ten years in the worst cases.But isn’t there something wrong with the fact that laws to delay Brexit get passed in hours, yet laws like this take months GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At first people were being a bit coy about it and sending texts just saying ‘Welcome ’“And then it started to blow up on social media, people saying they’d bought  uni books for nothing and some were even saying a personal thanks to Jeff Bezos for messing up so bad.“It must have cost Amazon hundreds of thousands of pounds and it was only discovered on Thursday evening, but by that time everyone had gone crazy.“I started sending stuff home to my mum as we didn’t have room for any more in the flat. Obviously it meant a lot of packaging lying around but to be honest our flat wasn’t all that tidy anyway.“When the code went down on Thursday night we were gutted. My mate came to my room and said ‘Welcome is over!“I’m pretty sure Jeff Bezos can afford it, he’s worth  billion so it won’t affect the bottom line too much and Amazon can be certain they’ll always have a special place in our hearts.”Another student, Ryan from Nottingham Trent University, said: “I mostly used the code to bulk buy food, stationary, art supplies, charging cables and cleaning supplies.I saved £ on  items.

Goldman, said the pilots admitted to Steinaker that she and others had been filmed.Its really hard to imagine a more outrageous kind of conduct, he said.Steinaker took a photo of the iPad with her phone and showed it to her fellow attendants.She also alleges that, having reported the incident to the airline, she and other crew members were told not to discuss it.An official allegedly said: If this got out,this went public, no one, I mean no one, would ever fly our airline again.Steinnker also claims that she and husband David, also a flight attendant with the airline, faced retaliation after she lodged her complaint.She says Southwest engaged in a pattern of retaliation and monitoring efforts, including a greater number of performance audits and random drug tests, intended to silence and intimidate the couple and others.Graham and Russell, who both deny the claims, continue to work as pilots for the airline.A statement released by Southwest Airlines said: The safety and security of our employees and customers is Southwest’s uncompromising priority.At this time, we have no other comment on the pending litigation."},{"url":null,"title":"urban spaces pocket parks plan","story":"Unloved and derelict urban spaces will be transformed as communities bid for a share of a pot worth more than £ million.The neglected spaces will be turned into children’s play areas or vegetable patches and paving the way for events to bring neighbours together.Ministers will make £, for refurbishment of existing parks and £, for developing new green spaces.Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said: “We want to improve the mental and physical health of local people by providing a sustainable and affordable sanctuary away from the hustle of urban le.“Establishing more pocket parks is part of our wider ambition to ensure that communities have a real sense of identity and place.”Whitehall has also awarded nearly £ million for local authorities to better maintain and protect their recreational spaces.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

NO ONE has yet been prosecuted over the catalogue of ­failings which led to the disaster.A police investigation is ­ongoing and there is a separate public inquiry led by retired Appeal Court judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick.Police said in March that ­criminal charges would not be considered until the second and final phase of the public inquiry has finished — which could take up to two years.But survivors of the blaze have now called for the findings of phase one, due to be announced on Wednesday, to be used to help bring those responsible to book.Karim Mussilhy, who lost his uncle in the fire and is vice chair of the bereaved families and survivors group, Grenfell United, said: “This report won’t bring our loved ones back, but it could save others.“It is so important those responsible are held to account. There will have to be ­prosecutions.”But, more than  months since the blaze on June , , people are wonderingthey will ever get justice.Karim, , said: “There are so many questions. Why did the fire spread so fast  Why has the fire brigade still not done evacuation training for high-rise buildings “There are still huge numbers of tower blocks with the same cladding and not enough is being done to improve social housing.“Grenfell Tower was not safe to live in. But the police investigation is separate to the report and we have yet to see a ­person face prosecution for how it was built.“Our message to Boris Johnson is please make sure this never happens again.”In addition to the  deaths,  people were injured in the Grenfell Tower disaster. A total of  escaped the blaze.Despite great aid efforts to look after survivors, many have been left in dire ­situations.We found that while  families have moved into new homes, eight are still in temporary accommodation and one is living in a hotel.Wheelchair-bound Mariko Toyoshima-Lewis, , and her three children were placed in a new home without disability access. Another former resident said she is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.Helen Gebremeskel, , took legal action against the council after she and her daughter Lulya, , were placed in a block of flats with lts. She said: “We cannot live in a block after what we went through.”Thankfully, Helen and her daughter are now in a West London flat after asking housing chiefs for a more suitable home.The council made £million from selling property in the five years before the tragedy — but cut spending at the same time.They even saved £, by using cheaper, more combustible cladding that made the tower block light up like a candle. Yet since the blaze some of those in charge have been busy rewarding themselves financially.Freedom of Information requests have revealed that  council leaders received a total of £, in bonuses last year — an average of £, per person. And  staff working in housing received £, in bonuses — £, per employee on average.This was a huge rise on the £, paid out in bonuses the year before the fire. Campaign group Justice for Grenfell said council members should “hang their heads in shame” over the “vulgar” sums.Nearly £million has been spent on hotels for the survivors — that’s five times the equivalent cost in today’s money of building the s tower block.In total,  bed-and-breakfasts and hostels have been used for ­temporary accommodation. The council has spent more than £million buying  homes for survivors.But a new building chosen to house families in Kensington has been deemed a fire risk itself.In August inspectors said the Hortensia Road block, a mile from Grenfell, has “errors” including “no evidence” cladding had been inspected. The public inquiry’s report on the fire has been  months in the making.The first phase of its conclusions out this week is expected to address why firefighters ordered Grenfell residents to stay in flats when an inferno was raging.It will also examine why  call-centre workers told tenants to stay in flats even when they said smoke or fire was in their homes. Jessica Urbano Ramirez, , died in the tower after being told by call operators to stay put and await rescue.Her aunt, Sandra Ruiz, has called on inquiry chairman Sir Martin not to hold back. She said: “The report had better be hard-hitting. “She trusted that person on the end of the phone was going to get her out.”The report should also give answers on whether the building was “non- compliant” given that it was wrapped in dangerous cladding and there was a lack of fire prevention measures such as sprinklers.This will form a key part of whether iniduals will be prosecuted. In July the Government’s safety  demanded that similar high-pressure laminate  be stripped from  buildings across the UK to make sure the disaster is not repeated, but progress has been slow.The families of  victims and  survivors are taking legal action against US firms Arconic, which manufactured the cladding, Celotex, which made the insulation, and Whirlpool, which owns Hotpoint, the make of fridge that is thought to have started the blaze.But their lawyers have claimed in court papers that Arconic has failed to produce key documents related to Grenfell’s refurbishment.An Arconic spokesman told The Sun: “What the claimants’ lawyers have said in their recent filings is not correct. Arconic is providing information in the US lawsuit.”For Grenfell United spokesman Karim, there are many questions from the report that need answers.He said: “There were so many failings. Even when the ‘stay put’ directive was lted  responders did not call ­people back to tell them to get out.“The Tenant Management Organisation and the council did not have an up-to-date list of tenants so the fire brigade had little idea who might be inside.”“We hope those giving evidence accept this and understand what their duty is. Grenfell can never happen again. If it does, the inquiry will have failed.“At the council, we believe our duty is to the truth only. Whatever it takes and ­whatever the consequences.”Ross, , said: “I feel like I have been left at the very bottom. Many times I have attempted or considered suicide.”On the night of the ­tragedy, he left Grenfell Tower at midnight. When he ed, it was ablaze.His dad Steve Power, , and their three pet dogs died in the inferno. Steve had been told to stay in their flat.Describing the aftermath, Bobby said: “I didn’t eat anything and I didn’t sleep during that first  hours.“For more than  years my dad had been telling them how dangerous the tower was. He was continually ignored.”Mariko’s wheelchair would not fit into the bathroom and she had to use facilities in a separate hotel.The family’s most recent home was temporary accommodation in Ladbroke Grove, West London, which was not fully adapted for a disabled person.Mariko, who has a spinal problem, has split with her husband.She said: “The council don’t care about human ­dignity. I want people to know what is going on.”On the night of the fire, she told her family to leave first so she would not slow them down.Mariko said: “I kept smiling at my children. I didn’t want them to panic.”“I told them, ‘Mummy is coming later’.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

By denying us a vote on his deal HE is now the one blocking Brexit.The  Labour manesto on which I was re-elected was clear: “Labour accepts the referendum result”.It promised we would “seek to unite the country around a Brexit deal that works for every community in Britain”.I repeated these words countless times in my constituency, a former mining area of Nottinghamshire that suffered under Conservative governments.I told them Labour would respect the  per cent of them who voted to leave, but that we would never stop fighting for a Brexit that brought them closer to prosperity not further away from it.This could be our last chance to keep that promise. That is why I voted with the Government on Tuesday.I did so not because I like Boris Johnson’s deal, but because I don’t like it and I want the chance to change it.This version of Brexit is flawed. It weakens workplace rights, consumer rights and environmental protections.It doesn’t include a customs union, which would be good for workers and businesses.This is not about supporting the Tories and their miserable agenda. It is about my role as an MP in opposition.I agree with John McDonnell, who said earlier this week: “By amending the Withdrawal Agreement Bill . . . MPs have an opportunity to reject the  choice between Boris Johnson’s bad deal and No Deal, and instead support an agreement that works for everyone.”I have signed Tory MP Ken Clarke’s amendment to stay in the customs union, safeguarding our economy and the many businesses that would sufferwe leave it. I want to make sure that working people are protected.I want to ensure that Brexit doesn’t give the Tories a chance to attack workers’ rights, as they have been doing for a decade.If we can’t get those changes, I won’t vote for the Bill at the final stage. In , I launched Labour’s Remain campaign alongside Jeremy Corbyn.I travelled the country making the case for the EU as the best way to guarantee workers rights, economic stability and environmental protections, among other things.But we lost that campaign. AndI stand for anything, I stand for respecting the voices and interests of working class people, who overwhelmingly voted to leave the EU.Some  per cent of those who voted to leave say that politicians don’t listen to people like them. It is these people I came into politics to give a voice to.I can’t ignore them on the major issue of our time. I know Labour colleagues who voted against the Government this week are also deeply committed to those voters.These decisions are not easy for any of us. There is an appetite for compromise in the country which is not reflected in Parliament.Earlier this year, I invited both passionate Leavers and Remainers in my constituency to meet. The debate was lively, but there was none of the shouting and jeering we see in Parliament.The majority of Remainers said they were willing to respect the result and Leavers still wanted to leave — but with a deal, not without one.If voters can compromise, why can’t politicians  I didn’t come into Parliament to protest, but to deal with the world as it is, and make it a bit better.However I can, I want to tell my constituents that I did everything I could to get the Brexit nearly  per cent of them voted for, while protecting jobs and rights in the process.Shortly after the referendum I was at a bus stop in my constituency. I was chatting to a woman and the conversation turned to Brexit. Having voting to leave the EU, she asked: “Do you think it will actually happen ”I didn’t hesitate to say, “Of course! We are a democracy and that’s how people voted.” I never thought that three-and-a-half years later we would still be arguing.If Boris Johnson really wants to deliver Brexit he has to do the one thing he’s so far failed to do — and that’s compromise. This General Election will be about so much more than Brexit.It is a chance for us to create a country where power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many and not the privileged few and I will be giving my all to bring that about.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He is looking to pile pressure on MPs on Monday to give him the two-thirds backing he needs to secure an election on December .But the Lib Dems and SNP , in a move that bypasses Labouraposs indecision, are to reportedly set to offer the Conservative Party leader an even easier route to an election - requiring just a simple majority in the Commons.But, crucially, the Lib Dems and SNP want the election to be held on December  - three days before Mr Johnsonaposs proposed date.If the European Union gives the UK a Brexit delay until January , as requested in Mr Johnsonaposs letter to Brussels last week, then the pro-Remain parties are prepared to give the PM the opportunity to have an election on new terms.Ian Blackford, the SNPaposs Westminster leader, confirmed he had co-signed a letter with Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson to European Council president Donald Tusk in which they sought an extension until January  at the earliest so that the risk of a devastating no-deal Brexit could be removed. He added: If that meaningful extension is secured we will then work together to bring forward an election this year - but on Parliamentaposs terms, not on the Prime Ministeraposs.    According to The Observer, the partiesapos MPs have drawn up a bill that would allow Mr Johnson to secure a December election with a simple majority of MPs, by-passing the need for two-thirds support. The draft law would grant an election on December  - three days before the PMaposs proposed date and, crucially, when more students are still at university to cast their votes in Remain-supporting target swing seats.The move indicates a split between opposition leaders on whether to go for a December campaign, with Labour putting off their decision on how to vote on Monday. Leader Jeremy Corbyn said he wanted to wait until EU ambassadors had finalised their decision, expected on Monday or Tuesday, over theof an extension for Article  .Mr Corbyn, speaking on a campaign visit to Motherwell, North Lanarkshire on Saturday, said: We will be very happy to fight an election once all vestiges of a no-deal exit from the EU have been taken off the table. But the Government reiterated it had no intention of ruling out a clf-edge orce, with Business Minister Kwasi Kwarteng telling BBC Radio aposs Today programme: No-deal canapost be taken off the table. The PM ramped up the rhetoric on Sunday as he looks to encourage MPs to grant him a trip to the polls when Parliament s on Monday. He wants an election on December  but requires two-thirds of MPs -  out of  - to back the move under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act.

Fiona Hill says she was forced to become the then-Prime Ministeraposs full-time minder after she aposbegan to crumbleapos amid mounting criticism of her campaigning and the Tory election manesto. Hill makes the claims in a new biography which says May, who quit as PM earlier this year, insisted that she did not want the presidential-style campaign to be focused on her. Historian Sir Anthony Seldon has interviewed nearly all of the influential figures during her premiership for his book, May at , and he concluded the campaign “cruelly exposed her unusually inflexible and introverted character”.    The biography, serialised in the Times , claims the controversy over the eventually revised social care policy - labelled the aposdementia taxapos - led to the unravelling of May’s credibility.Her team had thought the most likely manesto backlash would come over a fuel allowance change, he writes. Social care had played well in focus groups when tested. [May’s election adviser Lynton] Crosby approved of it. The sceptic was Hill, who foresaw what would happen. It became the focus of her most bitter disagreement with [fellow No  chief of staff Nick] Timothy during their time together in No . May backed him. ‘If I don’t have it in my manesto, it will become an empty manesto,’ she said.    Seldon says former aides told him that May sought to avoid speaking to journalists or revealing personal details. “This is not what I believe in,” she reportedly said. “I want to be out campaigning.” Hill, with Timothy, said she was forced to travel by May’s side. “She was surly and not particularly pleasant,” she told Seldon. “She was very quiet and seemed unhappy.”    Another said: She was a terrible campaigner. She came across as grumpy, entitled and expecting to win, and then visibly irritated when she came under scrutiny. The criticism reached such a level that on social media the PM was dubbed RoboMay for her robotic and repetitive style of delivery.The Conservatives had been expected to win a landslide victory in June , but although the party increased its share of the vote it lost  seats and its majority as support for Labour surged.   However, after the election result May is said to have blamed her advisers and complained bitterly that she had done exactly what they had told her to do and this was the result. Timothy offered to resign in the aftermath, at which point Hill recalls May as saying: “I think you both need to resign. May was also criticised over what was said to be her failure to show a strong face to the public after terrorist attacks in Manchester and London.Seldon, the vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham who has also written political biographies of Margaret Thatcher, John Major, Tony Blair , Gordon Brown and David Cameron, writes that the campaign “cruelly exposed her unusually inflexible and introverted character”."},{"url":null,"title":"airbnb horror shrieking family wake","story":"NewsAirBnb horror as shrieking family wake to find wasps crawling all over themThe family of Suzy Cross from Manchester experienced the stuff of nightmares at the London flatShareCommentsByAmy Sharpe:,  OCT NewsSuzy and husband Stephen \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Reverend Nick Evans was handed a -month ban by magistrates after he drove home from a restaurant at more than twice the legal limit. Police, believed to have been tipped off by a member of the public, arrested the cleric at his home. His breath test reading was mgs of alcohol per ml of breath. The legal limit is mg of alcohol. It is understood the Rev first claimed he’d had a drink after he got back to his place in Newport Pagnell, Bucks – but officers found alcohol listed on his restaurant bill. The Rector of Newport Pagnell with Lathbury  Moulsoe pleaded guilty at High Wycombe Magistratesapos Court and was last week handed a £, fine along with the driving ban.  But he may now get the good book thrown at him by his church. A spokesman for his diocese said: “The news of Rev Evans’ conviction is an extremely serious matter. “Our clergy are called to an exemplary standard of moral behaviour. “There can be no separation between the public and home le of ministers and there can be no excuse for his actions. “Drink-driving knowingly puts others at risk and it will not be tolerated by the Diocese of Oxford under any circumstances. “The diocese is investigating the matter under its own disciplinary framework.” Four-times married Rev Evans has apologised. He told the Sunday Mirror: “It is true I was recently convicted of driving over the legal limit for alcohol. I acknowledge my lack of judgement and failure regarding this since church leaders should strive to set an example at all times. “I am deeply sorry for what has happened.” But this is not the first time Rev Evans has found himself in an almighty row.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe mum of missing chef Claudia Lawrence hit out tonight at the “peanuts” budget to probe suspect Christopher Halliwell. Police have only £, to investigate the double killer’s possible links to the murder of a number of ­women, including that of Claudia, . Karen Edwards, , whose daughter Becky was one of two women ­slaughtered by cab driver Halliwell, said: “It’s an insult to the memory of those who are still waiting for loved ones to come home.” And Joan Lawrence, , whose ­missing daughter Claudia is one of the potential victims, said: “There are so many other people and crimes that Halliwell has been linked to. “It’s impossible for the force to carry out a proper review with such a small amount of money.” Halliwell, , is serving le for killing sex worker Becky, , and Sian O’Callaghan, , who was going home from a nightclub in Swindon, Wilts, when he abducted and murdered her.    The ex-CID chief who caught him – played by Martin Freeman in this month’s hit ITV drama A Confession – fears Halliwell could be one of Britain’s worst serial killers. He has been linked to at least  other murdered or missing women. His stomach-churning secret trophy store of  items of women’s clothing indicated he may have raped and­ murdered many more. But Wiltshire Police have allocated only £, to a cold-case review codenamed Operation Major. The existence of the taskforce and the funding, led by Det Supt Jeremy Carter, was ­uncovered by the Sunday People using the Freedom of Information Act. But the force refuse to saythey have made any ­arrests or taken a single statement since launching the review in . The £, has been branded “peanuts” by a retired detective who led a review into ­murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler’s case.    And mums Karen and Joan, who have forged a strong bond, are united in their condemnation of the small amount. Karen said: “You will never, ever, ever get closure butthe police response was adequate then at least some loved ones could put them to rest. “To put £, into the investigation is despicable. “Halliwell will ­never confess ­anything. He wants to have an element of mystery and will never disclose anything.” “But there will be loads of evidence and I am adamant that Halliwell is a serial killer, one of the worst in history. “It just makes me sick. They should be doing more to help the loved ones of his victims so they can give them the burial they should have.” And Joan said: “How could they possibly put in such a small amount  “If there are so many other victims how far can this go   “It’s an insignicant figure. Victims’ families want peace and they’ll never get it with this level of investment. “There’s law in this country but ­unfortunately not a lot of justice.” Ex-Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher, who put Halliwell behind bars, said Claudia’s disappearance “fits Halliwell’s pattern of behaviour” of abducting women walking alone late at night or early in the morning. Only two of Halliwell’s ­“trophy” items have ever been ­identied. One was a cardigan worn by Becky, who disappeared in Swindon in  and a high-heeled boot that Sian was wearing before she was abducted in . Halliwell is feared to have killed up to  more women including Claudia, mum-of-four Linda Razzell who the killer was said to be obsessed with after doing building work at her home, and ­university ­graduate Melanie Hall, who disappeared in  after leaving a nightclub in Bath. Halliwell could be linked to further unsolved murders including those of Julie Finley, Carol Clark, Jackie Waines and Yvonne Fitt. Becky’s mum Karen has carried out her own investigations, and in  discovered a possible link between Halliwell and Claudia Lawrence.  Her enquiries uncovered a witness who claimed Halliwell had been seen talking to Claudia through a taxi ­window before she vanished in York in March . Halliwell’s dad lived in Huddersfield, an hour from Claudia’s home, giving him a link to the Yorkshire area. Karen said at the time: “The description of Claudia’s [alleged] murderer is identical to [Christopher Halliwell] – a left-handed smoker, ft -ins, with slightly receding hair and a skinny build. Claudia was askinghe had change so she could ring her dad from a call box.” Officers at Wiltshire Police initially refused to say how much they were spending on the cold case review. They claimed the information would “further perpetuate the distress of the family, friends and those who knew Becky and Sian”. But after the Sunday People ­appealed against the decision, cops admitted the dedicated fund was no more than £,. Retired police chief Kevin Moore, who led a review into the hunt for -year-old Milly Dowler’s killer Levi Bellfield, , said: “In policing terms this figure is ­peanuts.” Mr Moore revealed he once spent £, on a forensic dig linked to Scottish serial killer Peter Tobin.  The ex-Chief Superintendent of Sussex Police said: “£, will not go very far at all. What it says to me is that this is simply an ­appeasement exercise ­because the force are under pressure and Halliwell’s crimes won’t go away. “They need to be seen to be doing something. “Butyou consider the costs of forensics, especially on the  items of clothing they discovered, this is a drop in the ocean.” Halliwell murdered Sian O’Callaghan just two minutes after she got into his cab in Swindon on March , . She had been brutally beaten and stabbed. Having guided cops to the remote spot where he had dumped her body, Halliwell suddenly ­confessed: “I’m a sick f***er. I need help. Do you want ­another one ” The fiend then revealed where cops could find Becky’s body – who police did not even know was missing. Catching a double killer led to Det Supt Fulcher being hailed a hero by the families and twice ­nominated for the Queen’s Police Medal. But his decision to break police guidelines and drive Halliwell to where he thought Sian might be found alive, instead of taking him to the police ­station for a formal interview, cost him his job. Halliwell was convicted in  of murdering Becky and given a whole le sentence. Det Supt Jeremy Carter, of Wiltshire Police, said: “The figure of £, does not cover any of the salaries of those working on this case but relates purely to specialist work such as forensic digs and searches, and specic expert advice. “Officers working on this case carry out a vast amount of work as part of their daily duties which would not be ­captured in this figure. “The force continue to maintain dedicated staff who work on this job.” POTENTIAL VICTIMS OF CHRISTOPHER HALLIWELL CLAUDIA LAWRENCE  Chef Claudia Lawrence, , disappeared between the night of March  and morning of March   in York. A witness later said he saw Christopher Halliwell talking to Claudia through a taxi window. Halliwell’s absent father once lived “a few streets” from where she was last seen and it is possible he knew the historic city. SALLY ANN JOHN  Sex worker Sally Ann John, , vanished in September  near Christopher Halliwell’s Swindon home. Despite continuous appeals, she has never been found. She allegedly sent a postcard shortly after she disappeared - but police later ruled this as a fake. SANDRA BREWIN Sandra Brewin disappeared from her parents’ home in  aged  just months after she became pen-friends with a man in prison in Oxfordshire. LINDA RAZZELL  MUM-of-four Linda Razzell, , disappeared from Swindon in . Her husband Glyn was convicted of her killing but continues to protest his innocence. Halliwell was said to be obsessed with Linda four years before her murder after doing building work on their home in Swindon. VERA HOLLAND  Vera Holland’s partially clothed body was found on a tip in Berkshire in November . The -year-old had been strangled, dumped among rubbish and her body set on fire. Cold case cops later confirmed they were working to seeChristopher Halliwell could be responsible. TINA PRYER  University of Bath cleaner Tina Pryer, , has not been seen since she vanished on April , , when she got into a taxi near her home town of Trowbridge, Wilts. THI HAI NGUYEN  Vietnamese immigrant Thi Hai Nguyen, , has not been seen since she went missing from her temporary home in June . She had only been in the town for a matter of weeks and her disappearance was not widely publicised or appealed for as it was thought at the time that she may have simply moved on to a dferent city or travelled back home. JULIE FINLEY  Julie Finley, , vanished from the centre of Liverpool on August , , and was found strangled a day later in Rainford, Lancs. Halliwell is said to have lived just four miles from the field where Julie’s naked body was dumped. CAROL CLARK  Carol Clark, , was snatched from the Bristol red light district in March  and dumped in a canal at ­Sharpness, Glos. Pathologists believed she had either suffered a heavy blow to the neck or been strangled. Halliwell lived  miles away at the time and was a narrowboat enthusiast with a good knowledge of the canals. JACKIE WAINES  Jackie Waines was a -year-old mum-of-three who was abducted from Bristol’s red light district and murdered in . Her body was dumped on a bridlepath at Frampton Cotterell, Glos. She was stabbed repeatedly. Halliwell was at the time living  miles away in Highworth, north of Swindon, Wilts. YVONNE FITT  A mother who had worked as a prostitute in Leeds, Yvonne last seen on January , , in Bradford –  miles away from Halliwell’s dad’s home in Huddersfield. Her murdered body was discovered in a shallow grave outside Otley, West Yorkshire. MELANIE HALL  University graduate Melanie Hall, , disappeared in  after leaving a nightclub in Bath, Somerset.

Bobby, , said: “I wouldn’t let them try the outfits on before in case they backed out, but on the day, they loved it. They cried tears of bemusement when they saw the dresses. “We were all in hysterics. I was a size  and they were all s. “Ciara and the girls had no problem buying their tuxes, but we had a lot of trouble. “A lot of places didn’t want me to try stuff on. The bridal places we tried were reluctant, so I ended up buying online.” Ciara, , added: “The bridesmaids were fine with the suits – girls can look really good in suits. “But my brother was one of Bobby’s groomsmen and he kept texting me, ‘when are we getting our suits ’. I had to say, ‘you aren’t getting one’. “Because they are all hairy and tattooed, it was funnier.”  Bobby, an HR executive from Swansea, South Wales, even persuaded his dad Linton to walk him down the aisle. “When I told my dad what we were doing he shook his head, looked at the ground and said, ‘What are you like ’ “He didn’t give me a pep talk – just said, ‘let’s get this done’. Bobby admitted he was a bag of nerves before his appearance in front of their  guests in Belfast last month.  “When the door opened, everyone there erupted in applause and laughter. It really carried me down the aisle,” he said. The couple wrote most of their own vows – and exchanged balls and chains, as well as rings.  Bobby said: “Although the service was quite funny and shocking – we weren’t doing it to make a mockery of marriage. “It was a big thing for both of us, all the words in the service were so personal.” The couple hooked up three years ago – despite a cringe-making first meeting. Bobby was on holiday in Barcelona when he and a mate popped into a pub, where he spotted Ciara serving behind the bar. Assuming she was Spanish and couldn’t understand English, he started telling his friend how much he fancied her.  “I thought she was a sexy Spanish girl, with beautul eyes, with a proper naughty glint in them,” he said. “I was chatting to my mate saying, ‘oh, she’s stunning’ and it turned out she was Irish and understood everything I was saying.” Bobby and his pal had only gone into the bar for one drink, but he ended up staying there all day and he and Ciara shared a kiss later that night. “I fell in love with her the moment she opened her mouth. She’s got the most savage personality,” he said. Ciara said Bobby’s infectious laugh was the main source of attraction. She said: “We just clicked straight away, we laughed so much. “To meet a partner you can laugh with all the time – I’ve never been with a guy before who’d wear a dress for me. He just doesn’t care.” "},{"url":null,"title":"i grew up shadow truck","story":"NewsI grew up in shadow of truck bomb terrorist - but I am nothing like my fatherEXCLUSIVE: Despite growing up in the shadow of extremism with a notorious terrorist for a father, Zak Ibrahims path is completely dferent, now working with charity Tuesday’s Children, which supports kids affected by terrorismShareCommentsByGrace Macaskill :,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsThis picture of Zak as a little boy being pushed on a swing by his father was actually taken on prison grounds\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

But there is a very dark side to these seemingly innocent photos. The man shooting the picture in front of New York’s Twin Towers would plot to blow them up. And though he looks happy to be swinging his son, the photo was taken in prison grounds. Killer El Sayyid Nosair, , is still behind bars. And his son Zak Ebrahim, now , has turned his back on his terrorist father. Nosair was jailed for shooting dead a right-wing Jewish leader.    From his cell he plotted the  truck bombing of the World Trade Center. The attack killed six and injured ,. It was a grim rehearsal for the   ­atrocities that took nearly , lives and flattened the towers. Zak, who was four when his dad took the photo at a park near their home in New Jersey, now helps victims of terror, including a teenage girl who was badly injured in the  Manchester Arena bomb attack. Despite growing up in the shadow of extremism he said: “I am not my father. I want people to look at me and know they don’t have to choose the path of violence and intolerance.” Zak works with the charity Tuesday’s Children, started after  , which ­supports kids affected by terrorism through counselling, family networks and mentoring.  He said: “I did a university TED talk for YouTube about my past and last year got an email from a young woman ­involved in Manchester who had watched it. She told me it had given her hope that things and people could change. “Her message came at a time when I was feeling quite low myself and I saw it as a gt. We’ve had candid ­discussion about depression and trauma and what effect it’s had on her. She was ­injured and has been through a few surgeries but she’s brave, smart and thoughtful.” Zak became part of the Forgiveness Project charity that tells the real stories of victims and criminals to help people explore ideas of leniency and understanding. He has been on a long journey over his dad, often filled with sadness and confusion, which started in the middle of one night in November . Bleary-eyed, seven-year-old Zak, wearing his favourite Teenage Ninja Turtle pyjamas, was woken, along with his siblings, by his mum. She claimed their dad had been in an accident and grabbed everything she could carry from drawers and wardrobes. They fled to relatives. Actually Nosair had been arrested for shooting dead Rabbi Meir Kahane, the then-leader of the far-right Jewish Defense League, in a Manhattan hotel.  It was the start of a nomadic, poverty-stricken le for the now single mum and her kids. They moved  times in ten years, ­initially to escape death threats from JDL extremists, then later to hide from her own husband. Zak said: “Mum had gone from being a teacher with a ­husband who was an ­electrician to being a single mum with no money.” The family kept moving and changing their names and Zak was always the new boy bullied at school. He did see his dad at the maximum security Attica Correctional Facility in New York while Nosair was awaiting trial. The boy looks really happy being pushed by his father on a swing. Egyptian-born Nosair was acquitted of killing of Rabbi Kahane but jailed for  years for attempted murder over the shooting and wounding of a postal ­worker during the attack. After the  plot he admitted shooting Kahane. Zak recalled the arrest came out of the blue and his mum had been shocked. He said: “We were a strict religious family and went to the mosque but Dad was just an ­ordinary dad to me. I recall he was kind and humorous man who had lots of friends that I called uncle.” But a few months before the killing Zak had a hint of his dad’s dark truth. The boy’s “uncles” took him to a shooting range on Long Island and when he luckily hit a bullseye one man turned to another and in Arabic said: “Like father, like son.” Nosair had also ­threatened to leave his family to fight against the Soviets in Afghanistan until Zak’s grandfather threatened to ­disown himhe ­abandoned his we and children.  At first Nosair’s family mounted appeals against his conviction but any hope Zak had of his dad’s ­release ended in February  with the bombing of the World Trade Center’s North Tower. A month before the blast Nosair was visited by Mohammed Salameh, who would be ­convicted of the bombing. The day after the attack Nosair phoned Salameh who was driving the van loaded with explosives. FBI agents also recovered up to  letters and documents from Attica linking Nosair to the terror cell. It emerged during the trial al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden had helped pay for his defence team. Nosair was given a le sentence and, away from her husband’s strict religious influence, Zak’s mother started ­reducing family visits. They ­eventually stopped. By  Zak was questioning the hatred his father had fostered. Zak said: “I grew up believing Jewish were evil, that gay people were evil. Mum turned to me one day and said ‘I’m tired of hating.’ “That was the day the world became a brighter place. It was like she was giving me ­permission to go out and explore the world without hatred.” Zak’s mum changed her name and has since remarried. While he doesn’t want to give away details for fear of reprisals he says both she and his older sister and younger ­brother are “doing fine”.

Théodore Clark Chamming’s beat the odds to survive after open heart surgery at eight hours old. His middle name pays tribute to the superhero’s alias. Baby Theo was diagnosed with rare defect, anomalous pulmonary venous, where vessels linking the heart and lungs are not connected properly - at just three hours old.    The tot’s tiny heart was stopped for an hour during emergency surgery so surgeons could make repairs. His mum Amanda, , said of her first-born: “They rushed him into theatre for emergency open heart surgery – we were warned he might not make it. It was a horric time for us. “Théodore spent two weeks in PICU and was hooked up to lots of wires so we couldn’t hold him. He had fluid on his lungs along with a number of other post-op complications, and at one point we were told we should prepare for the worst.” Incredibly, the youngster, who was treated at Evelina London Children’s Hospital, suddenly began breathing on his own. Amanda, from Hither Green, south east London, added: “Théodore really is our determined little Superbaby who has fought his way through.” His dad Alex, , who has Superman t-shirts, pajamas and posters, pushed for his son to be named after Clark Kent, the heroaposs alias.    And Théodore has since proved he is every bit as strong as the Man of Steel - as he is now starting to walk and will celebrate his first birthday next month. Amanda, a lawyer said: “We are travelling to Scotland and throwing a family party. It’s amazing - though I am slightly anxious about the day as it will bring everything back.” The parents are taking on challenges to raise money for Evelina London, with hospitality boss Alex set to run the London Marathon in April.

Prices for the ACILIS bottles – sourced from a Malaysian rainforest – range from £. for six to £ for a large crate. PR guru and co-director Garratt told the People he sends autism support groups “free introductory samples” and parents of autistic kids “get a  per cent discount”. But two university professors have rubbished claims there is scientic support for therapeutic benefits for autism sufferers.   And a mother with two autistic children who the company approached via Twitter branded its operation “horrible”.Outraged Emma Dalmayne, who runs the Autistic Inclusive Meets support group, said: “The idea that water can cure autism is ludicrous. I’ve done lots of research into the science surrounding autism. “But other parents could have been taken advantage of, which is horrible. Many are vulnerable and all they want to do is protect their kids. Some are surviving on benefits caring for their children.” The Silica Waters website says it has “anecdotal testimonials” from parents who say the water has been of “signicant benefit”. The site also flags up research which claims a link between autism and high levels of aluminium in the brain, and suggests the water can reduce aluminium levels in the body. The blurb also suggests other health benefits of drinking silica-rich water regularly include helping MS.  But a People probe revealed that the scientist who wrote the papers the company relies upon is controversial academic Professor Chris Exley, who works at Keele University, Staffordshire. A GoFundMe page to raise funds for Prof Exley was banned amid claims it was promoting “misinformation about vaccines”.  He claimed in a scientic journal that tiny amounts of aluminium in jabs like the MMR are linked to autism. And he was once funded by the Children’s Medical Research Council, linked to the notorious US anti-vaxx lobby. The university has distanced itself from his findings, saying in June it “emphatically supports the NHS policy of vaccination”.  But Silica Waters is now pushing his theory that aluminium, found in everyday items such as tea and deodorants, can cause major neurological issues. When approached by the People, Garratt said: “We keep getting wonderful messages saying, ‘please keep this water flowing because it’s made such a dference to our child’.”   He confirmed he originally pledged  per cent of profits to Exley’s research – but the academic asked him to stop after he gave an initial £ to Keele University. He said: “It came to the professor’s attention it could be suggested he had a vested interest in the product.”  There is no suggestion Exley personally profited from cash given to his projects by Silica Waters. But Garratt is still asking for research donations to Exley’s research on the website. He said: “We are on good terms and share his research developments with our customers to keep them up to speed.”  Silica Waters, which operates as a trading name of Garratt’s PR firm, Link Us, sent an unsolicited message to Emma’s autism support group.  A rep said: “Lots of parents of autistic children tell us how our water has such positive effects on their children. Please note we also send free introductory samples to support groups.” When -year-old Emma, mum to Damien, , and Skylar, seven, asked them to explain how the water Emma, from Plumstead, South London, then said: “We have so many families that would benefit. Have you had any children cured of all symptoms of autism ” And she says the rep replied: “Many parents, some from other support groups, find improvements and write to us about this. Yes.”  Garratt and Latham denied telling parents their water could cure autism when we quizzed them.  Garratt, who worked in PR for the Malaysian tourist board, said: “The word yes would be taken out of contextit was suggested that reply was, ‘yes, this cures symptoms of autism’. We’d never say that because we have close relationships with many parents and they’d be happy to share with you that under no circumstances would we ever suggest this water can cure autism.” Latham added: “We are super-careful and don’t make unsubstantiated claims. We say many people have told us it helps them.” But askedshe personally thought the water could cure autism, she said: “I’ve got an open mind and so has Rex.”  Garratt, , from Hove, East Sussex, cites Exley’s research extensively. His site states: “Prof Exley’s research has shown a hypothesis linking aluminium accumulation in the body and neurological conditions, and revealed ... silica water removes aluminium from the body. Silica is also known to help promote softer skin, shinier hair and supple joints.” But small print stresses: “The link between aluminium neurotoxicity and neurological conditions remains a hypothesis.” Exley – pictured with Garratt in , holding a bottle of his water – last night insisted he had “no connection” to Silica Waters. He said: “We’ve shownyou drink anything rich in silicon it removes aluminium from your body. If other people interpret that to mean aluminium is the cause of autism and removing it could help, that’s their interpretation. “Silica Waters contacted us at Keele to offer  percent of profits, to fund research. My university turned that down. We received one donation for £-odd.” Exley said the crowdfunding was set up by a third party without his knowledge, adding: “Keele does not allow crowdfunding projects.” And responding to criticism from fellow academics, he said: “Name me an academic who is qualied in any way to criticise what we have done.” aposNo evidence for irresponsible claimsapos "},{"url":null,"title":"rafs new 100m f 35","story":"NewsRAF’s new £m F- stealth fighter jets have ‘beast mode’ with ,lbs of firepowerThe impressive jets are set to land on the UKs biggest warship in a BBC documentary Sunday nightShareCommentsByGrace Witherden:,  OCT NewsThe state-of-the-art jets \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

What I’ve seen since coming back is the mentality of the club changing.”And Butcher is calling on the fans to turn out in their numbers tomorrow as the Tangerines look to maintain their perfect home record on the back of three away defeats.And that kind of form, performing at two ends of the spectrum is something he and the rest of the squad are keen to put right.Butcher added: “All I can say to the fans is they need to get behind us still and they’re going to be our driving force to get us to where we need to be.“We need to make sure we’re not performing at two extremes.“We’ve been really extreme this season, going back and forth with results. The - derby win and - against Morton and then going away and losing two on the spin, you never see that coming but, ultimately, it’s about theof the season.“There’s a long way to go yet.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#.

Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring.

Her partner Rebecca Taylor read music as an organ scholar at Lincoln College, Oxford before attending the Royal Academy of Music where she was a Junior Fellow and completed the MA in Piano Accompaniment.The audience were introduced to the pair with an intense piece by Mozart about burning letters and it certainly woke us up. We moved onto Schubert’s #Du Bist Die Ruh# which was beautully controlled by both singer and pianist.This was contrasted with Shubert’s angsty #Gretchen am Spinnrade# and I commend Rebecca Taylor for playing the right hand part with ease. The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness.

Set in the Western Indian Territory just after the turn of the th century, the spirited rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys provides the backdrop for a love story between Curly, a handsome cowboy, and Laurey, a beautul farm girl.But the road to true love is a bumpy one, especially as sinister farm-hand Jud Fry has his sights set on Laurey, and hersquoll do whatever it takes to get her.But Laurey isnrsquot the only girl in Oklahoma with cowboy troubles. Her ditzy friend Ado Annie just loves it when a fella talks purty to her!

I have to say, he didnrsquot strike me as the typical villain. That was until I saw him in action during rehearsal!ldquoIrsquove always wanted to be an actor and be the bad guy, he said. ldquoI have to put on quite a low voice for my character.

I have some fantastic solos and I have been working on expanding my vocals to hit the powerful notes. I love having to put on an accent and Irsquove been working hard to perfect it.

further improvements are required across much of the local authorityambitious savings plans and satisfaction ratings are to be met.Audit Scotland carried out a major review into Scottish Borders Council between January and May.As well as interviewing councillors and senior officers, auditors sat in on meetings, reviewed documents and files, and held meetings with trade union representatives.While the resulting -page report card highlights an improving picture since the previous audit in , bosses have been told to communicate better and form better relationships with partners, such as NHS Borders.The report also highlights required improvements in some departments and the need for elected councillors to be better equipped for the tough decisions they face.Graham Sharp, chair of the Accounts Commission, told us: ldquoThe continued progress Scottish Borders Council has made to transform services is encouraging.\"Now it must focus on several critical areas including tackling underperforming services, ensuring councillors have the right training to enable them to fulfil their responsibilities and getting to grips with both staff and community engagement.Across the  performance indicators used in the Best Value Assurance Report, Scottish Borders Council was found to be below average in more than half.While education and social work are doing well, other aspects of the local authority arent quite making the grade.A lack of investment in creating employment and boosting tourism was criticised, as was the low amount of contracts awarded to local companies and the fall in the number of bills settled within  days.The deteriorating condition of local authority buildings was also highlighted.Problems since the outsourcing of IT services to multinational firm CGI - a -year contract worth pound million - were also raised by auditors.While the report identies the delays and issues which plagued customer access of the councils online services, auditors said it was too soon to gauge the impact of iPads taking over more traditional teaching methods in Borders schools from this year.And the methodology of farming out senior staff, such as the Executive Director for Commercial Activity spending four days of his week as managing director of the failed SB Cares, and the Executive Director for Strategic Partnerships seconded to the South of Scotland Enterprise Agency three days each week, was also questioned.The report stated: \"While this is a positive and innovative approach aimed at realising the councils wider ambitions, it must continue to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to deliver local services.\"But, perhaps, coming in for the most criticism was the current culture of secrecy and the need for better communication and engagement with staff, councillors and the public.The report stated: \"The council should be more effective in evaluating, managing and reporting its performance, bringing greater clarity on where and how its services need to improve.\"It also needs to get better at the reporting of performance - both in terms of information considered by members and in reporting to the public.\"Budgeting at the local authority, though, was applauded by auditors.And, during extremely dficult economic times, the managing to maintain its usable reserves in case of emergencies was also identied.Although Audit Scotland identied further development was needed for the ambitious Fit for  mid-term savings plan, which aims to trim pound. million from budgets by , the report is complimentary of cost cutting to date.The report stated: \"The council has a good record of achieving savings and has reflected the impact of demographic change on demands for services and pay increases for staff, in its financial plans.\"However, in common with all other councils, the financial outlook remains a signicant challenge.\"Council chief executive Tracey Logan welcomed the detailed analysis of her local authority.And she admitted many of the problems in the Audit Scotland report are already being tackled.She told us: \"We will take on board Audit Scotlandrsquos feedback and recommendations, many of which we had already identied ourselves and are taking action on, and continue to drive forward transformational change across all our services through our Fit for

Council will be asked rethink its controversial playparks proposals, following two petitions that were signed by over a thousand concerned residents.In May , the council agreed plans to consult on the possible closure of  small playparks it says are underused and falling into disrepair.Instead, the council plans to spend poundm over the next decade on six large playparks, three skateparks and four fitness shelters.However, following a backlash from residents in Hawick and Kelso, two petitions have been handed into the local authority objecting to the plans.Nine Kelso playparks are at risk of closure: High Croft Meadow Court Orchard Park Rosewood Gardens Springwood Rise Spylaw Park Sydenham Court Woodside Gardens and the Kelso petition has attracted  signatures.Ten playparks are at risk in Hawick: Bowden Road Burnfoot School Hawick Green Hislop Gardens Leaburn Drive Mayfield Millers Knowe Waverley Walk Wellington Court and Wilson Drive and the Hawick petition has attracted  signatures.Those petitions were presented to the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee today, October , so it could hear from the lead petitioners and decide how to respond.Appearing before the committee, Kirsty Wichary, lead petitioner for Kelso, told councillors: ldquoWhat do we want our towns to look like in the future  Financial constraints aside, do we not look to have a beautul Borders, with outdoor spaces for all to enjoy ldquoHow did we get to this point, where there is no money for these parks  Investing in new technology for education is to be applauded, butparents had a choice, which would they choose ldquoTechnology isnrsquot helping our children to lead healthy, well-rounded lives. The stress of being a youngster in the st century is enormous.ldquoWe should be investing in more play areas and green spaces instead of taking them away.ldquoThe thought of removing these playparks seems a very backwards step, a step towards a cultural desert and a future for our youngsters with more weight problems, more mental health issues and future generations unable to communicate effectively, even within their own peer groups.ldquoDo you really want to be remembered as the council who handed out iPads but took away the parks Hawickrsquos lead petitioner, Greg Dalgliesh, owner of the townrsquos Think Fitness  Less gym in Hawick, was unable to attend the meeting due to a family bereavement, soHawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer presented his petition on his behalf.He told the committee: ldquo mainly local residents, parents and family members in Hawick have chosen to exercise their right to object to a proposal that would see  playparks across the Scottish Borders, including  in Hawick, the largest town in the Borders, effectively close as a result of a disinvestment of financial support from this council.ldquoThe vast majority of these people and the many who support this action through other means are stakeholders in Scottish Borders Council. They live here, they are required to pay their council tax and, consequently, they have a right to determine how that money should be spent.ldquoI quote from the petition: lsquowe believe in this instance lsquobigger and better facilitiesrsquo should not be justication to remove the smaller playparks that are situated in the ious housing estates in Hawick and the Borders.ldquolsquoIt is very clear from the comments associated with this petition and via social media these smaller parks are still well used and have been described as a safe place to play and exercise on the doorstep of many homes.ldquo lsquoNot everyone can access the likes of Wilton Lodge Park on a regular basis, and children with additional needs also find these areas too busy and noisyrsquo.Councillors discussed a number of possible actions including sending the playpark proposals back out to the public for further consultation and gauging the opinion of community councils in affected areas.In the end, councillors voted to support sending a motion to the next full council meeting, scheduled for Thursdayasking it to reconsider giving authority to officers to determine which playparks can be closed.That motion was proposed by Tweeddale East councillor Heather Anderson and seconded by Selkirkshire councillor Elaine Thornton-Nicol.A counter motion, proposed by East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton and seconded by Jedburghrsquos Scott Hamilton, was also put forward, but it lost out to Ms Anderson and Ms Thornton-Nicolrsquos suggestionby five votes to three.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Wichary said: ldquoIrsquom very happy that itrsquos going to have to go back to the council to be reconsidered.ldquoIrsquom assuming, hopefully, that our petitions in both Kelso and Hawick have given them a lot of food for thought and that we wonrsquot see the closure of all the parks that were mentioned.ldquoItrsquos very clear that there are cost implications, but Irsquom quite confident that there will be some sort of compromise made.Mr McAteer added: ldquoI am delighted that the majority of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee have supported the Hawick petition designed to stop the council closing a number of our playparks.ldquoTheir decision will now resulted in this matter being referred to a full meeting of Scottish Borders council where elected members will decidefurther consultation and a reconsideration of this isive policy will take place.ldquoI am hoping that elected councillors will put aside their political dferences and respect the wishes of

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star. Kick off is pm, with Kintyre Park the expected venue.The Pupils’ Liam Renton on the ball with Ryan Gilchrist looking on at Saturday#s match in Paisley.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

But the firm has been dealt a major blow after its bid for a Government contract to buy the electricity produced by the windfarm failed. And the decision has brought angryreaction from the local community, who opposed the substation plans in the first place but were overruled by the Scottish Government.Scottish Ministers called in the substation plans after ruling the project to be of ldquonational importance last year, taking the decision out of the hands of East Lothian Council, the planning authority.Despite local representations opposing the substation, Scottish Ministers gave it the go-ahead in February amid claims it was necessary to move quickly to meet the deadline for the UK Government funding.But the UK Government announced its grants late last month and ICOL was not included in the list of successful projects, leaving the firm to rethink its future.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray said it appeared Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to ldquoride roughshod over local feeling ldquomight all have been for nothing.The former power station site was bought by the council last year and the local authority is marketing the land for economic development.However, the council was forced to reach an agreement with ICOL over a section of the site after the Scottish Government gave the substation the go-ahead.Mr Gray said: ldquoThe immediacy of the UK Government funding decision was the Scottish Governmentrsquos justication for riding roughshod over local decision-making and calling in the substation application in the first place.ldquoI opposed that decision to call in the application as unnecessary and anti-democratic and made the case for it being left in the hands of local people and their representatives.ldquoHowever, having put the local community through such uncertainty, it now appears that the Ministerrsquos heavy-handed interference in the sitersquos future might all have been for nothing.

The wind had a strange mildness in its touch.His grandson was in the joy of the moment, finding shells, climbing rocks and throwing stones into the sea. His grandfather watched, wishing he too could join in the fun. But age had crept up on him. His joints tweaked with pain every time he tried to behave like his younger self, making him very cautious. So he found a rock on which to sit and watched over his grandson as he explored.His thoughts were taken away from the beach and he began to think of his we. She had dearly loved their grandson but sadly she was only an image in a photograph for her grandson now. He was too young when she died to have any real memories of her. It was at moments like this that he missed her most, for she loved the beach. And at night, of course, for he was still unused to sleeping alone after  years of sharing the night with the woman he loved. It didnrsquot seem right, men were supposed to be outlived by women, not left behind like this.Suddenly, his attention was caught by the sight of his grandson wading into the sea, still wearing his shoes and socks.ldquoNo lad, yoursquoll...Too late, he was jumping in the waves, splashing and laughing. His granddad rose from his rock and walked over to him.ldquoCome on granddad, jump the waves with me, he called out, his face beaming with joy. The boyrsquos shoes were now completely soaked, as were the lower part of his trousers. The old man knew he would be in trouble with his daughter for allowing this to happen. Common sense told him to get annoyed and tell his grandson to come out immediately andto the car.ldquoI donrsquot think your mum will ever trust me again to look after you, he said.Another wave rolled in and the young lad screamed with delight and jumped over it.ldquoCome on granddad!The old man reckoned that the boyrsquos shoes were already soaked and a few more minutes in the sea wouldnrsquot make things any worse. He couldnrsquot bend down properly to take his own shoes off, but he waded into the sea anyway. He kept himself steady with his walking stick in one hand, and took the hand of his grandson with the other.They stood together and watched as a wave rolled in. The boy yelled with delight as he jumped over it, holding fast onto his granddadrsquos hand, who made his walking stick jump over it.ldquoAgain granddad, again, the young lad called out, laughing. Wave after wave came in and they faced them together.ldquoWe need to go now and get dry and warm up, said his granddad after a while.ldquoJust one more, please!And so they had one more wave jump together and headed for the car, both equally soaked. When they arrived at the car, their shoes and trouser bottoms were coated in sand, like breaded haddock.The boyrsquos mother was waiting in the car.She looked at their shoes and trousers. ldquoDad, what on earth have you been doing  His shoes are soaking and so are yours! I donrsquot believe it, what were you thinking  And now my car will be full of sand.ldquoI was thinking of your mum, he said. ldquoShe loved the beach and jumping the waves when we were young, and so did you when you were wee.ldquoYes, but not with our shoes on! said his daughter angrily, peeling off a sock from her son and pointing to his sodden shoes.ldquoLook at your shoes, dad, yoursquore not a child, you should know better.ldquoIt was so fun, mum, said her son, asto explain the state they were in.When they got back to the house, the granddad went to a cupboard and took out a box. He rummaged in it for while.ldquoAh, here it is, he said, holding an old photo album.He gave it to his daughter.She looked at it and smiled.ldquoCan I see  asked her son.So they all sat together with the photo.ldquoWell, thatrsquos your granny and that wee girl whose hand she is holding is your mum, said the granddad.ldquoThatrsquos my mum ldquoYes, and her mum, your granny, was loads of fun. They are jumping the waves together.ldquoLike us.ldquoYes, except your mum fell over and got her clothes wet.The old manrsquos daughter smiled. ldquoI remember that day so well, she said, ldquoit was so funny, didnrsquot mum fall and get her clothes wet as well ldquoShe did, said her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry about the shoes, he said, ldquobut I wanted the memory of today to be of fun, not of being told off because of the state of the clothes.

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council.

The eventrsquos tomorrow night.Oops.Chapter : In Which More Discoveries Are Made, Hideous And OtherwiseYoikes!Itrsquos a few minutes to midnight, the following evening. Irsquom crouching in the dark on the top floor of Provan Hall, when David, the professional medium standing next to me, says in a matter-of-fact voice: ldquoTherersquos a crawler coming up the stairs.A w-w-what !I glance over at the stairs. With only the dim glow from Davidrsquos torch, I make out shadows and nothing more. But David, being a medium, claims to be in possession of special powers. Ghosts are visible to him, he says, and they often tell him their tragic stories. He sometimes glimpses demons, too. Theyrsquore less sympathetic entities, as yoursquod imagine. The thing climbing the stairs towards us would appear to be of their ilk.Since I canrsquot see it, Irsquom understandably curious to know what this crawler looks like. Does it slither on flailing tentacles, or scuttle on a multitude of twitching legs ldquoIt looks sort of like Gollum, claries David, referring to the malicious creature from Lord of the Rings.David works with a group called Scottish Ghost Nights which organises a iety of spooky events throughout the country. They hold seances and late-night vigils in castles, derelict goals and stately homes.For tonightrsquos proceedings, the creepy quotient should be high, for itrsquos only a few days before Halloween, and Provan Hall has a distinctive ambience. Imagine yoursquore Hansel or Gretel, trudging through the tangled forest of your worst nightmares, when you stumble upon a sturdy, ancient house where a sweet old pensioner lives. And ndash oh joy! ndash her cooking potrsquos on the boil. Must be something yummy for dinnerhellipProvan Hall has a similar occult energy to that old pensionerrsquos gaff, though itrsquos built of sullen stone, not candy.Itrsquos a squatting toad of a house. Bathed in the clear autumn moonlight, its walls are bone-bland, pockmarked and bled of lustre, like the powdered face of a diseased French aristocrat awaiting Madame Guillotine.And Irsquom hunkered down inside that house, along with my new chum, David, another medium called Natasha, plus an assortment of ghost hunters and ghoul groupies, who paid to be here tonight, desperate to be scared witless.Therersquos twenty of us in total. Mostly women, with the occasional fear-loving fellow thrown into the mix.As the night progresses, Natasha also glimpses a demon, which she describes as looking like a ldquobarbequed monkey with not very nice eyes.David chimes in, too. ldquoItrsquos a shape-shter, he says. ldquoAnd it can climb the walls.Regrettably, once again I fail to glimpse this demon. Though being partial to anything barbequed, I do start to feel rather peckish.Luckily the ghost hunters have brought along scrummy cakes in Tupperware boxes, and we all have a hearty munch during a well-earned break. To be honest, Irsquom not really feeling the creeping sense of unease I experienced the night before, when I arrived early and alone.Itrsquos hard to get a satisfying shiver snaking down your spine when yoursquore in the company of a bunch of good-natured, cheerful ghost hunters. Wersquore all having a grand old time of it, you see, and thatrsquos a bit of a problem.A gaggle of giggling girls are on one side of me. Hen-night happy, hen-night hysterical. Also, many paying guests are wearing woolly hats topped with pom-poms. I mean, come on, guys! Would Jack Nicholson have been half as terrying in The Shininghersquod swapped his axe and manic grin for a pom-pom hat Yvonne, one of the ghost hunters, explains that therersquos nothing wrong with boisterous energy when searching for otherworldly entities. High spirits can persuade other types of spirits to make contact.Like most of the professionals here tonight, Yvonne declines to allow me to use her surname in print. She doesnrsquot want daylight acquaintances knowing her night time occupation.For all that, shersquos an earthy sort, with nothing remotely mysterious or ethereal about her personality.ldquoShout out to the spiritsyou want, she tells me. ldquoDonrsquot worry about sounding like a bit of a tool.Another ghost hunter, Eva, agrees. ldquoThink of tonight like a party, she says. ldquoYoursquove got to be single and ready to mingle. If you just stand in a corner, quiet and shy, the spirits wonrsquot be energised enough to make contact.Chapter : Of Witches, Maidens And Dastardly MonksSo our group does its best to encourage ghosts, ghoulies and other ghastlies to get in touch. Wersquore asked to briskly rub our hands together, to build up energy in the room. We also shout out questions to the invisible spirits surrounding us.ldquoWe are your friends, says David. ldquoWe have as much to learn from you, as you do from us.Little rubber balls are placed on the floor. Theyrsquore called kitten balls, rather incongruously, and when they are moved, they strobe flashing lights, like s disco balls.Shouting out questions, we encourage the spirits to answer us by shting these little balls.Occasionally a flash of light does spark through the darkness, indicating the balls are on the go. Conclusive evidence ghosts exist  Irsquom not convinced. Most likely itrsquos evidence wersquore standing in a drafty old house with rickety floorboards, where rubber balls are apt to wobble.We try a iety of other gizmos and gadgets to get in touch with the other side.An Ouija board. No luck.Then a contraption that emits strange screeches and crackles. Voices from the other side or radio interference Once again, Irsquom not persuaded.A red light is used to illuminate the faces of ious members of our group. If those faces morph into something dferent, it means a spirit is standing in front of that person. And, yes, faces do change. Sort of. Though only because the light teases shadows from the contours of noses, foreheads and mouths.The two spiritualists in our group spot more uncanny happenings. Ghosts of small children brush past, telling tales of a drowning in a pond. A hanged man swings from a banister. A pentagram on the kitchen flagstones marks the spot where a witch once worshipped. Nearby a wretched maiden was groped by a gang of dastardly monks.I glimpse none of this, however. Only the mediums see all.Julia Girdwood, whorsquos in charge of the evening, tells me events arenrsquot always dramatic, scary or opinion-shting when it comes to believingin ghosts.ldquoWe donrsquot fake anything, she says. ldquoWhich means the nights y. People sometimes come away a bit disappointed when things are quiet. Or they have a genuine uncanny experience.Speaking of which, did I come to believe, at nightrsquos end, that Provan Hall is haunted Irsquom afraid that, although I enjoyed the evening , I left forming a conclusion familiar to many a courthouse jury.

Despite the objection of the Democratic Unionist Partyand anti-abortion crusaders, it was ruled that from midnight it would be legal to have an abortion in Northern Ireland, as in the Republic of Ireland, as in the rest of the UK.With the passage of this legislation, women in the first  weeks of pregnancy who wish to have a termination will no longer have to skulk out of the country, or purchase online pills, rendering them open to prosecution should these make them so unwell they require medical attention.After next April, following an interim period during which access to services on the mainland will be freely available, the situation in Northern Ireland will change radically. Those who are pregnant as a result of incest or rape those who know their foetus has an incurable disease that will allow them little quality of le for as long as they survive those who have been told they must go full term, even though the baby has died, will finally be given a degree of dignity and comfort. At last, they will be able to end a pregnancy of their own volition, in their homeland, without stigma and with the full support of the medical professionals who tend to them.It is a not a subject for wild rejoicing, as was evident in the sombre response of campaigners on learning the law had been passed. The mood was more of relief than jubilation. Nobody can feel joy at the idea of a pregnancy that, for whatever reason, is better ended.But it is possible to feel gratitude that an old and crippling injustice, a hangover of a puritanical stranglehold on womenrsquos lives, has been overturned. As of now, Northern Irish women are entitled to decide on their own welfare and that of their unborn child. It is a right that is not only legal but ethical.That these new laws are among the most liberal in Europe is remarkable, given the strength and tenacity of opposition to this issue. It must exacerbate the fury of the anti-abortion camp to watch the political mothership in London impose its will with such vigour.That this has happened under a Conservative government with which the DUP was in partnership, is an added grievance. As is the fact that even the Republic of Ireland, once a by-word for religious conservatism, last year voted to allow terminations . This volte face was salt in the wound for pro-lers and pro-choice activists alike.The measure of how historic this landmark will prove can be gauged by the opening of the padlock on the Assemblyrsquos gates. Sinn Fein did not turn up, but Arlene Forster, leader of the DUP, announced that, despite this act, her party would explore ldquoevery possible legal option to prevent the provision of abortion services within their borders.A fuming zealot was less restrained: ldquoin todayrsquos world the most dangerous place to be is actually in the womb of a woman. There could hardly be a more calculated insult to womankind, but the depth of this manrsquos misogyny highlights the intensity of prejudice and oppression with which the pro-choice lobby has had to contend.This momentous step is good news for the United Kingdom, as is impending legislation to allow same-sex marriage from next January. All this is positive. Yet it is a sad day for the Union that both decisions, which will have far-reaching social implications, are not the work of Irish politicians but of Westminster.Since the Assembly collapsed in January , its day to day business has been handled by civil servants. You might argue they are doing such a good job they are enabling Sinn Fein and the DUP to maintain their stand-off. That not even the murder of the journalist Lyra McKee could encourage these parties to put aside their quarrel indicates the bitterness and ision at the heart of Irish politics.Yet while the Assembly has been lying all these months in an induced coma, London has not been idle. Those on the pro-choice side of the debate might have mixed feelings, since their argument has been vindicated thanks to action by the English. Time was when anything that came out of Westminster was regarded in certain quarters as toxic. How ironic, then, that the Assemblyrsquos denizens have allowed their internal wrangling, their myopia and obstinacy, to allow an often loathed overlord to step into their shoes and usher voters into a more compassionate age.That must be galling for everyone. Then again, perhaps not. When Stormont reconvened for the space of roughly an hour, squabbling made any hope of constitutional challenge impossible. It was hardly edying. Rather than acting as a reminder that the Assemblyrsquos members have the power to settle the countryrsquos affairs without interference from outside, it was instead a shambles, a pantomime whose script had been lted straight from the myth of Pandorarsquos Box.I would not be surprised , following this, some are wonderingthey should dispense with the Assembly altogether, since they are better served by panjandrums across the sea. Others, meanwhile, will be looking south towards the Republic, anticipating the time when old isions are lted, and all of Ireland is united peacefully once more.What lies between now and that day, should it ever arrive, will be turbulent, to say the least. For the meantime, it is paradox enough that it has taken Westminster to unlock the chains in which Northern Irelandrsquos women have been shackled. The symbolic signicance of this long overdue act should give the refusniks at Stormont pause for thought."},{"url":null,"title":"female-detectives-uncovering-scottish-arts-lost-women","story":"THAT Newhaven fishwe, the one with the tanned arms resting on her empty creel, head bent away aspreoccupied by something, until recently was one of the many women in the National Galleries of Scotland collections whose inidual lives we really knew little of.Mara Barth, project learning officer, scatters a collection of early photographs across a table and tells me that all these women are unknown. Itrsquos a feature not just of these images, but of many paintings and photographs of women in the National Galleries of Scotlandrsquos historic collections, and in many art collections across the world.Sometimes the only title these subjects get is ldquounknown woman, or \"four unknown women\". Sometimes it is ldquowe of, or ldquodaughter of. One sits on a motorbike. ldquoWe know a little bit about her, because we got curious and we liked her motorbike. We found out where this motorbike was registered, and it was in Morningside and we know that this was a type of bike designed for ladies.ldquoThere are a lot of female sitters in the collection, says Barth, ldquobut we often donrsquot know a lot about the sitters. This event is around exploring not just women artists but women sitters in the collection and specically around the Scottish collection. Wersquove drawn images from the early photography collection that are of unknown women. Nothing is known about any of these women. Or course in the early photography there is quite a lot of unknown men as well as women. This is a nice way to highlight some of the everyday women of Scotland. Early photographs were where we see them the most.Some of these anonymous women are at the centre of an event at the National Galleries Of Scotland titled, Where Are The Women  Itrsquos an interesting title, for, actually,you walk around any of our galleries, you do see plenty of women. There are nudes, classical goddesses, queens, ladies in their fine hats and gowns. But what feels absent too often is a sense of who some of these women really are. Thatrsquos particularly so when the women are working class.One of the inspirations behind this evening event is feminist author Sara Sheridanrsquos Where Are The Women : A Guide To An Imagined Scotland, which created a new map of the country, in which many of the statues of men that populate our streets were replaced by those to women or the roads renamed to memorialise women not men.ldquoIrsquom interested in the memorialisation of women, says Sheridan, who will speak at the National Galleries event, \"and when I wrote my book to remap Scotland, I discovered amazing things about our foremothers. We need to normalise womenrsquos achievement, we need to normalise womenrsquos voices and we need to normalise womenrsquos bodies as well. My book is one creative take on that.Sheridan acknowledges that in the National Galleries of Scotland the problem is not a blanket absence of women of the sort we see among the statues in our streets. Images of the female sex are plenty, though, in the historic collection, the vast majority of them are created by men. One of the problems is, though, she says, that these women are edited. An example she gives of this is the Victorian nudes.ldquoWhen we do see them theyrsquore not real people, theyrsquore statues. There is no body hair or anything like that and they all had these mad hairstyles. They were meant to look like statues and statues donrsquot have hair. The Victorians were inspired by statues from Greece and were painting women to look like that.She believes this editing of women is still relevant now. ldquoI founded Reek, a perfume company where when you wear the perfume you form a memorial to the women it commemorates. I want to talk about the way womenrsquos bodies are represented because thatrsquos something we care about at Reek. We donrsquot retouch images. We get a lot of complaints on Facebook becauseyou put up a lot of skin and nudes itrsquos taken down, and of course perfume photography is all about skin and nudes.The National Galleries of Scotland event is another take on the kind of memorialising of women that Sheridan does. It also reflects a kind of righting of a wrong, an attempt to uncover more ndash for instance more about that Newhaven fishwe, taken in .The image is iconic. Itrsquos one of which the early th century philosopher, Walter Benjamin, wrote, ldquoShe has something that canrsquot be silenced, something that fills you with an unruly desire to know what her name was, the woman that was alive there. The early th century philosopher happened to be looking at a copy of the photograph that had no name attached. Frequently the image was published, nameless, with other titles like ldquoNewhaven beauty or even ldquoNewhaven Madonna. Yet we do know the name of this young woman. its creators, Hill  Adamson, the first Scottish photography studio, did publish it, and, in the past few years, armed with that piece of information, the researcher and photographer Caroline Douglas has made it her mission to discover and understand this working-class woman, ElizabethHall, to bring her story to light.ldquoI really just wanted to build up a picture of Elizabeth Johnstone Hallrsquos le. There has been a lot of scholarship on Hill  Adamson, but it really struck me that there hadnrsquot been a great deal written about the iniduals, the unknown subjects, who sat for them. So my approach has really been from a dferent vantage point, the study of the history of photography from the perspective of the sitter, and very much so in this case, a working class sitter. I really think our understanding of the emergence of photography as a discipline changes when we begin to write these unknown figures into the history of the medium.These are some of the worldrsquos earliest photographic subjects, which is extraordinary in itself. And also they represent one of the first photo documentary series ever made. You have these living breathing subjects. And yet we still donrsquot know all that much about them.What do we now know  ldquoTherersquos a wedding band there on her finger, she says. ldquoShe was born Johnstone. And she married Daniel Hall and in the Scots tradition she kept both her maiden name and her married name. She was married but didnrsquot have any children. Sadly she died in relative poverty, though at quite an old age ndash in , the same year as Victoria died. They died within days of one another.One of the things she doesnrsquot know for sure is what awareness the subjects in these photos would have had of the circulation of the images. She also very much doubts that she would have been given a copy of the image, or invited on the occasions when they were exhibited. ldquoIn my research Ive learned that many of these iniduals werent literate. In the census records Ive been consulting, bold strokes or black marks where someone has been unable to sign their name.But one of the most fascinating things about her research into Johnstone Hall, is that it took a more personal twist when Douglasrsquos mother noticed a tweet about her research. She sent her a message, saying, ldquoCaroline, you know wersquove got both Johnston Halls and Listons [the name of a male subject in the photographs] in the family.ldquoIn my pursuit of trying to understand women in early photography, Irsquom finding Irsquom perhaps related to both the fishermen and women in the picture, she says.Douglas has an interest not just in the sitters ndash but also in the processes of early photography and the women who might have been involved in that. One thing she has been exploring is that there was a female technician on the Hill  Adamson project. There was also, she found, much further back, an Edinburgh woman who was key to developing some of the chemical processes that would lead to early photography. ldquoElizabeth Fulhame was doing chemistry experiments in Edinburgh in s, fty years before the founding fathers are deemed to have invented photography. And yet her work forms part of the bedrock of the invention of the medium. In the foreword of her book Fulhame writes, lsquoCensure is perhaps inevitable for some are so ignorant that they grow sullen and silent and are chilled with horror at the sight of anything that bears the semblance of learning ndash and should the spectre appear in the shape of a woman the pangs which she suffers are truly dismal.\"Itrsquos not an uncommon feeling, that desire expressed by Walter Benjamin to know more about the person featured in a portrait. Itrsquos one many visitors appear to feel around a popular painting in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Daniel Macneersquos A Lady In Grey.Gallery attendants have said they frequently are asked questions about this painting, long known to be a portrait of the artistrsquos daughter, Isabella Wiseman. ldquoYou look at her, says Freya Spoor, a curator at the National Galleries of Scotland, ldquoand want to know more. Yoursquore intrigued by her immediately. And she has a wonderful intimacy because they were father and daughter and I think they were very close. I think they had a similar sense of humour. Interested to uncover more, Spoor started looking into the object files and found that they also have two photographs of Isabella Wiseman donated by the descendants. ldquoOne has her in a similar post to Lady in Grey. She was an elderly lady at that point, sitting with her hands clapped in front of her.The photographs were given to the gallery by a descendent called Dr Ruth Wazzell, and she discovered that the family also had an archive at the National Library of Scotland. ldquoI was able to go and look at that. Lovely anecdotal information on her ndash about going to all the Royal Academy shows, going to the theatre. I think she had quite a keen sense of humour. You sort of felt like you were getting more of a personal picture of what Isabella was like.The Where Are The Women  event, while it does have a focus on sitters, is also about asking where women are in all areas of art production, and that includes the artists themselves. Spoor notes that there are gaps where they shouldnrsquot be. The reasons why womenrsquos works are missing are hugely ied. Artworks by Frances Maconald McNair, for instance are far fewer than they might be, because her husband, Herbert McNair, burned much of her studio work on her death. ldquoIt is a curious Victorian phenomenon to deal with grief, or it could be reputation-saving. But it happened quite regularly.Also doing a talk at one of the events are The History Girls, Rachael Purse and Karen Mailley-Watt. Their focus is ldquofriendship portraits, the paintings female artists have done of each other. She observes that when it comes to finding women in history, whether in written sources or art, where you have to look is in ldquothe gaps.ldquoWomen are often not mentioned at all, unless you look. For instanceyou look at the Chronicles of Charlemagnersquos rule some of his wives arenrsquot even mentioned by name but the children are mentioned so you have to guess who they are or where they are from by the mention of their children. You have to play detective because for a lot of history women are regarded as irrelevant so their names arenrsquot used a lot. Up until s, women became a legal nonentity upon marriage. Officially she didnrsquot exist. She wasnrsquot dead legally, but she wasnrsquot alive, she was just like an extra limb of her husband.Purse also notes that the lack of womenrsquos art prior to the th century is partly a reflection of the role they were expected to take in families. ldquoAs soon as they became pregnant or got married they were no longer able to practice art, and those that were able to do it up to that point were dependent on parents allowing them to do so and that generally meant only middle class people. The art that is produced by these women is just kept by the family usually. It doesnrsquot get sold and seen and written about by critics and collected by museums. Itrsquos in peoplersquos housesldquoWhat I find upsetting, she adds, ldquois that so many of these womenrsquos periods as artists are cut short by getting married or by a family, maybe theyrsquore unmarried but a father gets ill and theyrsquore the only unmarried daughter left so they have to stop then look after the household and their father. Itrsquos really sad when you see the abrupt stop.\"Frequently those artists who have risen to the kind of prominence that has seen their work in historical collections have not had children. One of these is Flora Macdonald Reid, an artist that Freya Spoor has recently researched. ldquoHer brother, Spoor says, ldquowas John Robertson Reid and her sister Lizzie was also an artist. She travelled extensively across Europe: France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and she incorporated exciting aspects which were reshaping art, rural naturalism. She was looking at rural people who were within the local area, real local flavour and presenting them in a really honest way. The muddy boots, the weather-beaten face.Macdonald Reid never married. ldquoI think, says Spoor, ldquothat was so she could focus on her art entirely. She dedicated her le to her artwork. She exhibited widely and in places where her work would have been seen on a par with men. She could command similar prices to her male counterparts.Of course, some very noteworthy female artists did have children and made motherhood the subject of some of their work. In Romance, Cecile Walton, produced a post-birth self-portrait, in which she depicts herself partially undressed, in a pose reminiscent of Manetrsquos Olympia. She holds up her baby and peers as it. Her older child plays at her feet.As Spoor puts it, ldquoItrsquos quite inquiring of motherhood generally. I think she was quite perplexed by this new child and what the future held for her. Itrsquos very honest in that way and itrsquos extremely relevant for themes today. She was mirroring other artistic tropes so you could say like Manetrsquos Olympia and further back to Titianrsquos Venus of Urbino. Itrsquos extremely honest and frank and I think it was considered quite shocking at the time.\"The Where Are The Women  event is part of a process of uncovering, of bringing women into the light. Researchers are gradually revealing that the female artist was not quite the rare beast that is often made out ndash but that unearthing her takes hard work. They are like detectives seeking out the women in art.ldquoIf itrsquos not one of the big names like Margaret Macdonald, or Phoebe Anna Traquair or Jessie M King, says Rachael Purse, ldquothe names wersquove heard of, then it become dficult. So you have to have a passion. I love Margaret Macdonald Macintosh and Joan Eardley, but they didnrsquot exist in a vacuum. These other people existed. Shocker.

For many undecided Scottish voters this sort of alternative appears to appeal ndash it avoids the big leap while still rejecting arrangements as they are today.But federalisation or any form of a signicantly re-imagined UK is never going to happen. My experiences as an undergraduate at Oxford taught me at least that much. The English elite simply have no interest in a radical reform. While the discourse along this theme rages on north of the Border, the silence in the south-east of England roars a definitive ldquono. Sweeping reform simply isnrsquot on the radar. Andit werenrsquot after a heartfelt vow to change was made on the eve of the  poll and % still voted Yes, it is never going to be.:Lobby row Ruth Davidson set up her own consultancy firm  days agoBecause in a ldquoprecious union of nations, as the nauseatingly insincere phrase goes, we would have said that given two nations rejected Brexit and the overall result in that referendum was narrow, we should leave but in a very soft form. A Union that respects the views of all its nations would allow for flexible arrangements where Scotland could have a deal tailored to its needs and respecting its anti-Brexit vote. But no such recognition of national dferences within the UK came Scotlandrsquos way. On Wednesday we even heard from the Prime Minister that the devolved legislatures have no role whatsoever in consenting to the Brexit deal ndash a claim as outrageous as it is erroneous.For most of the southern English who go on to rule the UK roost, Scotland piques interest only for carefully selected performative acts. At Oxford the usual crowd of boys schooled in England with refined English accents and London homes would don their kilts for formal dinners and balls. Burns Night is one such favoured occasion of the Scottish-when-it-suits-me cohort. And then therersquos the annual English middle-class pilgrimage to Edinburgh for the Fringe.Scotland deserves better than the disregard the English demonstrate the rest of the year.As much as our Westminster leaders profess their deep love of the Union, it feels much more like a love of the cultural prestige Scotland affords England and a fear of the symbolic blow to the UK that would come with independence.Better to look at what the UK Government does in relation to Scotland than continue to listen to the endless stream of verbal assurances insisting they care.I do believe the English and Scots have broadly the same values. The talk of Scottish progressiveness has probably been somewhat overdone in a country which in my letime had a private postal ballot on whether to continue banning discussion of gay peoplersquos existence from schools. But that is irrelevant. Where the Scottish and English erge is in voting behaviour. If the UK had not ed a Conservative government driven by English votes in , there never would have been a Brexit referendum that no one outside a rabid fringe was calling for. If the English had voted like the Scottish in that referendum, we would not still potentially be just days away from a catastrophic No-Deal Brexit that no one said was on the cards. But here we are.:MPs could hold Boris Johnson hostage over Brexit dateVoting patterns matter more than the values professed in polling. Voting choices have put us in the dire straits the UK is in today. And a voting choice can extract Scotland from this vicious cycle of disappointment with a UK seemingly hell-bent on damaging not just Scots but everyone  in Britain too.In recent weeks the possibility of border controls between Scotland and England has been raised in the event of independence. Our borders are best when theyrsquore invisible. There is a group which shares that view and has demonstrated its commitment to it through action. Itrsquos the European Union. If controls appear at the Border with an independent Scotlandin the EU, it will only be because the English have chosen not to sign up to the European norm, not because Scotland, like the vast majority of Europe, will have chosen to do so.As an Englishman due tosouth of that Border in February, I can only hope the rest of the UK would re-assess the situation in light of the new realities of a post-independence world and join Scotland and Ireland back in the EU. The choice will be for the rest of the UK to make.I am by no means wedded to the idea of independence. Through serious reform Canada redefined itself after Quebec voted by less than . per cent against splitting off in . Itrsquos an outcome the Queacutebeacutecois seem happy with, as independence is no longer under serious discussion.

Elsewhere, pound. million will be handed to Aero Space Kinross to develop a year-round visitor attraction.The combined pound million was originally allocated to acquire the airfield at RM Condor, the Royal Marines base near Arbroath, before the Ministry of Defence announced it would retain it.Scotland Office minister Colin Clark said all the projects ldquowill make a real dference.He said: ldquoThrough the UK city region and growth deal programme we have committed more than pound. billion to city and growth deals across Scotland, helping to create tens of thousands of Scottish jobs in the years to come."},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-address-first-pro-independence-rally-fm","story":"The First Minister, who has been conspicuously absent from recent large marches organised by the All Under One banner group, will be the headline speaker at the Indyref event on Saturday, November .The rally, in Glasgowrsquos George Square, has been organised by the Heraldrsquos sister paper, The National.Ms Sturgeon has said she wants a second independence referendum in late , but has yet to explain what she will doWestminster refuses to give her the legal power to hold it.She told this monthsrsquos SNP conference in Aberdeen that she she would request the Section  order power from the UK Government by the end of this year, and said Indyref ldquomust happen in .She has ruled out a Catalan-style wildcat referendum or using an election to claim a renewed mandate.She told The National: ldquoIrsquom really looking forward to speaking at the #indyref rally in George Square next Saturday afternoon - and I hope people from all over the country will come together and make Scotlandrsquos voice heard.Meanwhile, the anti-independence Scotland in Union group seized on comments made by a former European Parliament president that the EU would be in no hurry to admit an independent Scotland.Martin Schulz told Newsnight on Thursday thatScotland left the UK, even to avoid Brexit, there would be a ldquovery long, very long debate, a hard debate, a very controversial one within the European Union.With violent unrest in Barcelona over the jailing of nine Catalan politicians who organised an independence referendum in , he said: ldquoI doubt that the Spanish government, and a majority of the Spanish parliament, is enthusiastic about access of countries who just separated from the integrity of the country to which they belong.Scotland in Union boss Pamela Nash said: ldquoContrary to SNP claims, EU membership for a separate Scotland would be far from straightforward, and could be vetoed from day one.

Bigger businesses, Mr McCallum admitted, have been squeezing him out.They are finding it easier to bulk import the extra supplies of vital components, like the bottles, corks and caps, that they need. Business groups describe a real toll on the confidence of smaller entrepreneurs.Mike Cherry, the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, this week warned his members had ldquobeen left hamstrung by uncertainty for the past three years.One of the big worries for businesses is whether they can get labour, including seasonal workers, from the EU.But the four million or so citizens of other European nations living in the UK have reason to be stressed.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon symbolically again told them they were welcome in Scotland. But Brexit has delivered a dferent message ndash one that has added to the stress.Those in favour of Brexit insisted we were supposed to take back control. Instead, for people like Mr McCallum and so many others, there is just an overwhelming sense that even before any deadline runs out, we have lost it.The United Kingdom yesterday lurched into yet another Brexit extension, the date of which is still to be decided, into yet another period of aching political, economic and constitutional uncertainty.For some this was just the prolonged death rattle of the British Union state, a last agony. For others, it was more like a dficult and protracted delivery for a new sovereignty outside the European Union, a rebirth. But forget the destination.It is the pain of the journey that is hurting, the mental pain. Why  Because people are telling us they canrsquot control what is happening. And because they simply donrsquot know what is happening.There is more: all of this angst and anxiety, this discord and dispute, this stress and strain, looks set to last right through the holiday season. As the nights turn darker quicker and the cold seeps in, there is talk of a December General Election, of politics over the turkey and trimmings.The wry jokes have started as coping mechanisms click in. Merry Brexmas, say some, and a happy No EU year  As is so often the case when we donrsquot feel right in ourselves, it is our friends who notice. And not just the bad gags. First, foreign observers have used the language of mental health to describe the Brexit process itself.ldquoBritain had gone mad, said the New York Times in the summer. ldquoThe cult of Brexit has driven the Tory party to go mad, said Internazionale in Italy. Aghast commentary does nothing to calm British nerves.Neither, say mental health experts, do headlines that stigmatise illness. Some outside are really starting to worry about us.Take Brian Hughes, of the National University of Ireland in Galway.ldquoWhile we may in Ireland laugh at the UK, it is very stressful for the people in the UK, the psychologist told the .ldquoIt has realconsequences for peoplersquos wellbeing and mental health. There are multiple major concerns you would have for a nation like the UK and its population.Anti-depressant prescriptions shot up  per cent in the month after the big Brexit vote. They are supposed to go down in the summer months.We are less than a week from the latest Brexit deadline. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would ldquodie in a ditch rather than stay in the EU beyond Halloween.And yet it looks like October  will pass and we will still be in the worldrsquos biggest and most successful trading bloc.Back in March, days out from a previous deadline, the Mental Health Foundation issued research showing Brexit had made % of people in Scotland feel powerless.Another % were angry, another % worried. Nearly one in five of us are highly stressed, according to the poll. Toni Giugliano, the foundationrsquos policy manager, said: ldquoFeelings of powerlessness or worry are linked to a higher risk of mental health problems. They may also exacerbate existing dficulties.ldquoWe know, from other examples worldwide, that an unstable political environment can potentially affect peoplersquos mental health.ldquoThe number of people who said they felt high levels of stress or problems sleeping is also a concern.Mr Giugliano was speaking in March. Six months on he added that little had changed, but underlined the stress was not being dispersed equally. Some of us are more affected than others: EU migrants or people in businesses that trade with the EU, or for projects that get funding from the EU.German-born Professor Tanja Bueltmann, of Northumbria University, studies migration and also campaigns for citizensrsquo rights.She said: ldquoFor EU citizens, Brexit is not a threat of something that might happen in the future: it has been their everyday le for over , days, no end in sight. There is a real human cost to living in limbo for such an extended period, with growing tangible evidence documenting the impact of this uncertainty.ldquoIn particular, the mental health of EU citizens is affected, impacts ranging from anxiety to depression and panic attacks.ldquoEspecially worrying, however, is the growing number of accounts that reveal EU citizens holding suicidal thoughts. This is the result too of many EU citizens finding themselves in a real crisis of identity and belonging. This was bound to happen: how are they meant to come to terms with the fact the place they consider their home chose to implement a system that forces them to apply to stay [rather than an automatic system as was promised] ldquoWhatever happens next, the impact Brexit has had on EU citizens has already been signicant and is likely to have longer-term negative consequences for their mental health and wellbeing.In Europe there are also British citizens who were bracing themselves again for the prospect of a no-deal Brexit as soon as next week.This summer a study found three out of four British parliamentarians were suffering from poor mental health stress and depression. One of its authors, Dan Poulter, a Tory MP who still works as an NHS psychiatrist, stressed the work was lonely.Speaking in July, he added: ldquoMPs are potentially at greater risk of developing mental health problems because of the nature of their work and because they work in a high-stress environment where there are many brickbats and not many bouquets.Brexit has not made things easier. An MP was murdered by an extremist during the EU campaign. Crowds of often aggressive campaigners have gathered outside Parliament.Abuse on social media is re. A huge poll this week found a majority of voters think violence towards MPs is a price worth paying to get the Brexit outcome they want.Even the research team behind the survey, at Edinburgh and Cardf universities, said they found the findings ldquogenuinely shocking.Hannah Bardell is one of the MPs who have spoken frankly about looking after themselves as Brexit eats into their ability to do normal politics.She said: ldquoThat job, which I love and which I signed up for ndash and for all the stress that comes with it ndash has had quite a profound impact on my mental health.An MP since , Ms Bardell catalogued the stresses being forced on politicians.ldquoThe dysal system at Westminster the relentless wall-to-wall nonsense of Brexit not being able to do our job the way we should be because Brexit is taking up so much energy. All of that is having an impact on people and parliamentarians of all parties.So far studies have focused on adults but the pain is rubbing off on their children. The Mental Health Foundation has advice: donrsquot bottle it up. ldquoHave an honest discussion with them, be truthful, give them facts, and allow plenty of time for questions, it says. ldquoRemember that small doses of real time news are helpful, but overexposure is not."},{"url":null,"title":"history-scottish-football-100-objects","story":"WITHIN minutes of visiting the Scottish Football Museum at Hampden, I sensed something was missing.

We were waiting for the results to come through. BBC Scotland reporter John Barnes is interviewing Dundee United chairman Jim McLean. McLean was trying to protect his manager Alex Smith, whose side were struggling and on a desperate run of form. The fans wanted blood, and McLean was the scapegoat. Few chants cut to the bone more effectively than the dreaded three-word killer, \"sack the board\". When the frustration got too much, McLean punched Barnes. He immediately apologised and stood down. McLean was a coach who almost took a provincial side to European glory. He went out with a bang though and Scottish football doesnrsquot forgivehellipForget UEFA Cup Finals and European Cup semis, he will always be remembered for punching a reporter.PARKING THE BUSAs Scotlands boss, Craig Levein looked at the beautul game and decided to suffocate it. Inspired by watching the mighty Barca play Ruban Kazan, Levein chose to ignore the wizardry of Messi and the elan of the Catalan giants, preferring instead to get excited by the must-not-lose-at-all costs plucky efforts of the Russians. Forget flare and flamboyancy, he decided to park the bus. Perhaps its something to consider when we employ future Scottish coaches. Levein, Gordon Strachan and currently Steve Clarke all seem to be intelligent guys with too much time to think about the game between International games.TRAFFIC CONETraffic cones have become something of a familiar mot in the cultural fabric of Glasgow. They are seldom used to help with traffic. They are used as hats for statues, goalposts and as a weapon. While at work with Partick Thistle, Chic Charnley was insulted by two neds and a devil dog. The neds he could take but the devil dog crossed the line. Being a professional, he invited them to come back once training was finished, to take up the offer of a square-go. They did. They brought the Maryhill tool which was au rigueur at the time, the samurai sword. Chic had a traffic cone he was carrying from training.

This was Scottish football at its ridiculous best, this was working-class tea lady taking on a millionaire. This was Blur v Oasis. Aggie quickly realised how it worked and in articles started to sound imbued by the spirit of Muhammad Ali meets Liam Gallagher. All from a milk jug. After a second altercation, Souness would quote the incident and the petty nature of the Scottish game for his move to Liverpool. But a milk jug though JINKY JOHNSTONErsquoS OARYou would expect a player with such balance, poise, and trickery would be quite the nautical whiz. The fact Jimmy Johnstone was steamboats and without oarlocks didnrsquot help. The inclusion of this infamous tale is more than just high jinks at sea, or to be more geographically specic, the Firth of Clyde. Forget the Coast Guard having to be called, being forced to face a baying press pack by Scotland manager Willie Ormond and then playing out of your skin against England a few days later. This story works on a bigger level. Here were ordinary men, flawed men, who did incredible things. But, despite their fame, they were still men of the people, they walked and lived among us. They werenrsquot like Ronaldo, Neymar or Messi, who are locked away and cosseted from scrutiny for fear of it being bad for PR.

Airdrie, my hometown team, were playing St Mirren. Paul Hawthorne, my pal, said his mum had been down the street and the BBC cameras were there. We were both at Broomfield for pm. It would be churlish to miss out on any of the build-up. Alex Ferguson had won the old First Division and was heading for the Premier League. Airdrie applauded them on the park. We decided to stand behind the side St Mirren were attacking, as this would improve our chances of seeing ourselves on TV. Just to make sure we would be spotted, we turned our Parkas inside out and there we were, bright and orange. Le was simpler, and happier then.

No one was happy with the signing. In , the journos would have been fumbling through a well-thumbed thesaurus. Available clicheacutes were scarce.

Thatrsquos the belief of agnosticism.Far from being wish-washy they are making a fight to create wedding, funeral, naming and other ceremonies that are ldquoinclusive, ldquopersonal and ldquonon-judgemental. Tibbitt says that its not important what she herself believes ndash which ultimately she sums up with the line, lsquoEverybody is rightrsquo. ldquoNor is it about what the organisation believes,\" she says, \"but about what the family or couple you are working with believe. I felt there should be something in place that is about people. I wanted to be part of a belief body that was more open-minded and collaborative.Up until now there has been no Agnostic organisation in the UK, though according to a  Eurostat Eurobarometer survey around  percent of people in the UK are agnostic and  percent atheist. Meanwhile, even amongst non-believers itrsquos not necessarily true that they have no belief in anything spiritual or supernatural. A Humanist Society of Scotland study found that  percent of Scots did not believe in le after death and  percent do not believe in angels. However, The Understanding Unbelief project at the University of Kent, this year published research into atheists and agnostics, which showed that amongst these groups most people had some sort of belief in the supernatural. Doubt, meanwhile, is not uncommon. Even the famous atheist, Richard Dawkins, once said that he was only \". out of seven\" sure of his atheist belief.Tibbitt considers most of the celebrant work she has done since  as having been about offering an \"agnostic choice\" to families and couples. She had begun to feel strongly that there should be an official place for families to go to have this kind of open minded and person-centred ceremony. Among the ceremonies that spurred her was when she was asked to be celebrant for the funeral of a friendrsquos husband who was dying of cancer. Malcolm Stewart, who had been diagnosed with appendiceal cancer several years previously, had been given only weeks to live. In his final days, Tibbitt spent many hours talking with him about his beliefs and what he would like his funeral to be.ldquoIt was just such an eye-opener. He was dying. He was facing his own mortality and actually he didnrsquot really know what he believed. It was a mixed bag of a few dferent things and there wasnrsquot anywhere for him to go. I think itrsquos important that therersquos somewhere that you can go. You know some of his beliefs were a bit contradictory. He thought there might be an afterle. He said, I hope there is. But he said, Irsquom also liking the idea of reincarnation. We all of us have these myriad complex beliefs. That doesnrsquot mean we donrsquot take comfort from themtheyrsquore contradictory or not written up in some book. What Tibbitt was struck by was the need for someone to listen non-judgmentally and acknowledge the persons beliefs.Gabe Stewart, Malcolmrsquos widow, recalls that her husband had ldquoa very wide set of interest and beliefs and feelings. ldquoWe wanted a service that would reflect that. He was a baptised Christian, went to a church of England boarding school. He is one of like so many people in society today in the West, who consider themselves spiritual but not religious. So he had an interest in some aspects of Hinduism, some aspects of Buddhism and we were looking for the kind of funeral that would reflect the kind of man he was. It was not, she observes, that they chose an agnostic funeral. ldquoItrsquos just that what we wanted happens to be an agnostic funeral.The team at Agnostic Scotland have also already conducted agnostic funerals, naming ceremonies, vow renewals and weddings, including one naming ceremony that \"incorporated a lot of Native American ritual, shamanism, very holistic, beautul\". They plan on offering orce ceremonies, retirements, adoption ceremonies, pet funerals - in fact, almost any le transition or moment that people might want to celebrate. They also want to run community connection gatherings, in which, as Linda Keys put it people are brought together through things \"like nature or the arts that might inspire all\".Might agnosticism in these toxic times be something we might want to cultivate a bit more in all areas of society and le  Richard Holloway, the former Episcopalian Bishop of Edinburgh who has long been open about his agnosticism, his religious doubt, describes himself as ldquoa practising but unbelieving Christian.ldquoMy own take, he says, ldquois that there is much we cannot absolutely know, and therefore a kind of reverent agnosticism is probably the most honest position. Itrsquos the kindest position, because it doesnrsquot prompt you to persecute other people. And we need that in politics as well. A friend of mine who was a reconciliation worker in situations of conflict used to say you donrsquot understand the other side until you can make their argument as good or better than they can. Only when yoursquore able to do that can you be in a position to do an honest but kindly opposition. And wersquore so fractured at the moment that we donrsquot do that.What he thinks we need to cultivate is a ldquoreverent openness towards each other. ldquoBe argumentative ndash because Scots are intrinsically argumentative ndash but in an open, generous kind of way. Somehow thatrsquos at a discount at the moment, and thatrsquos partly to do with all the social media stuff that gives us a way of hating anonymously. A lot of people sneer at each other. Social media seems to be a colossal bear pit of ugliness and hate. The world is now so interconnected that therersquos no separation. You canrsquot shut your door and get away from things. We could do ourselves in as a bloody specieswersquore not careful.The story of Agnostic Scotland says a great deal about the dogmatic nature of our culture, particularly here in Scotland. For, it has come into existence as an answer to a particular problem. The biggest humanist organisation in Scotland is essentially atheist and doesnt allow religious content in their ceremonies. Tibbitt trained with the Humanist Society Scotland, she recalls, thinking they were going to be non-dogmatic. But, in the process of doing her training, she realised that, ldquoIn Scotland ndash though it isnrsquot the same in England - the main humanist societies are mostly atheist so they are dogmatic. You canrsquot have certain things in the ceremonies. You cant have hymns.One of the more high-profile figures in the humanist movement in Scotland has been Tim Maguire. Maguire recently left to, to join Celebrate People, an organisation that describes themselves as ldquospiritual humanists, and which is happy with the inclusion of religious content. Gerrie Douglas-Scott, one of the co-founders of the organisation says that often people will say that they ldquoare a spiritual but not a religious person.Maguire acknowledges that he too is agnostic. I thinkwersquore honest none of us know anything, andwe have any humility we should all be agnostic. Atheism strikes me as unsupportable because itrsquos a certainty about something you cannot know about. For me it doesnrsquot matter. How you behave is much more important than what you believe.He is also, like Tibbitt, concerned by the fact that ldquothe largest Humanist organisation in Scotland is one that is resolutely atheist. The Humanist Society of Scotland , remains the largest single provider of religion or belief-based marriages, having overtaken the Church of Scotland in , and, on its website advises that religious content is not generally included in its ceremonies. ldquoThatrsquos not right, he says. ldquoIt certainly isnrsquot humanism as I recognise it.Maguire recalls having participated in a long-running internal debate in the HSS, in which he argued that people should be allowed to have religious content in their ceremonies as they do in England and Wales. On one occasion, he says, he asked Richard Holloway, why he thought there was this dference in humanist culture between Scotland and England. ldquoHe came up with a theory that it was because every new belief forms in opposition to the dominant belief of its time and place, so when humanism takes root in England itrsquos forming in opposition to the Anglican church, which is very nice and nobody would ever question you on your dogma. Itrsquos accepting and warm and fuzzy. Humanism in Scotland forms in opposition to Calvinism and Scots Catholicism.Holloway observes that the reason humanism has been so successful is because it has provided something we are missing. ldquoIt seems to me, he says, ldquowhat the humanists are doing is inventing the consolations of religion without the supernatural side of it. Which s quite interesting. The belief side of religion is less important than a lot of people think ndash itrsquos the christenings, itrsquos the funerals, itrsquos the weddings, itrsquos the marking of tragedy. The churches down in Essex today are all open so people can go and just be quiet as a result of these trafficked victims. Itrsquos deep in human nature, and I think that a lot of people who give up religion miss it, not so much missing God as missing the structures of consolation that are there for them at times of incurable need like that.It is, possible, of course to work as an independent celebrant, not attached to any belief body, but, as Tibbitt points out, when it comes to legal ceremonies like weddings, there is no legal recognition, which means that the couples then have to redo the paperwork One of the books that inspired her approach is was Alain De Bottonrsquos Religion For Atheists. ldquoHis book, she describes, ldquois not negative about religion. Itrsquos positive about religion. But itrsquos basically saying for those non-religious people, those people who donrsquot really know what they believe, religion has brought a lot of wonderful things and what we need in our society is a non-dogmatic alternative to religion that offers the same things. I think thatrsquos what the Humanists have been trying to do but itrsquos ended up being dogmatic. We wanted to try to create something that was non-dogmatic, collaborative, open-minded and still brings people together.Agnostic Scotlandrsquos Linda Keys considers that many peoplersquos beliefs are now quite nuanced, ldquopartly because they have so much information from dferent belief systems that itrsquos really hard to put it in a precise little box. She adds, ldquoIt seems asin politics we are becoming increasingly polar, but I think therersquos something around identity where wersquore starting to recognise that wersquore all on a spectrum. To me, belief can sit within that range of things where therersquos a spectrum, and also where we can be fluid.Agnosticism is something we might want to cultivate more in politics too. As Richard Holloway puts it, ldquoAgnosticism in religion is about the big ultimate question, is there a supernatural reality called God  I think that even in politics while itrsquos more empirical and down to earth and measurable, yoursquore still not sure what the particular outcome of a policy will be. Because there are always unintended consequences, which is why we have stumbled our way in democracy to this idea of loyal opposition that every policy must be loyally challenged from the other side. Otherwise you end up with strong-armed dictatorships that go only one way. And I think that agnosticism is a healthy part of democratic politics."},{"url":null,"title":"excellent response to call for new members","story":"Dozens of folk have signed up to become Bailies of Bennachie during the first half of October.The conservation group is having a push on membership this month with all new members being entered into a prize draw for a voucher for afternoon tea for two at Pittodrie House Hotel.The group’s outreach officer, Fiona Cormack, explained: “It is wonderful to have had such apositive response so far.“A social media campaign is featuring inidual Bailies saying why they are members.

These bus services are described as “commercial”.Local authorities such as Aberdeenshire Council have a duty to identy travel needs within their area which are not otherwise met, and secure what public transport is appropriate taking into account the funds available. These bus services are described as “supported”.In addition to funding fixed route bus services, the council supports community transport, for example dial-a-bus and voluntary car schemes operated by the voluntary sector, provides door-to-door dial-a-bus services and also provides a TaxiCard Scheme which offers a discount on taxi fares, usually £ per journey, for older and disabled residents.Chair of the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee, Councillor Peter Argyle, said: “It was agreed earlier this year that the network should be reassessed by means of a ‘clean-sheet’ approach, in order to identy a more sustainable network in the longer term that will more effectively cater for otherwise unmet travel needs, assist in addressing patronage decline and provide better value for money.“I would encourage all those who currently use bus services or may require them in the future to complete this quick survey which will provide vital information for our wider consultation.”Vice-chair Councillor John Cox added: “In addition to getting the views of residents, our survey is being issued to a wide range of organisations including community councils, rural partnerships, schools and social care facilities.“That feedback will assist us in developing cost-effective, fit-for-purpose services for Aberdeenshire communities in the years to come.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Here are  of the strangest UK parking laws to be aware of to ensure you avoid being fined by authorities\"   of the strangest UK parking laws viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Further information on the council’s strategy and associated current policies for the support of passenger transport including local bus services, can be found in the Passenger Transport Strategy https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk media  passengertransportstrategy.pdfThe questionnaire will be available online from Monday, October  to Monday, December  at https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk roads-and-travel public-transport policies-strategies-and-contracts Printed copies being available in local libraries, Aberdeenshire Council offices, Ellon Park  Ride, and Peterhead Interchange, with effect from November ."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmThe spoils were shared in a pulsating eight-goal thriller between Orkney FC and Golspie Sutherland in Dounby this afternoon.

The new agreement has been criticised by commentators for undermining the links between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Speaking in the house yesterday, Mr Carmichael asked: “The creation of a customs border down the Irish Sea and the necessary declarations as a consequence of that is something about which Ruth Davidson and the former Secretary of State for Scotland warned last year.#They said then, and it’s true now, that it will undermine the Union. Why is the Secretary of State disregarding his Rt Hon Friend’s advice ”Responding in the house, the secretary of state said: “This is a deal that protects the border, this was a key priority for me as Secretary of State. It protects the peace process. The economy of Northern Ireland, I think, will benefit from this deal . . . and I would work over the implementation period to minimise any problems for Northern Ireland businesses in exporting and selling into Great Britain.”Responding after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The Secretary of State’s response was muddled and confused. It shows once again that the Conservative Party is now so fixated with Brexit that it is blind to the damage that they risk doing to the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The lack of concern shown by the Government about this issue is deeply concerning.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This scheme will include looking at prehistoric seafaring and what the Isles were like thousands of years ago, what travel would have been like between the isles with very dferent sea levels. Shipwrecks will also be considered — uncovering more information about wrecks around the isles, looking at any that might still be unrecorded and sharing anecdotes and stories passed down through families and between friends. One aspect of the project will look at maritime cultural landscapes and how sea links and industries have shaped the character of each isle. Maritime art will also be explored in more detail in each island including the possibility of creating an art exhibition or trail that is inspired by the maritime nature of the isles.   Andy Golightly, programme manager for the North Isles Landscape Partnership said: “If people get involved in this project as well as the opportunity to find out more about maritime history and perhaps add to the existing research there will be the chance to learn new and interesting skills including surveying, mapping and even expanding their creative and artistic abilities too”     Natalia Bain from Wessex Archaeology added: “We have arranged a series of information events across isles so people can find out more about the project, the opportunities for involvement and what they would like to research.” Information sessions about the project will be held throughout next week. This includes events at Sanday Community School on Monday, October  Westray Junior High on Tuesday, October  St Ann#s Community Room in Papa Westray on Wednesday, October  Eday Heritage Centre on Thursday, October  North Ronaldsay Community Centre on Friday, November  and at the Boathouse in Shapinsay on Saturday, November .Dates in Stronsay and Rousay, Eglisay and Wyre are to be confirmed.For further information, you can contact the North Isles Landscape Partnership Scheme via its Facebook Page.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This further three month delay is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland needed, given the ongoing uncertainty it creates.“It seems that every time Ministers make an announcement the deadline for the new contract gets pushed back.

So what better time to test the health of this -year-old Edinburgh institution I begin my journey outside number one Princes Street. The Balmoral stands sentry at the east end and looks as good as ever but I’m on the wrong side of the tracks and across the road the problems begin.Things start well with the Apple Store, a shining example of the need to create a shopping experience to counteract Amazon but a couple of doors down come the phone shops and the first empty site. Outside discarded fast-food detritus blows in the breeze.: The best views in Britain  Edinburgh’s Royal club to become luxury destination: Poundland issue ‘vote of confidence’ for future of Edinburgh’s ailing Princes StreetHeading west is the first great reminder of past Princes Street. At street level only a few inscriptions evoke memories of the old RW Forsyth department store but look up and architectural brilliance is everywhere.A few steps further brings a tartan tat store – all of which promote what no Scot wants Scotland to be. Then the first of the modern blocks on Princes Street. Dull, al and uninviting.Brutalist architectureBut hang on, next it’s Jenners. The window posters may scream  per cent off but it remains the grande dame of Princes Street. Sadly, nowadays its main purpose seems to be as somewhere to get out of the rain.Back outside and past another couple of phone shops and the giant Marks and Spencer, the old BHS site is being redeveloped into a Premier Inn with ground-floor retailanyone is brave enough to take it on.Next comes the New Club and some shoe shops, this brutalist central block a proper carbuncle on the face of Princes Street. I pause at the door of World of Sweets, a retail celebration of our obesity crisis but carry on to the last surviving example of Princes Street as it once was. Except it’s gone. The Hector Russell kiltshop preserved much of the original  Princes Street but a coffee chain has now taken over the building. I’m too disappointed to look inside.Instead I cross Hanover Street and pass the boarded-up Royal Overseas League, some of the giant stores about to relocate to the St James and what will soon be Poundland. Then the curious site of three phone shops in a row, all flogging the same technology and the same deliberately confusing tarfs. Then it’s the end of the road,  Princes Street, currently taking shape as a £m Johnnie Walker Whisky Experience. I stop and look back.It wasn’t as bad as I’d expected and the street is still busy but the worst is yet to come when the big department stores close, as close they will in the next few years.The solution for Princes Street has to be dferent. We are so fixated with the state of the shops we forget the view.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government. Ultimately, it is Health Secretary Jeane Freeman who has the power to stop this. Hopefully, she#ll use it before Stornoway wrecks a system that has worked well for decades."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MOD-GLW-19-GOLD-MEDAL-1.jpg","title":"both of this years gold medals are won by glasgow","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAfter  years living in the city, Claire and family were due to move back to her native Ness in Lewis on Monday.The -year-old teacher had previously won the Traditional Gold when the mòd was in Stornoway in .

Is it a bird  Is it a plane  No, it’s a hawk-shaped kite designed to scare away seagulls and other sky-borne nuisances. Graciously circling overhead like birds of prey on the hunt, two faux hawks are simply attached to a line and pole, which is mounted to the roof of the fast food restaurant, rising and falling with every change in the wind. Passers-by could be forgiven for being startled when the kite is whipped into action by a gentle breeze that helps keep the seagulls at bay . Historically, seagulls have lived near the sea or sometimes beside rivers and reservoirs, but they have increasingly been found in inland towns and cities where they are often viewed as pests by the urban population.The problem is made worse by the fact that the main culprit is the herring gull – one of the largest and most aggressive members of the gull family on the island of Ireland.One reason for the growth in the number of gulls is the relative safety for the birds of perches atop man-made structures, where gulls commonly build their nests out of the reach of predators.Another reasons that gulls have moved inland is the abundant supply of food waste, which helps sustain them. No surprise, then, that they might flock to supermarkets, shops and food outlets like McDonald’s.While retailers, local government authorities, and restaurants have been keen to limit the birds’ access to food waste by using lidded bins and encouraging proper disposal, the urban gull perseveres. The daring and intelligent birds have been known to swoop down on humans to snatch food from their hands – an obvious danger when you’re trying to eat a Big Mac. While the law makes it illegal to recklessly injure or kill any gull or damage or destroy an active nest or its contents, it does, in the interest of health and safety, make allowances for certain control measures, and there are few more clever – or more humane – than the kite hawk. The urban gulls have been the subject of human concern leading, in some cases, to lethal methods of control. However, given that they are a red-list threatened species, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds questions the use of lethal control as a means of dealing with the issue.A less aggressive method of control – like that employed by McDonald’s at Westwoods – is just one solution that may help our co-habitation. At the very least, your McNuggets are somewhat safer."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bmg-advert-banner-classified-v01.png","title":"welsh fm%e2%80%88calls for bridge building at belfast","story":"THE First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford AM was in Belfast on Friday when he appealed for bridge-building across the Irish Sea despite the headwinds of Brexit.The Welsh premier made the appeal at the gala banquet of the Belfast International Homecoming in City Hall.He also said he was envious of the strong global Irish American networks – which were represented at the three day Homecoming event which showcased the best of Belfast to the Irish diaspora.Mr Drakeford praised the “well organised diaspora” of Ireland and Scotland for promoting their country’s “practical interests around the globe”, but called for better self-organisation to protect Welsh interests in the context of Brexit.“There are Welsh people, too, around the world,” he said.“They are just as passionate about their identity and the home from which they have sprung – but they don’t yet operate in that organised way we see in this room.“For us, that means we have to work harder – and harder still in the headwinds of Brexit – to sustain our profile and our unique identity on the international stage. Since I became First Minister, in December last year, we have an International Relations Minister in our Cabinet – an idea completely unthinkeable at the start of devolution. We have a highly regarded International Strategy, which is being discussed and debated across Wales.”Mr Drakeford stressed the importance of forging links between people on “dferent sides of the Irish Sea”, particularly those from “Celtic nations”.“Amongst us all are links of language, of history, of culture, of economic identity and, in many instances of progressive political outlook,” he said.“We all share the presence of a powerful neighbour, with a global and dominant language and a well-developed sense of its own signicance. In the Brexit context – and beyond it too – we have had the best results, I believe, when we have been able to work together, in an informal Celtic alliance, to provide a more powerful counterweight to hard line leave propositions than we could have mobilised working on our own.“And in the dficult days ahead, I think the effort to identy common interests, to act with a sense of solidarity in their pursuit, and to create outcomes which work for us all – that effort will be needed as never before.”"},{"url":null,"title":"european union free to promote irish unity sinn fein mep claims","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The remainderwas spent on legal fees.With an average wait of . years to resolve a claim, there was a total of , cases open at any one time in this -month period.These cases have so far racked up a bill of £m, including £m on legal costs.Over the period,  new cases were opened,  were closed while , cases remained open and  were settled.The annual spend has dropped by £.m compared to  , but the amount of cases open at any time has increased by nearly .Former DUP Health Minister Edwin Poots said that while many cases were genuine, too many patients are being encouraged to start unnecessary claims against health trusts.Sinn Fein MLA Pat Sheehan added that in some cases a lack of transparency from health authorities over mistakes had also added to the costs.The report, published yesterday, defines negligence as \"a breach of duty of care by members of the health and social care professions employed byorganisations or by others consequent on decisions or judgments made by members of those professions acting in the course of their employment, and which are admitted as negligent by the employer or determined as such through the legal process\".The cost for   broken down by area was:Belfast Trust - £,,.Legacy HSS Boards - £,,.Western Trust - £,,.Southern Trust - £,,.Northern Trust - £,,.South Eastern Trust - £,,.NI Ambulance Blood Transfusion Service - £,.Over half of casesopen in   related to four specialities. Those were: Obstetrics , Accident and Emergency , General Surgeryand Trauma and Orthopaedics .Mr Poots said all claims need to be scrutinised.\"There is a culture out there to make claims from health trusts and theres companies that specialise in it and advertise,\" he said.\"That includes cold calling people to do this. This is a major problem for health providers everywhere.\"Mr Poots said it was still important to recognise genuine claims where \"catastrophic harm has been done\".\"I know that I received a phone call one day from a solicitor askingI wanted to claim for bad treatment I received in hospital,\" he said.\"I absolutely devoured them on the phone, but there are some people taking them up on the offer.\"That is a problem that exists today. I always encouraged the trusts to settle things quickly to avoid and to not allow legal fees to pile up.\"Mr Sheehan, a Sinn Fein MLA for West Belfast, said that efforts to address mistakes had not always been patient-centred, with a lack of transparency from health authorities making things worse in some cases.\"Often the emotional impact and trauma experienced by patients is greatest where health authorities have failed to accept their mistakes,\" he said.\"The HSC system must work towards a culture of openness and accountability.\"Negligence shouldnt be understood exclusively as a financial cost to the health budget but in terms of the value we place on an open and transparent health and social care system.\"A Department of Health spokesperson said: \"Budgetary provision is made each year for clinical negligence costs.\"The reality is that clinical negligence expenditure fluctuates each year.

I said so at the time.“Because you can’t use the threat of violence to achieve something.“And that unfortunately now has set a precedent where people from loyalism are looking at that, and they’re saying ‘hold on a second, he used that in that particular way, so now we’re going to use that’.“That’s wrong. That is not the way forward.”Ms Foster said loyalist concerns about the Brexit deal were understandable.“I am not dismissing, and I want to be very clear on this, fears and concerns of the loyalist community, or indeed unionist middle class people, or anybody in unionism at the moment, because actually unionism and loyalism are all at one relation to this deal – they are rejecting it,” she said.“So instead of talking about loyalist violence in relation to that, let’s deal with those fears.“And let’s deal with those concerns in a way that addresses them.“And the way to do that, of course, is to try and deal with those issues aroundconsent and the concerns that we have around customs.”In response to Ms Foster’s remarks, a spokesman for the Taoiseach said: “The Irish Government is a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.“Protecting peace on the island of Ireland has and always will be our overriding objective.“It should be clear to everyone that Brexit itself has disturbed the political equilibrium in Northern Ireland.“It’s the main reason why the Irish Government was against it.“We have never wanted any new borders neither North-South nor in the Irish Sea.“Unfortunately, leaving the EU customs union and single market requires that checks must now happen somewhere.”"},{"url":null,"title":"foster insists resolution to impasse over irish language can be found","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We know that Northern Ireland works best when we work together.“And to get a deal to bring Stormont back, there will need to be an agreement that we all can support.“I’ve already committed more than two years ago to seek accommodation and to legislate in a balanced way for language and culture, including for the Irish language.“Unfortunately we have had too many painful experiences of the manner in which councils particularly in the West have sought to implement Irish language policies.“But we recognise there are many in Northern Ireland who love the Irish language and for whom it is an intrinsic part of who they are.“So, my offer stands. If we can find a way to craft language and culture laws that facilitates those who speak the language, but does not inappropriately infringe on or threaten others, the DUP will not be found wanting.“But overall agreement needs to be a two-way street.“In particular, the DUP wants to see mechanisms to cultivate and grow relationships between Northern Ireland and Great Britain through all walks of le, including educational and cultural connections.“AndStormont is to be restored on a long-term basis that means sharing the responsibility of a fair deal. No winners or losers, everyone putting their best foot forward to provide a brighter future for all.”Ms Foster devoted a signicant section of her speech to issues of identity and culture.She said unionism needed to be “inclusive, welcoming and embracing to all”.“It should permit iniduals to express the cultural le they choose,” she said. “Whilst many focus on Ulster-Scots and Unionism, let me be clear, it is not incompatible to be an Irish language speaker and a Unionist – indeed there might even be one or two here today.”At that point, the big screen on the conference stage panned onto DUP MP Gregory Campbell, who once faced an Assembly ban for refusing to apologise for parodying the language during a sitting of the legislature. Ms Foster continued: “Because the backgrounds of Unionists are many and ied, Unionism should have many portals, and multiple gateways in.“The inescapable fact remains that people value Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom for a wide range of economic, social, historic and cultural reasons.“Culture can play a big part in our identity and who we are.“Too often though in Northern Ireland, culture has been demeaned and demonised, or proven detrimental to progress here.“Northern Ireland is rich in dferent cultures, and we need to embrace and cherish them in a manner that threatens no one.“Those who seek to engage in a cultural war engage in a zero-sum battle. Northern Ireland is big enough to accommodate everyone’s culture. Indeed as unionists, it is in our long-term strategic interests to ensure that everyone, regardless of their culture, feels at home in Northern Ireland.“That is why in the talks with other Northern Ireland parties we have proposed principles around cultural expression and identity that can harness and develop all that is good about these pursuits.“And we must use them as a force for good to educate, and help give people confidence and develop as iniduals.“We are so much more than two traditions in Northern Ireland now, and we need to give our new identities space to grow and prosper too.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland public goes wild for bears and wolves roaming free at sanctuary in donegal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They were kept in a concrete cell with iron bars and their feet had never touched the earth, nor had they ever been able to enjoy a swim, which is something bears in their natural habitat love,\" he said.\"We brought these three bears, who are all from the one family, here and it was a sight to behold when we released them into the habitat we created for them here.\"They took tentative steps onto the earth two weeks ago and on Thursday the large male took a swim and went into the water for the first time ever.\"It was actually quite emotional because he went out of his depth and panicked, but his natural instincts soon kicked in.\"Mr McLaughlin, whose day job is a solicitor, hopes to add to Wild Irelands collection.However, he still believes the sight of wild animals roaming the land, as happened in a bygone age, is unlikely to happen any time soon.He said: \"The animals we have are all rescued animals and we hope to bring other rescued animals here, but they would have to remain in this sanctuary because it just is not possible to reintroduce them to their natural habitat.\"If we want to reintroduce them we would have to link up all of our national parks with corridors of forest and wilderness - they would need that level of space to roam, but I think realistically we are hundreds of years away from that,\" Mr McLaughlin addedWild Ireland is now open to the public with all entrance fees going to the running costs of the sanctuary."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The delay is due to issues relating to routine testing of the Fluenz Tetra nasal flu vaccine by the manufacturer and is not related to the safety or the efficacy of the vaccine. Work is under way to minimise potential disruption to the childhood flu immunisation programme in the Northcaused by this. In line with the rest of the UK the Chief Medical Officer has requested GP’s prioritise children with underlying health conditions and pre-schoolers over the age of two. googletag.cmd.push Dr Gerry Waldron, Assistant Director of Public Healthat the PHA, said: “We have been exploring how to best use the available stock based on evidence and clinical advice, and taking into account projections on the revised delivery schedule to maximise protection in the community. “Practices will continue to offer the vaccine to pre-schoolers and children in at risk groups as normal. The school vaccination programme is currently continuing as normal. Pupils at special schools have already received their vaccine. “However, the disruption to supply may lead to vaccinations in some primary schools being rescheduled, but all eligible children will have an opportunity to receive their vaccine. “Whilst this situation is unfortunate, it is completely outside our control and we would continue to urge eligible people to get vaccinated, as we know this is the best way to protect against the flu. Parents of at-risk children and pre-schoolers should make themselves aware of their own GP surgery’s flu vaccination arrangements.” This issue does not impact on the adult flu vaccination programme, and we encourage all adults who are eligible to receive the flu vaccine to get it. This will not only help to protect them, but will also help to reduce the impact of flu in the wider community.

These sides are no strangers to each other and it is a game that features two of the outstanding underage teams in the country over the past few years having clashed with each other in the last two All Ireland Feacuteile finals, Burren winning the  Feile and Magherafelt gaining revenge in the final of the  Feacuteile. Both teams are no strangers to the Paul McGirr tournament either with Burren’s latest visit being last year where they were defeated narrowly in the semi final by Lavey, they have fonder memories of the tournament however from  when they won it with a team from which many of the players have already progressed onto their senior team which won last year’s Down title. googletag.cmd.push This season Burren’s success has continued having blitzed their way through the Down league and championship culminating in a - to - victory over Bredagh in the championship final. With  of their starting team from last year’s Paul McGirr campaign there is no doubt that Burren are the team to beat this year. James Kelly, Patrick McCarthy and Ryan Magill backbone a talented defence, Odhran Murdock and Conlin Bradley will be looking to dominate proceedings in midfield while up front James Duggan, Zach Murdock and Eoin Loughran are all noted score getters. However their talisman Niall Toner is the man the Derry champions will really have to look out for, his displays in the tournament last year were breathtaking to say the least and there is no doubt he will have a major bearing on the contest. Lead coach Neil Coulter feels his preparations have been hindered somewhat but is looking forward to the occasion ‘Burren are delighted to be once again representing Down in this year’s Paul McGirr Ulster Tournament, preparations have been tough going as  of our players were involved with the minor’s in last Sunday’s championship final replay so getting them together this past few weeks hasn’t been easy, however we are really looking forward to Saturday’s game against Magherafelt, it is a repeat of the Feacuteile finals and will be a really tough battle.’ Magherafelt are a club that’s riding on a crest of a wave at the minute with this week being one of the most memorable in the south Derry club’s history, adding the Derry U title to their historic senior victory last weekend. Wednesday evenings - to - victory over a fancied Lavey in wet and windy conditions was met with great euphoria and Enda Qunn’s men will be looking to take that momentum into Saturday’s fixture. They won’t have had much time to recover but they are a side laced with quality, Luke McCann and Eoin McEvoy the fulcrum of a solid defence with McCann likely being given the unenviable task of keeping tabs on Toner. Cormac Bateson and Dan Higgins form a very solid midfield partnership and up front they have their own talisman in Daragh Wade who was part of last season’s Derry minor . This game has the potential to be one of the best in the long history of the Paul McGirr tournament and no doubt both clubs will bring a huge support with them for the fixture. It is an intriguing match up with both sides being used to success and being very familiar with each other. Magherafelt will definitely not be ring rusty but may feel the effects of their draining battle with Lavey on Wednesday night. The hurt of having lost out to Lavey in last years semi final should give Burren that bit of an extra incentive and this could well tip the scales in their favour, either way whoever emerges from the tie will be favourites to annex the  Paul McGirr title.

We must’ve had a least a  minute phone-call with him saying ‘you’re doing nets’ and me saying ‘no’ but sure look where I am at now and I’m happy about it,” the imposing Magherafelt custodian utters with a smile. “I’ll take it.”For the last two weeks, Barry Gillis worked intently with Lynch ahead of the biggest day in the clubs history for  years.He kicked ball through the eye of a needle almost and made himself impassable when an Ethan Doherty goal would’ve opened a four point lead in the first-half.As well as that, his handling was impeccable as stray, wind-assisted balls dropped in on top of him in the second-half.How does a young player deal with pressure “You expect the pressure, that’s what comes from being in nets. If somebody outfield drops the ball, somebody  picks it up. If I drop the ball, it’s a goal. You saw it yourself a few games ago . I have played in a few big games but nothing like this. In the big games, you know what to expect.”At one point in the second-half he took off on a foray into the midfield zone. It’s impossible to clip his wings all the time.“You play with a bit of freedom as well. I get to go on wee runs but they don’t want too many of them. You’re the th man and whenever everyone  is wrecked out the pitch, you are fresh and get to go.”Lynch comes into the senior setup with a contingent of their U winning team and they have fitted like a glove.There is a buzz in the camp and their celebrations, with their tops off, in a local hostelry after their win over Coleraine only galvanised them.“They have been off ever since,” Lynch joked.The togetherness has been fostered by the management team.“It is a great squad to be part of,” he adds. “Cush, Baggio , QBand Tomare very involved. They are close together.”There is another attraction in the senior camp for Lynch. The chance to play alongside those he looked up to.“Danny , Chief – I grew up beside Jared and grew up watching him and that’s what you want to be, now I have the chance to play beside him.“Joe Keenan retired four years ago, took two years out and now he is back flying fit and came on there today. It’s great to get a chance to play with the boys you looked up to.”The Rossa ‘keeper jersey is in safe hands. googletag.cmd.push   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sean O’Connor moved on to Armstrong to shut down his threat, while Marty Donaghy’s influence waned after he sustained an arm injury.In contrast, Foreglen only grew in confidence as time ticked on, with Mark McCormick and Kevin O’Connor clinical from the dead ball, while Ciaran McFeely made a huge impact off the bench. googletag.cmd.push BREATHLESSClaudy made two changes to their listed team, with Callum McElhinney in at full-back for Cory Armstrong – tasked with picking up Kevin O’Connor – while Conall White was in for the injured Shane McGahon, acting as the sweeper alongside Stephen Farren and pushing Paddy Hargan into midfield on Mark McCormick alongside Eoin McGahon.Caolaacuten and Cahir O’Connor were the men inside for Foreglen, watched by Fionain Smyth and Jamie Brown respectively, and it allowed Kevin to pull out and create the space with his movement.Conor Johnston squared up to Kevy Dunne, but also acted as the plug in the centre of defence alongside McGahon to stop Oisin Duffy’s runs from deep – with Marty Donaghy pulling out onto the ’ to add his experience.Shea Kerrigan started as the lone man inside, with Cathal O’Hara doing the marking, but Claudy rotated the play – with Aaron Kerrigan and ‘Nugget’ both moving in there at dferent times.With the wind in their favour, the men in blue opened the scoring with two minutes gone, with Marty Donaghy spraying a crossfield pass to younger brother Aaron, and he had time and space inside the ’ to turn inside and chip a right-footed effort over the bar. Aaron Kerrigan doubled the advantage on four minutes with a well-struck free off the ground from the right sideline after Paddy Hargan was fouled.It was the tried and trusted who got Foreglen on the board seconds later when a quick burst of pace through the middle saw Oisin Duffy feed Kevin O’Connor, and he turned away from Callum McElhinney before pointing.A patient O’Brien’s move was ended with a Conal White interception, and it sent the Mitchel’s away. Marty Donaghy took possession on his own ’ and ran all the way into the Foreglen half before palming off the attentions of Eoghan Duffy and sending over a fantastic score – - to -.Pauric Morahan was next to show his pace as he evaded Stephen Farren and Aaron Donaghy down the right before finding Caolan O’Connor, but his attempt from  metres was controversially waved wide.Foreglen were enjoying a period of pressure after a slow start, and they reduced the gap to one on  minutes when a Morahan free was worked into the corner, and Cahir O’Connor turned away from Jamie Brown before fisting over from the angle, with the goal on.Aaron Kerrigan took his tally to two in the th minute when Paddy Hargan recovered after an initial fumble to get the ball through to the forward ahead of McCormick – who wanted the foul in midfield – but Kerrigan advanced on goal and chipped it beautully over the bar while off balance.Oisin Duffy’s runs from deep were being thwarted well early on, but he was stopped illegally by a heavy hit from Stephen Farren on the quarter hour mark. Barry Cassidy played the advantage and Liam O’Hara picked out Kevin O’Connor for the score – - to -.The game was levelled for the first time on  minutes when O’Connor won a soft free off Hargan on the  metre line, and the experienced forward dusted himself down to split the sticks.Claudy regained the lead three minutes later however, when Armstrong took a pass from Marty Donaghy and, despite having his arm pulled, managed to spin around and send one over from  metres off the left – - to -.He followed it up with a free after Eoin McGahon claimed the kick-out and Aaron Donaghy’s initial effort was well blocked down by James O’Kane before Armstrong was fouled, and converted.Another soft free in the Claudy defence after Fionain Smyth had initially won the turnover allowed O’Connor to take his tally to - and make it - to - on the board.Kevin then had the ball in the net after an initial Caolan O’Connor shot came back off the post, but it was ruled out as Cassidy had blown for a free. Mark McCormick slotted it over the top and, once again, it was a level playing field.Foreglen then took the lead for the first time in the final minute of normal time when patient play ended with McCormick fisting over the top for John Duffy in space, and he popped it over from  metres – issuing a cry into the ear of McGahon in celebration.The lead lasted just  seconds though as Hargan was fouled at the other end and the impressive Armstrong was on target with the free from the right.He was the man in form for Claudy, and he grabbed his fourth in added time when he latched on to a brilliant Aaron Kerrigan pass and sent it over off his weaker right foot to give the Mitchel’s the slimmest of leads at the break. Half-time:Claudy -Foreglen -  Pauric Morahan was moved into the half forward line at the start of the second-half on Blaine Carlin, with Sean O’Connor on Oran Armstrong.A pull from Jamie Brown on the shirt of Cahir O’Connor after he beat him for pace down the right allowed Mark McCormick to level things again within two minutes of the restart.The first manic moment came on  minutes when Marty Donaghy rode a heavy hit to feed Aaron, and his shot was batted down by Tiarnan Burke on the line and gathered in by John Duffy to prevent Conall White having an easy finish to the net.The Mitchel’s edged ahead again on  minutes and no surprise it was off the boot of Armstrong who curled a free off the ground and just over the bar, despite the efforts of McCormick on the line – - to -, but Claudy’s last.An Eoghan Duffy score after James O’Kane won the break from a Reilly kick-out came before Hargan struck the outside of the post after a fine Claudy move that started with some excellent skill from substitute Jamie Donaghy.Ciaran McFeely was also enjoying an influence off the bench, and he picked a pass in midfield to Kevin O’Connor who took a high tackle from McElhinney and opened his second-half account from the free after  minutes – - to - to Foreglen.The O’Brien’s stretched their lead to two for the first time in the game with  minutes left, when Caolan O’Connor was hacked down by Hargan but managed to get it away to Kevin for the point.The gap was three on  minutes when Aaron Kerrigan hesitated at one end and sent the ball wide, and from the kick-out Ciaran McFeely won the break and immediately looked for Kevin O’Connor. He found Liam O’Hara off the shoulder who chipped over the bar from ten metres – - to -.Foreglen’s dominance continued heading into added time as Eoghan Duffy found acres of space on the  metre line to stick it over the bar, followed by a super McCormick free from the right sideline.It was the midfielder who got the last score of the final with another free to signal wild celebrations from the green and gold.

Ref: Barry Cassidy .  MAN OF THE MATCHEoghan Duffy – Foreglen were resilient as a team in the first-half, but in the second they came to le – and a lot of it was down to Eoghan Duffy. He was everywhere, first to the ball, powerful on the run, and scored two super points. TURNING POINTChanges – When both teams needed to switch it up and break the cycle, it was Foreglen’s bench that proved the dference. Ciaran McFeely entered the fray after  minutes and took control in midfield to assert the Foreglen dominance. SCORE OF THE GAMEDonaghy point – It was only the one score for Marty Donaghy on the day, but it was typically brilliant. He took the ball inside his own half, ran the guts of  metres and then fired over on the spin, despite being under a lot of pressure.

Foreglen got the first score and once they get a lead, they are hard to peg back.“We will go away and scratch our heads and wonder how it got away from us but it is what it is. At the end of the day, Foreglen is a good side and congratulations to them.”When Oran Armstrong’s free escaped the clutches of Mark McCormick to give Claudy a th minute lead, - to - it proved to be their last score of the game.“We just couldn’t get it over the bar,” McGonigle expressed of how they slipped out of the game and pointed to the injury sustained by captain Marty Donaghy.“If it hadn’t have been Marty Donaghy, he would probably have been taken off. We kept him on thinking, he might get a snf of a goal but it didn’t really click today for us. We didn’t get them ball in well enough and the full-forward line just wasn’t able to get the scores we needed. You need the wee breaks, we didn’t get them today and that’s the way it goes.”McGonigle also gave credit to how Foreglen managed the game.“They suck the le out of you and once they get a lead, they are hard to get the ball off. They keep it tight and are good at killing out games. We knew thatthey got a lead, they’d be hard to claw back.”After winning the league, they will begin  in the top flight.“We will go away and lick our wounds but we’ll be back for senior football and we’ll give it a rattle. At the end of the day, this team is pretty young. Take Marty out of that, there is a really good core of young players there and that’s what we’ll be building on. Hopefully in the first ision, we will be able to give a good account of ourselves.”Speaking to the County Derry Post earlier in the season, former Derry forward Donaghy hinted that this season would be his last in the blue and white.“I can’t see him playing again,” McGonigle feels.  “It is hard for him. He has a lot of knocks and he has been hobbling about for half the season. “I’d say that’s Martynow but hopefully not, we could be doing with him for a few more years yet.We’ll see. Maybe a couple of months away from it is the best thing for him and see how he feels in January or February.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I saw halfway through the second half as well that Marty Donaghy was holding his arm, so it was probably a big loss to Claudy offensively when he wasn’t firing on all cylinders with the injury. “Again, you get the rub of the green some days. Big Mark McCormick hit two wonder scores from the sideline and whenever those go over you know it’s going to be your day, so we’re delighted.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Co-written withRTEacutebroadcasterJoe DuffyChildrenof the Troubles tells the story of  children aged  and under who died in the conflict between  and .Based on original interviews with almost  families, as well as extensive archival research it has an account about each victim and how they died.Mr Duffy had the idea for Children of the Troubles when he was working on his  book Children of the Rising and on hearing aboutFreya, who is Northern corespondent for the , asked her to get on board.It was a much bigger project than I think either of us realised, she admittedThere was so much research and so many interviews in the last year in particular.The pair painstakingly scoured newspapers and contacted victim supportgroups to help compile the book.You do wonder of there are any children we havent heard of, said MsMcClements.There may well be others whose deaths werent made public.That is why we did a lot of public appeals too through newspapers like the Derry News, asking families to come forward.Tragically, some of the children in the book have no surviving relatives.We have children in the book and there are some families that we werent bale to get in contact with.Some didnt have any survivingfamily and it was really sad as no one was able to speak on their behalf.There were also some families who didnt wish to speak, but they all wished us well with the book.For some of the families it was the first time they had spoken publicly about their loved one.We were very mindful that we were asking people about probably the worst thing that could ever happen to someone, continuedFreya.It was still very painful for them to revisit it.People said that we would be bringing things up for the families, but they said that was completely untrue because this is something they think about every single day.As a journalist I would always say its not about me, its about the families but you wouldnt be humanyou werent affected.There was one mother in particular, who I wont name, and we were just hugging each other.Joe andFreyaset out to show people who these children were.We very deliberately always started with something about the child, she explained.Sometimes there is a tendency in journalism to talk about the incident rather than the inidual.So we talked about the boy who wanted to be a priest or who loved playing outside.We made it something about them.You feel you get to know the children as people.What they liked to do, what they wanted to be when they grew up.The resulting book pays tribute to these young lives andFreyasays she is proud of what they have achieved.As a journalist I write a lot of things and then they are in tomorrows paper and then they are gone.But this feels a lot more permanent.All those children should still have been alive today and I would like to think people will come away with a sense of that.Even bringing the families togetherfor the launch felt signicant.The publication of the book has also led to talk of a permanent memorial for child victims of the Troubles.I would be led by the families in that, saidFreya.If it was something they thought they would like to see then I would be delighted for them.One of the things that Joe and I felt was remarkable was that there wasnt even a complete list of all the children that had died, and now they are talking about remembering them and I think that is very signicant.Its fantastic that conversation has got going. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In , O’Kane had fallen  feet from the masthead of a ship in Belfast docks. He sustained multiple injuries, primarily to the spine and hips. Despite six months’ treatment in hospital, his mobility was restricted and he could barely walk. At the beginning of , doctors advised him that only by amputating his right leg could his le be spared. “I would rather die with two legs than live with one,” he said. He refused the operation, deciding to seek a cure in Lourdes. “I knew thatI reached Lourdes I would be made fit and well,” he remarked.Immediately after his arrival, he noticed an improvement in his mobility. “I thought I felt slightly better,” he said. The following day – a Sunday – he felt even stronger. “I walked from my bed to the dressing table on Sunday morning – the first time I had walked unaided from the date of the accident,” he reflected. On that day, he also walked to the grotto. He did so without using his stick. He brought it with him, however, but only to discard it. After adding his stick to the pile of crutches – and having offered thanks to Our Lady – he then walked away unaided. “The pilgrims who saw him on the outward journey are astonished at his present condition,” one news report commented.O’Kane’s we was overjoyed to see her husband on his . She had gone to the railway station to meet him. “I was looking into the carriage windows to see where he was and help him out and get his bags,” Mrs. O’Kane remarked. “When he went away he was on sticks, and could only walk with dficulty. “Imagine my feelings when I saw a smiling man walking fit and well towards me. I could hardly believe it was my husband. “I could hardly keep from crying with joy.” Not long after his , O’Kane said: “I hope to visit Lourdes next Easter, in thanksgiving to Our Lady of Lourdes, andpossible each succeeding year.” He was also clear about where, and to whom, his gratitude was due – “Lourdes and the intervention of Our Lady.” Co-author Keane has published  books, including eight No. bestsellers, among them “The Little Flower: St. Theacuteregravese of Lisieux and Padre Pio: Irish Encounters with the Saint.” Una O’Hagan is a number one bestselling author and former newsreader with Radio Telefiacutes Eacuteireann.  She has anchored all the main news bulletins and interviewed Nelson Mandela, among others. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In , O’Kane had fallen  feet from the masthead of a ship in Belfast docks. He sustained multiple injuries, primarily to the spine and hips. Despite six months’ treatment in hospital, his mobility was restricted and he could barely walk. At the beginning of , doctors advised him that only by amputating his right leg could his le be spared. “I would rather die with two legs than live with one,” he said. He refused the operation, deciding to seek a cure in Lourdes. “I knew thatI reached Lourdes I would be made fit and well,” he remarked.Immediately after his arrival, he noticed an improvement in his mobility. “I thought I felt slightly better,” he said. The following day – a Sunday – he felt even stronger. “I walked from my bed to the dressing table on Sunday morning – the first time I had walked unaided from the date of the accident,” he reflected. On that day, he also walked to the grotto. He did so without using his stick. He brought it with him, however, but only to discard it. After adding his stick to the pile of crutches – and having offered thanks to Our Lady – he then walked away unaided. “The pilgrims who saw him on the outward journey are astonished at his present condition,” one news report commented.O’Kane’s we was overjoyed to see her husband on his . She had gone to the railway station to meet him. “I was looking into the carriage windows to see where he was and help him out and get his bags,” Mrs. O’Kane remarked. “When he went away he was on sticks, and could only walk with dficulty. “Imagine my feelings when I saw a smiling man walking fit and well towards me. I could hardly believe it was my husband. “I could hardly keep from crying with joy.” Not long after his , O’Kane said: “I hope to visit Lourdes next Easter, in thanksgiving to Our Lady of Lourdes, andpossible each succeeding year.” He was also clear about where, and to whom, his gratitude was due – “Lourdes and the intervention of Our Lady.” Co-author Keane has published  books, including eight No. bestsellers, among them “The Little Flower: St. Theacuteregravese of Lisieux and Padre Pio: Irish Encounters with the Saint.” Una O’Hagan is a number one bestselling author and former newsreader with Radio Telefiacutes Eacuteireann.  She has anchored all the main news bulletins and interviewed Nelson Mandela, among others. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last season Academy vied with Limavady and Clogher Valley for top spot in the league all year so Limavady expected a dficult encounter.Limavady got off to a bright start which resulted in Ben Riley scoring from a fine inidual effort when he broke clear from the half way line to touch down under the posts Luke Faulkner converted. For most of the first half the game was tightly fought until the th minute when Stewart Roddy ran in a score following good work from Luke Montgomery. Luke Faulkner again converted. Just before half time Limavady scored two further tries which effectively killed the game off. Following a good break from Peter Wilson at scrum half Ben Riley was on his shoulder to take the try scoring pass. The bonus point try came when captain Jody McMurray spotted that the home defence had gone to sleep when he coolly strolled in under the posts. Luke again converted to take the half time score to . in Limavady’s favour.The second half continued in much the same vein. Limavady scored first when Peter Wilson broke from the ten metre line to outpace the home defence and score in the corner. Luke Faulkner, in excellent form with the boot this year, once again stepped up with the conversion.Academy managed to hit back with a try of their own, however it was only a matter of time until Limavady would score again. Gavin Martin, now playing in the out half position, managed to make a break and fed Stewart Roddy for his second try of the game. Try number seven came as a result of a long clearance kick from Luke Faulkner which was brilliantly chased down by Stewart Roddy. Putting pressure on Academy’s last line of defence Roddy managed to secure ball and fed inside to Stuart Morrow following up in support. Jody McMurray converted.The only other score was a late consolation effort by Academy when they again crossed in the corner.To top off an excellent day Limavady nds also won convincingly . with tries from Jason Kerr , JamieMillar , Aaron Reilly , John Purcell, Jack Elliott, and Harry McAleese. Harry converted nine of these ten tries.No fixtures for either side next week. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last season Academy vied with Limavady and Clogher Valley for top spot in the league all year so Limavady expected a dficult encounter.Limavady got off to a bright start which resulted in Ben Riley scoring from a fine inidual effort when he broke clear from the half way line to touch down under the posts Luke Faulkner converted. For most of the first half the game was tightly fought until the th minute when Stewart Roddy ran in a score following good work from Luke Montgomery. Luke Faulkner again converted. Just before half time Limavady scored two further tries which effectively killed the game off. Following a good break from Peter Wilson at scrum half Ben Riley was on his shoulder to take the try scoring pass. The bonus point try came when captain Jody McMurray spotted that the home defence had gone to sleep when he coolly strolled in under the posts. Luke again converted to take the half time score to . in Limavady’s favour.The second half continued in much the same vein. Limavady scored first when Peter Wilson broke from the ten metre line to outpace the home defence and score in the corner. Luke Faulkner, in excellent form with the boot this year, once again stepped up with the conversion.Academy managed to hit back with a try of their own, however it was only a matter of time until Limavady would score again. Gavin Martin, now playing in the out half position, managed to make a break and fed Stewart Roddy for his second try of the game. Try number seven came as a result of a long clearance kick from Luke Faulkner which was brilliantly chased down by Stewart Roddy. Putting pressure on Academy’s last line of defence Roddy managed to secure ball and fed inside to Stuart Morrow following up in support. Jody McMurray converted.The only other score was a late consolation effort by Academy when they again crossed in the corner.To top off an excellent day Limavady nds also won convincingly . with tries from Jason Kerr , JamieMillar , Aaron Reilly , John Purcell, Jack Elliott, and Harry McAleese. Harry converted nine of these ten tries.No fixtures for either side next week. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

She insists that she intends to deliver the authentic voice of moderate, progressive Irish nationalism in a place where it needs to be heard.And she has vowed to be a hard working Peer, lobbying and building alliances with other peers and parties across the chamber that will bring benefit to people in Northern Ireland.And while the former MP regrets no longer being a member of the SDLP, she said her political views have not altered and will reflect the partyrsquos central social democratic messages focused on the needs of people and the principles of equality, fairness and social justice for all in the House of Lords.With her new title now confirmed, Baroness Ritchie described Downpatrick as a ldquohistoric place on the island of Ireland, where St Patrick began and ended his ministry.ldquoThe town is a place of immense heritage and has a longstanding history. It is uniquely associated on the island with the patron saint and is also associated with the Normans and the Vikings, she continued.ldquoDownpatrick is also place of inclusion and a shared society. The area was one of the first to share power at local government level and in the days of the old Urban Council, it had responsibility for allocating housing and did so very much on the basis of need.The Baroness said the Downpatrick area was very much at the vanguard of political inclusion in terms of ensuring that people belonged, explaining that she plans to use her new title to promote the town.Her House of Lords induction takes place on November  with her formal introduction taking place the following day when she will be introduced by her two sponsors on the floor of the chamber.Baroness Ritchiersquos sponsors will be former Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Lord Paul Murphy and Baroness Angela Smith, who is the shadow leader of the Lords.She is also former NIO minister who was responsible for the the health, economy and environment portfolios during her time at Stormont.Lord Murphy was also Minister of State and led the British Government in the talks process that led to the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie continued: ldquoI have picked my two sponsors on the basis that while I am going into the House of Lords as non-aligned and independent, my two sponsors understand the mechanics of the Good Friday Agreement and understand inclusion and power-sharing.ldquoMy maiden speech will hopefully take place sometime before the end of the year, although that could be subject to changea general election is called.Looking to the future, the Baroness said she has been using the past few weeks to get briefed on key issues which are important to her, including Brexit and its impact on the agri-food economy and local economy.ldquoTo me, there is no such thing as a good Brexit. The best deal for me is one where we will remain in the EU. What we have been presented with is one that is a bita curatersquos egg in many ways. There will ne no hard border which means no economic border and no veto in terms of the Assembly. Having said that, I am going to have to examine the Brexit deal in greater depth, she continued.ldquoThere are other issues that I want to focus on including the contaminated bloods issue, tourism VAT and what can be done to help our economy and ensure that we can grow and develop. The vaginal mess issue is something I have been associated with as is the importance of the Co Down fishing industry.Baroness Ritchie said while she does not have constituents, she will be speaking in a general Northern Ireland-wide context.ldquoI will be highlighting the importance of reflecting our political ersity and respect for political dference, ensuring that our institutions are up and running and that they respect the relationships between Ireland and Britain and Northern Ireland and the South.

The three of them were regularly checking the weather in the last few weeks leading up to race day as the temperatures were well up in the high s.Far too hot to be running a marathon, but thankfully in the final week it took a dramaticdown to nine degrees. Flying over on Friday with no time to waste, it was straight to the hotel and then immediately to the Expo to pick up their race numbers and buy some of the many race souvenirs that were on sale.In the Expo there was a wall of fame for all the runners who had completed the six majors. Murlough ACrsquos very own Paula McKibbin and Ann McAlarneyrsquos names were spotted on the wall for all to see.There was no time to get over the six-hours jet lag as they were all up at five in the morning and headed downtown to the start of the km friendship run.This was a bit of fun and involved a quick lap of the city centre finishing in Grant park. The rest of the day was spent in true MAC style with a boat cruise along the Chicago river before dinner in an Italian restaurant.The evening got better as needing a taxi for six people to take them back to the hotel, they managed to acquire the use of a party limousine at a very good rate.Another early start on Sunday as the marathon began at .am in the neighbouring Grant Park. Thankfully, it was only a  minute walk from the hotel. Theyrsquod only just made it into the corrals and the race started.A field of , runners, heading off north through the city, with defending champion Mo Farah expected to retain his title.As the route wound through the city it passed through many dferent districts, all with a party atmosphere and lined with people cheering and screaming encouragement.The noise during a major marathon in the USA is beyond belief, the bands playing, spectators lsquohigh fivingrsquo and the streets lined with people three or four thick is an experience like no other. We passed through the Mexican Quarter with bands playing and guys dancing, wearing sombreros and then on to Chinatownrsquo with the streets lined with drummers.It was then onto the Gay Quarter with drag queens performing on stage. It was a celebration for both runners and spectators.As with all marathons, the last five miles were a real test of mental determination as fatigue kicked in and Carol, unfortunately, was suffering from a knee injury that she picked up during training which ed at mile .They all pushed on with Hugh crossing the line first and recording a new personal best by one and a half minutes. Orla was next home followed by Charisse who recorded a huge personal best of  minutes.Carol was next home and managed to finish in a respectable time as she battled through the final  miles with knee problems. As the runners walked down the street after finishing they were greeted by four lines of local school kids applauding and congratulating all the runners. After the kids there were long tables either side of the street where one of the local sponsors, which happened to be a brewery, handing out free beer. Then onto the next table where they were given food and water.It makes you wonder what is not to like about this marathon  In the ladiesrsquo race a new world record was set as Brigid Kosgei beat Paula Radclfersquos record of  years. Ironically, as Carol finished her race and walked down to collect her medal she was presented with it from no other than Paula herself.It was back to the hotel to get ready for dinner that evening. As Hugh and Charisse walked back they talked about getting a pint of milk each for recovery.As the shop was a ten-minute walk away, Charisse said that even though she knew it would be a bit more expensive she was happy to buy milk for them both in the hotel bar.Being content with the two half pints that the bar served it was only when the bill was produced that they both discovered that they must have drunk the most expensive two glasses of milk ever, with a bill of  dollars. Anything to save tired feet.That evening they continued in MAC style, celebrating with a meal on Cindyrsquos roof top restaurant followed by a few beers in Buddy Guyrsquos Blues bar where we were treated in style with a table in the VIP area. The le of a Murlough AC member is indeed a good one and already planning has begun for the next Major.Meanwhile, the week before, Kieran McShane made the long trek to Australia to complete in the Melbourne Marathon.The race began with an early am start along Batman Avenue in the glorious sunshine. This was Kieranrsquos first big run in over three months due to injuries, so took him a lot longer to finish, but he says it just meant he had more time to take in the lovely views of Melbourne.It was an amazing race from start to finish taking in all the iconic places around Melbourne such as St Paulrsquos Cathedral, Flinders Street, Botanic Gardens and the Shrine of Remembrance.Followed by a lap around the GP circuit then up and down St Kildarsquos beach along the promenade.

Letter to the editorAs Ben Lowry asserted in his column ‘Middle England chose Brexit over NI fully in UK,’ October , Boris Johnson’s loyalty is first and foremost to the Conservative party and its English electorate. It was always going to be the case and therein lies the harsh lesson for unionism to learn . It is imperative that unionists consolidate and ensure that maintaining the Union remains in our own hands. That is the battle line drawn for the next election when unionists bite the bullet andthe maximum number of MPs possible to hold firm for the unionist cause .We have been here before with shyster prime ministers and survived. This time we now know in advance where we all stand in terms of having our unionism undermined. What unionism requires are cool heads, sharp minds and positive leadership as never before . Solidarity tied into a unity of defence and purpose in upholding the integrity of the Union and reasserting our right to self determination is the number one unionist priority.David McNarry, Comber©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  People   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News People Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           People      Carrickrsquos Gin Palace inSessions finalA cracking young band with a strong Carrickfergus influence are aiming to be Northern Ireland#s newest music sensation.

He made clear that his party will not stand aside for the DUP in any constituency.In an interview with the News Letter yesterday, Mr Aiken also set out a series of areas in which he will change the party, but stressed that he would not do away with the party’s conscience votes for members in areas such as abortion.The former commander of a Royal Navy nuclear submarine said that he wanted “to get the Ulster Unionist Party to a position where it can represent...solid British values”..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button He said that st century liberal Britain is “a very attractive place to be” and that is one of the reasons why so many people from the island of Ireland who go to Britain for university like it and stay.The Ballyclare man said: “That in many ways is quite absent in Northern Ireland at the moment amongst a particular grouping actually what we need to do in Northern Ireland is get that sense of Manchester, Liverpool, whatever it is, and use that to secure the Union”.However, he was scathing about the DUP, particularly in relation to its record at Stormont and the mess of the Brexit negotiations.Two years ago, the UUP insisted that it had not entered a formal pact with the DUP but made what it described as a “unilateral decision” not to stand in North Belfast and instead backed the DUP.\u2028The DUP indid not stand in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, backing the UUP.In the General Election before that, in , the party was open about the fact that it had struck a deal with the DUP not to challenge each other in certain seats.However, when askedthe UUP would stand aside for the DUP in some seats, Mr Aiken bluntly and emphatically told this newspaper: “No. We’re not standing aside. We’re going to fight all  constituencies.”Askedhe would regret his decision to run  candidatesit was to cost someone like Nigel Dodds his seat, Mr Aiken said: “Nigel Dodds and the DUP made it very clear, time and time again, that they don’t need Ulster Unionist support and we didn’t put a border down the Irish Sea Nigel Dodds needs to answer that question.”\u2028Mr Dodds, the DUP’s Westminster leader and one of its most capable figures, is its most electorally vulnerable MP.In , even with the UUP standing aside, Sinn Fein was just , votes behind the DUP deputy leader.The last time when the UUP stood in the constituency was two years ago when in the Assembly election Robert Foster, a low-profile candidate, polled , votes.Arlene Foster: Leo Varadkar set a precedent for loyalists with talk of violence Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"However, since then the UUP’s vote has fallen across Northern Ireland and Westminster elections traditionally invovle tactical voting for one of the candidates who is capable of winning, so the UUP’s vote would likely be much lower than that in the forthcoming election.\u2028The Sinn Fein candidate, John Finucane, is Belfast’s Lord Mayor and has signicantly raised his profile since last standing against Mr Dodds.Mr Aiken is still new to politics, having first been elected to any political post when he entered the Assembly as an MLA just three-and-a-half years ago. The South Antrim MLA’s decision not to pursue even a limited pact will not be welcomed by some UUP members and supporters but indicates that he is prepared to take risks in attempting to turn around what has appeared to be the unending decline of the UUP over the last two decades.The UUP supported Remain in the EU referendum – although its members were ided –but then adopted the stance that it accepted the will of voters to leave the EU and the result must be implemented.Mr Aiken, however, said that the way in which the UK chooses to leave must not involve any fresh checks in the Irish Sea or at the Irish border, which “in effect means something much closer to the Customs Union”.He said that at present Brexiteers in Northern Ireland faced a poor choice – either a deal which is not really Brexit for Northern Ireland, or keeping the UK together at the expense of their desire for the whole UK to leave the EU.Referring to the DUP’s recent U-turn to back a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, Mr Aiken said: “I cannot understand for the le of me – and I know we joke about ‘jot and tittle’ and Arlene and [DUP chief executive] Timmy Johnston not being all over the detail – but how did we ever get in a situation where the DUP, the supposed supporters of the Union, have been one of the biggest detractors from it and through the agreement to put a border down the Irish Sea have created a place apart  That is extraordinary.”Mr Aiken, who made clear that he was pragmatically in favour of the EU rather than being enthusiastic about Brussels, said that the UUP needed to provide an alternative because “at the momentyou are voting unionist...the only thing you’re in essence supporting is Brexit”Mr Aiken said that the UUP would either back a form of Brexit which did not damage the Union, or,that is not possible, then remaining in the EU in order to preserve the Union.try catch  TrendingLATEST | Police arrest second N.I. manin connection with  dead people discovered in lorry container in connection with  dead people discovered in lorry container\"Essex lorry deaths: PSNI search two NI addresses after  bodies foundNI braces itself for storm battering and theres a big chill on the way tooDavid McNarry: PM disgracefully humiliated Dodds.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees.

Any proposals would be subject to full consultation, meaning all interested parties would have an opportunity to share their views before any decision is made.ldquoShould proposals progress, they would also be subject to separate planning consultation.ldquoThis would include consideration of highways and traffic concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have had nine spaces taken away, which means  cars will be battling for spaces.ldquoWe understand the need to reduce cars and danger in the area but the way itrsquos been done will lead to reductions in house prices and make parking dficult for current residents.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections.

However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in .

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey. APCOA sees this investment as strengthening their position in Northern Ireland and providing a  for increased growth.Combining the existing APCOA expertise and customer base across both countries, this acquisition now makes APCOA a leading mobile parking operator in cashless parking providing convenient, cashless and cost-effective payment options to nearly , parking customers.Both APCOA and NCPS see this as a real opportunity to broaden the strength of services to clients and to improve capabilities by bringing together the best knowledge, systems and operational practice. Kim Challis, regional managing director for APCOA UK  Ireland, said: “The businesses complement each other well across dferent geographies and business sectors and both have strong management and operational teams.  “There are opportunities to share innovation and technology solutions from both companies across the whole business, and also to benefit from the on-going investment and business experience that comes from APCOA UK  Ireland being part of a larger European group. We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year. With every acquisition, we have pursued a clear strategy: not to become a property owner. Thanks to its consistent ‘asset light’ business model, APCOA has established itself as a reliable partner, maximising the value of both private and public property owners’ assets. “At the same time, APCOA offers consumers a range of products and services that are increasingly digital and that span the entire market.” These acquisitions have enabled APCOA to expand its presence in each market and position itself for further profitable growth.
